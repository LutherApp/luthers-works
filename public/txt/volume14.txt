Foreword. 


The old edition of Walch contains in its 
fourteenth volume two main parts, each of which 
is provided with special pagination. The first part 
contains Luther's prefaces, as well as historical 
and philological writings; the second part contains 
the Latin translation of the Bible, which was 
published anonymously in Wittenberg in 1529 and 
is attributed to Luther. It contains the Pentateuch, 
the Book of Joshua, the Book of Judges, the 
Books of Kings and the entire New Testament. We 
have retained the first part, but with the elimination 
of many pieces that are not by Luther, as will be 
shown soon, and in the same order as Walch. On 
the other hand, the second part has been omitted, 
because it does not belong in our complete 
German edition, and also has only an 
archaeological interest. The space thus freed has 
been used by us to accommodate the extremely 
rich material, which has been brought to light by 
the finds of recent times, and in our sixth volume, 
where it actually belongs, could not be included 
due to lack of space. Thus, the second part of this 
volume has become a supplement to the sixth 
volume. We have arranged it with consecutive 
pagination. 


The name of the cursor is the same as the name 
of the cursor. 

Walch has four subsections for Luther's 
prefaces. The first section contains Luther's 
prefaces to the German translation of the Bible, 
arranged according to the sequence of the biblical 
books. In this section, we have added Luther's 
"Warning" from the Bible edition of 1545, as well 
as the "Preface of Jesus Sirach to his Book’, 
which were missing in Walch's edition, and have 
placed the "Preface to the Revelation of St. John" 
from 1522 in the text, which Walch, because 
Luther later suppressed it, had relegated to his 
preface to the 14th volume. We have given the 
fourth number a more correct chronology. 

In the second subsection, "Luther's Prefaces 
on Some Interpretations of Biblical Books 
Prepared by Others," which are also arranged 
according to the Holy Scriptures, we have made 
no other change than that we have here (as 
everywhere in this volume) newly translated from 
Latin all the prefaces whose original is Latin. 

The third subsection, "Luther's Prefaces on 
Various Books and Writings Prepared by Others," 
has already been

Foreword. 





by Walch in chronological order. Here and there 
we have helped to determine the correct time, e.g. 
in the first two numbers. However, we had to leave 
the last two numbers at their previous place, 
because a transfer was not well thunlich. We have 
omitted the "Preface on Joh. Walther's Spiritual 
Songs" because it is duplicated in Walch's work 
and is therefore already included in our edition in 
Vol. X, 1422. Likewise, the "Preface on Antonius 
Corvinus' Bichlein wider des Erasmus Tractat" 2c. 
is also duplicated in Walch, and is already found in 
our edition, vol. XVIII, 2006. The "Preface on the 
Latin and German BegrabniBgesange" is already 
printed in the St. Louis edition, vol. X, 1424, and is 
therefore omitted here. Also the title of several 
writings had to be changed, because it was either 
wrong or misleading. For example, Walch's No. 62 
has the title: "Vorrede uber das 
Passionalbtchlein" ("Preface to the Passional 
Booklet"), which gives the impression that this 
preface is part of the "Passional Christi und 
Antichristi" ("Passion of Christ and Antichrist"). 
However, it should read: "Preface to the Prayer 
Booklet with the Calendar and Passion. Walch's 
No. 54 has the title: "Preface to the Harmony of the 
Passion of Christ", whereby one naturally thinks of 
a Gospel harmony. However, it should read: 
"Preface to the Songs of the Passion of Christ. 

The "Passional Christi und Antichristi" has 
been provided with Cranach's pictures, and a 
detailed introduction according to the Weimar 
edition has been added. 

The preface No. 53a, which forms a whole with 
the following, has been transferred here from 
Walch's 21st volume, Col. 181%. 





In the fourth subsection, which in Walch has 
the title: "D. M. Luthers Vorreden Uber die 
Sammlungen und Editiones seiner Schriften, 
nebst den vor den lateinischen und deutschen 
Wittenbergischen, auch Jenischen, Eislebischen, 
Altenburgischen und Leipzigischen  Theilen 
befindlichen Vorreden und Zueignungsschriften", 
we have found it necessary to tidy up sharply. Of 
the forty-seven numbers Walch has in this section, 
we have retained only seven; of these, five are by 
Luther. The sixth piece, Melanchthon's preface to 
the second part of Luther's Latin writings, is 
important and deserves a place in a collection of 
Luther's writings, because it offers a_ brief 
biography of Luther; the seventh piece, Amsdorf's 
preface to the first volume of the Jena German 
edition (the only preface ever added to this 
important edition), which also precedes the Latin 
parts in a Latin translation, is historically valuable 
and interesting. It should only be noted here that 
the "Preface of Luther before his farewell", which 
precedes the second part of the Wittenberg edition 
and is reprinted in all previous Luther editions 
(except the Jena edition), is not a preface by 
Luther, but a conglomerate of his writings, which 
Walch has already stated several times as a 
conjecture. The beginning of this so-called preface 
is, as we have already noted in the 20th volume of 
the St. Louis edition, Col. 1619, from Luther's 
writing: "Wider die Antinomer"; then follows a 
small middle sentence, whose location we have 
not succeeded in finding; the conclusion, however, 
is taken from Luther's "Preface to the Urban 
Rhegius 


Foreword. 


VII 





Refutation of the Munster New Valentinians" 2c., 
in this volume Col. 348 ff., 4-9. Therefore, we think 
we have rightly omitted this piece. It would be 
difficult for anyone to agree with us about the other 
omissions as well. For if we had wanted to follow 
Walch's path and continue along it, we would have 
had to exclude, in addition to the forty pieces we 
have omitted, all of Walch's prefaces and 
introductions, the Erlangen edition, and the 
Weimar edition (as far as it has been published). 
But that would be a strange "collection of Luther's 
works"! 

In the last section of the first main part of this 
volume, "Luther's Historical and Philological 
Writings", we have been able to make significant 
improvements in Luther's Chronikon. We have 
purged it of Aurifaber's many additions, especially 
in the New Testament period, and cut off its 
continuation from 1540 to 1559. The arrangement 
is clearer and more concise than Walch's, 
because we have, as was done in the old editions, 
always brought fifty years out of each page, so 
that the two facing pages make up a hundred 
years. This writing, as well as the following 
"Namenbichlein" we have newly translated from 
the Latin and freed from many errors. No. 5 of this 
section, "Aesop's Fable of the Lion and the 
Donkey", which was previously given in all 
editions in the wrong order, is now in the correct 
order. The only text in this volume that was written 
in Latin and could not be retranslated by us, 
because we did not have the original Latin, is 
"Luthers Bernunftkunst". Des 





We were forced to reprint it after the translation by 
Aug. Tittel from Walch. 


Now we turn to the second main part of this 
volume, the supplement of the sixth volume, which 
brings the conclusion of Luther's interpretation of 
the Old Testament, namely the interpretations on 
the prophets Obadiah to Malachi. The 
interpretations of the prophets Jonah, Habakkuk 
and Zechariah were published by Luther himself in 
German, therefore the old editions do not bring any 
other relation besides these. We, however, like the 
Erlangen and Weimar editions, have added to 
these three prophets the Altenburg manuscript and 
to the first two also the Zwickau manuscript; why 
this was not also done for Zechariah can be seen 
from the first note to the second interpretation of 
the prophet Zechariah. Luther's interpretation of 
the prophet Haggai was not available at the time 
the Wittenberg edition was published. Therefore, 
Melanchthon wrote a short explanation about this 
prophet, which was added to the Wittenberg 
edition, but found no exception in the other 
editions. We now bring the interpretation of the 
prophet Haggai according to both the Altenburg 
and the Zwickau manuscripts after the Weimar 
edition. In the case of the other prophets, in 
addition to these two manuscripts, we have only 
reproduced the text of Micah according to Veit 
Dietrich's edition, because Luther had approved of 
it. For the others, the text of the Altenburg 
manuscript has been used as a basis, but the 
deviations of Dietrich are as follows

find referred to in the notes. We have discussed 
what led us to this procedure in the first note on the 
Prophet Joel, Vol. VI, 1414 ff. Only in Malachi do 
these two manuscripts fail, and we have included 
this according to the Wittenberg edition. 

Now we continue with the critique of the 
Weimar edition, which we began in the sixth 
volume. Only occasionally do we touch upon the 
Erlangen edition, because, given the condition it 
has in the exeg. opp. tom. XXIV-XXVIII, it gives too 
much opportunity for justified criticism. 

In Obadiah according to the Altenburg 
manuscript, in the Weimar edition vol. XIII, p. 215, 
line 5 (at the beginning of the introduction) 4th 
Regum is found, for which 3rd Regum is to be 
read, because the passage is | Kings 18, 4. - p. 
217, line 5 v. u. (v. 5. in Meirich's editing) is to be 
read furabuntur instead of firmabuntur. The wrong 
reading is found in all editions. - P. 222, line 27 (v. 
20.) we read: pressuros totum terram, for which 
possessuros totam terram is to be put. In addition, 
we encounter several insignificant typographical 
errors. Two verse numbers are missing. In 
Obadiah according to the Zwickau manuscript, six 
verse numbers are missing. This has, as one can 
see from the following, bad consequences. - P. 
209, line 8 (v. 2.) is to be read cogitur instead of 
eoxit. - P. 209, line 19 (v. 3.) Quia Kallas is to be 
read instead of Qui habitat. - S. 210 the. Remark 
is made, "The Zwickau manuscript has thus 
contracted pp. 5-7. and the Hallische manuscript 
has arranged the individual cues." However, it 
does not behave this way. The verse number "6." 
would have preceded "eyn" on p. 210, line 19, and 
the relevant 





Keyword should have been added. The verse 
number "7." should not have been placed first line 
19, but line 16 before emittent te etc., and these 
words had to be emphasized as a keyword. - The 
verse number "9." should have been placed p. 
211, lines-4 before Timebunt; the verse number 
"11." should have been p. 211, line 13 before In 
die; the verse number "13." should have been p. 
211, line 24 before Ruinae. - P. 212, line 20 should 
be read possidebunt instead of possederunt. - P. 
212, line 25, the verse number "18." should be 
inserted before In i8ta and the relevant keyword 
should be added. Because this was not done, we 
have here in the text quite incomprehensible 
things: In Ili ista generali possessione gentium 
possi [debit] etiam pars domus Jacob, domus 


Joseph, regnum Israel. First, therefore, the 
eighteenth verse would have to be inserted as a 
keyword, instead of possidebit to add: 


possidebitur, and then, according to the Hallic and 
Altenburg manuscripts, the text would have to be 
completed thus: In ista generali possessione 
gentium possidebitur etiam pars, domus Esau. 
Domus Jacobi. e. reliquiae salvatae per Christum. 
Domus Joseph i. e. regnum Israel. - P. 213, line 
13 (v. 19.) is wrongly interpointed: [The Christians] 
"these are such" valles versus occidentem. 
Possidebunt Philistim. It should read: . . . valles. 
Versus occidentem possidebunt etc. 

In the interpretation of the prophet Jonah 
according to the Altenburg manuscript, in the 
Weimar edition vol. XIII, p. 249, line 34 (Cap. 2, 3.) 
fidendum is found where diffidendum will have to 
be read; p. 250, line 32 (Cap. 2, 5.) sententiis 
instead of conscientiis p. 255, line 28 (Cap. 4, 


Einl.) dissimilis instead of similis. In the 


interpretation of Jonah according to the Zwickau 
manuscript p. 225, line 7 (introduction)

we find Josia instead of Jonah; p. 226, line 21 
habentes instead of labentes; p. 227, line 6 (Cap. 
1, 1.) noverit instead of moverit; p. 228, line 23 the 
word Deus is missing after: alius vir est. - p. 229, 
line 2 of the notes is propitius instead of 
perspicuus. - P. 231, line 16 (Cap. 2 at the 
beginning) is to be read: omnibus instead of nimis; 
likewise line 26 is to be read digereretur instead of 
deglutiretur; likewise line 31 is to be read instead 
of Si: Sic. - p. 232, line 12 (Cap. 2, 3.) Exaudivit 
should be the keyword, not Exaudisti, which soon 
follows in the Vulgate. - S. 232, Z. 22 (Cap. 2, 4.) 
according to the Vulgate the keyword should be: 
Projecisti me, not: Projecisti eum. - P. 234, Z. 8 
(Cap. 2, 8.), where the Weimar edition offers: 
Summa summarum est hujus carminis : opera non 
juvant, sanctitas, sanctitas, will be read according 
to the Hall manuscript: opera non valent, nullius 
sanctitas, sapientia. The Erlanger has: "Summa 
summarum est hujus camis opera non . . 
sanctitas, sa:". - P. 235, line 2 of the notes should 
be read instead of VI6II8: vicos. - P. 237, line 4 
(Cap. 3, 8.) will read instead of Aliam: Illam. - P. 
238, Z. 30 (Cap. 4, 3.) is to be read instead of: 
mors mea et vita mea according to the Vulgate: 
Mors mea est melior quam vita mea. - There we 
find: "that does: ferendum". Instead of ferendum, 
with which the Weimar edition has filled a gap, 
"wehe" will have to be read. - P. 238, line 32 (Cap. 
4, 4.) is to be read according to the Vulgate instead 
of penitus: bene. This error will have to be 
attributed to an interrogation of the rewriter. - S. 
239, line 20 (Cap. 4, 6.) has the Weimar: foliis 
similis, cauda for which 

(according to Luther's German interpretation) will 
read: foliis similis cauli. - S. 239, Z. 27 (Cap. 4, 8.) 
is instead of deli 





ciens according to the Vulgate: deficient. - P. 240, 
line 14 (end of the interpretation) offers the 
Weimar: nonne Ninive plus hic quam Jonas etc.. 
Instead read: Viri Ninivitae . . .; plus hic quam 
Jonas etc. These are the first and the last words of 
the scriptural quotation Matth. 12, 41, which was 
easy to recognize, since immediately the words: 
Iterum citat in Matthaeo:" precede it. 

Because the thirteenth volume of the Weimar 
edition contains the interpretation of all minor 
prophets, we no longer give the number of this 
volume in the following, but only the page number. 
In the notes on Micah according to the Altenburg 
manuscript p. 300, line 2 (middle of the 
introduction) is to be read aeternum instead of 
externum; ibid. line 23 Babyloniam instead of 
externum; line 24 Babyloniorum instead of 
Assyriam. - p. 301, line 4 is (according to the 
Vulgate) instead of ducent: to be read ducet. - S. 


.|305, Z. 11 (Cap. 1, 9.) should be read Babylonica 


instead of Assyriaca - S. 310, Z. 6 (Cap. 2, 4.) 
should be read ejus instead of eis. - In the third 
chapter the first four verse numbers are missing, 
and the fifth is incorrectly placed on p. 314, line 28, 
while it should have been placed already on line 
22. - In the fourth chapter, the verse number "4." is 
only on p. 319, line 20, but should have been 
placed already on line 17. - The verse number "7." 
should have been inserted on p. 320, line 22 
before ponam, etc. - S. 322, Z. 34 (Cap. 4, 11.) the 
second non is to be deleted. This is not a printing 
error, because the Erlanger also reads: non 
habitabis non amplius. - S. 328, line 16 (Cap. 5, 7.) 
should have read 


X 


Foreword. 





Tales according to the Vulgate the verse number 
"8." should be put and the keyword should be 
added. - S. 331, Z. 28 (Cap. 6, 5.) should be read 
Gilgal instead of Gilead - S. 333, Z. 31 (Cap. 6, 8.) 
should be read placeamus instead of placemus. - 
$.334, Z.25 (Cap. 6, 8.) in the margin should be 
instead of "Weish." Sirach should be put. - S. 336, 
Z. 36 (Cap. 6, 14.) the first non is to be deleted. 
The Erlanger has noted here: Deleas: non. - S. 
338, Z. 3 (Cap. 7, 2.) we read: ut Ozeas supra ait: 
Rectus non est in hominibus. Here one thinks to 
have to do with a quotation from Hosea; but this is 
not the case. It should read: ut Ozeas supra ait 
[Cap. 4, 1. sq.]. The following words: Rectus 2c. 
should have been assigned to the following 
paragraph, because they are a part of the next 
keyword. On this occasion, we do not want to 
leave it unmentioned that the editor of the 13th 
volume of the Weimar edition did not take any 
special trouble to prove the scriptural passages 
that occur in the interpretations. As proof of this, 
we cite the fact that on pages 319 to 343, only five 
Scripture citations are given in the margin, and of 
these five, two are incorrect, namely p. 324, line 
25 (which we have already mentioned) Weish. 3, 
20., and p. 340, Z. 12: Ps. 97, 11. where Ps. 112, 
4. should be given. The third passage, p. 327, line 
8: Hoc est verbo Dei, gladio spiritus, ut inquit 
apostolus, where "Eph. 6, 17." is mentioned in the 
margin, is not a citation, nor would it have been 
necessary, because it is well known. The fourth 
passage, p. 319, line 4: Ps. 19, 5. is also nota 
citation; neither is the fifth passage, p.339, line 6: 
2 Sam. 23, 6. With these marginal notes, 
especially the more remote and more difficult to 
recognize Scriptures should have been cited. 





The author intended to take into account the 
citations in the 13th volume, p. XXXVI, so that he 
would be able to prove his assurance: "The 
scriptural citations, not allusions to scriptural 
passages, have been proven, only in the case of 
frequent recurrence of the same passage this was 
omitted. But this has not been fulfilled. In the case 
of the passage from Ephesians, there is no direct 
citation, but Eph. 6, 17. is noted in the margin. In 
Hosea, as it appears from the Weimar edition, 
there is an undoubted citation, but nothing given in 
the margin. We have now endeavored to discover 
the passage in question in Hosea; -first with the 
help of the Concordance; but in vain. Then we 
searched Hosea, first in the German Bible, then in 
the Vulgate, but without success. So, after much 
trouble and work and loss of time, we finally had to 
decide to move on without having solved the 
problem. But behold, at the next step we took, we 
realized that this was not a quotation from Hosea, 
but a part of the next keyword! Thus, on twenty- 
four pages of the Weimar edition, we find only five 
scriptural passages in the margin, of which two are 
incorrect and three are unnecessary. Now one 
would like to object: Perhaps in this designated 
space there was no opportunity for the introduction 
of real scriptural quotations. We answer this by 
referring to the direct citations, which the Weimar 
edition itself has made recognizable by acolon. S. 
318, Z. 35 should be in the margin: Luc. 24, 47.; p. 
318, Z. 40: Rom. 1, 16.; p. 322, Z. 24: Hoh. 16, 21.; 
p. 323, line 7: Ps. 54, 9.; p. 323, line 10: Ps. 137, 
7.; p. 325, line 8: Ps. 90, 1.; p. 325, line 11: Joh.

line 38: Ps. 38, 7; p. 337, line 22: Deut. 32, 32; p. 
337, line 30: Isa. 5, 2; p. 338, line 18: Matt. 7, 15;

21: Ps. 54, 9. p. 340, line 35: Proverbs 8, 27. Here 
we have thirty-six Scripture quotations. Although 
most of these are only additions to the number of 
verses, since the chapters are given correctly in 
the original, and in the case of the Psalms also the 
change of the counting of the Vulgate to that of our 
Bible, this work would still have been worthwhile, 
because it saves the reader from searching. 
However, not only in the case of direct citations is 
a scriptural reference very desirable, but also in 
many other cases, e.g. where it is a historical fact 
that is referred to (p. 317, line 24, Jer. 32, 7. ff. 
would have been appropriate), a doctrine, a 
custom, the correct understanding of a word, or 
whatever else may occur. If the editor of the 13th 
volume of the Weimar edition had not let this 
trouble spoil his work, and had done his best to 
follow the good example of the Weimar edition, he 
would have been able to find a solution. 


If he had followed the same form that he had in 
other volumes of the Weimar edition, he would 
have been spared many an error. This is already 
shown by the next error, which is found on p. 338, 
line 11: ut est in Numeris, for which one should 
read: ut est in Levitico [cap. 27, 28. sq.] Thus, it 
would not have been inappropriate to explain the 
words on p. 338, line 32: psalmus, qui est de 
antichristo by the marginal gloss: Ps. 10. 

Now we turn to the Zwickau manuscript on 
Micah. P. 260, line 24 is to be read Babyloniorum 
instead of Assyriorum. - P. 261, line 8 is to be read 
Hieremia instead of Ezechiele, and line 9 is to be 
read Ezechiele instead of Hieremia. - P. 261, Z. 14 
in the margin is to be read Luc. 3, 4. instead of Luc. 
4, 17. which also offers the Erlanger, because it 
depends on the word sermones, which is not found 
in the latter place. - S. 262, Z. 7 the verse number 
"4." should stand before rumpentur. - S. 262, Z. 10 
(Cap. 1, 4.) should be read inimpe- dibiliter instead 
of impedibiliter. - P. 263, line 2 (Cap. 1, 7.) is to be 
read with the Altenburg handwriting per instead of 
in. - S. 264, line 1 (Cap. 1, 8.) has the Weimar 
edition (as well as the Erlangen): p. 264, line 8 
(Cap. 1, 9.) is to be read Babylonica instead of 
Assyriaca. - p. 264, line 8 should read pavore 
vicinae captivitatis instead of pavore  vicino 
captivitati. - p. 264, line 11 is to read mali ftatt male. 
- P. 264, Z. 29 (Cap. 1, 10.) is to read latete, [nolite] 
palam flere instead of latere, palam flere.... - p. 
266, Z. 5 (Cap. 1, 12.) is to be read accipiet instead 
of incipiet according to the Vulgate - p. 266, Z. 15 
(Cap. 1, 13.) is to be read (according to Joshua 19, 
47.) Lesem instead of Lastum. - S. 267, Z. 19 (Cap. 
1, 15.) is (according to the Hana-.

The text in the Weimar edition is written ieres 
instead of Such incorrect and therefore quite 
useless renderings of Hebrew words are 
encountered frequently. - P. 268, line 16 (Cap. 2, 
1.) is to be read meditatus est instead of 
meditamini. Both the Erlanger and_ the 
Weimarsche have added medi incorrectly and 
highlighted it as a keyword, while it belongs to the 
broader interpretation of Ps. 36, 6. (according to 
the Vulgate). - P. 268, line 17 is to be read 
nunquam instead of iniquitas, according to the 
Altenburg and Hall manuscripts. - S. 268, Z. 26 
(Cap. 2, 1.) we are commanded: Huc spectamus 
omnes clerici ut divites fiamus et bene pasti. It 
would be inconsistent to put this into Luther's 
mouth, so we have assumed spectant and fiant 
instead of spectamus and fiamus in the Hall 
manuscript. - S. 269, Z. 27 (Cap. 2, 4.) we find 
Schebed instead of and immediately following 
adjectivo instead of adverbio. - S. 270, Z. 9 (Cap. 
2, 6.) we find the (by false jnterpunction)'unrhymed 
sentence: "Ecclesia: ubi est adhuc verbum Dei?" 
When could ever the Church ask like that? It 
should read, [Coetus Domini est] ecclesia, ubi est 
adhuc verbum Dei. - S. 271, Z. 33 (Cap. 2, 11.) 
has the Weimar one in the margin: Hos. 12, 1. 
(likewise the Erlanger), but it should read Hos. 9, 
7. - S. 271, Z. 9 (Cap. 2, 8.) lacks the word 
adversarius after meus. - On p. 272, line 28 (Cap. 
2, 12.) the Weimar version (as _ well as the 
Erlanger) says in the margin: "Col. 1, 13." But it 
should be Col. 1, 23. Obviously, "Col. 1, 13." in the 
Erlangen edition is a misprint, which the Weimar 
edition has taken over without looking it up. Since 
it now repeatedly occurs that the Weimar edition 





has cited the same _ inapplicable scriptural 
passages in the margins as the Erlangen edition, 
it is reasonable to assume that the Weimar edition 
has blindly followed the Erlangen edition, even in 
the few scriptural passages it has cited, in order to 
save itself the often great (and yet sometimes 
unsuccessful) effort of searching, Z.32 (Cap. 2, 
12.) should read instead of dabar - S. 273, Z. 12 
(Cap. 2, 13.) should read impediunt instead of 
impendunt. - S. 273, Z. 21 is to be read semper 
instead of saepe, because our duke and head 
does not alone often go before us to overcome 
death 2c., but always. - P. 274, line 16 the verse 
number "6." should have been placed before 
Contra. - P. 274, Z. 28 (Cap. 3, 6.) is to be read 
Ezechiam instead of Hiere- miam. This error would 
not have remained unnoticed if the passage in 
Jeremiah had been consulted. For from (Jer. 26, 
18.) one would have recognized the correct 
reading, although the words sicut est in 3. Regum 
(that is 1 Kings 22, 24.) mislead, since our prophet 
is confused with Micah, the son of Jemla (1 Kings 
22, 9.), who lived about two hundred years before 
Micah of Maresa. This error, however, is not 
attributable to Luther, but to the scribe who omitted 
that the behavior of Zedekiah against Micah of 
Jemla was cited as an example of how shamefully 
the prophets were treated. This is shown in the 
Hall manuscript. - S. 276, Z. 6 (Cap. 3, 6.) is to be 
read eorum instead of suum. - On p. 276, line 21 
(Cap. 3, 7.) ut is to be deleted because it is too 
much. - On p. 279, line 23 (Cap. 4, 6.) read sit 
instead of in; in the same line, put a period before 
si. - P. 279, Z. 29 (Cap. 4, 6.) should be read sic 
hic ftatt dic, hic 2c. - S. 280, Z. 17 it would have 
been well ge-.

The words without the addition of arx legis are 
misunderstandable. - S. 280, Z. 22 (Cap. 4, 8.) is 
to be read: ubinam habitant etiam homines instead 
of ubi non. For where men do not dwell, the gospel 
cannot progress and reign. Immediately after it is 
to be added before locum obscurum: Significat 
Eder. - S. 282, Z. 12 (Cap. 4, 13.) is to be read: 
Ferrum, aes, instead of: P. 282, Z. 17 (Cap. 4, 13.) 
Domino is to be inserted before universae terrae. 
- S. 282, Z. 25 (Cap. 4, 14.) reads in the original: 
Sic in- terpre, which the Erlanger and the 
Weimarsche have added thus: Sic 
interpretandum. But in this way a contradiction 
occurs against the following interpretation, that by 
filia latronis ["warrior woman"] Babylon is to be 
understood. Therefore, we have assumed 
interpretatum (that is, so it has been interpreted). 
Immediately following, to give sense, we have 
assumed  cohaerentia twice’ instead _ of 
controversia, according to the Altenburg 
manuscript. - On p. 283, line 4, belli is to be read 
instead of bellis. The word is taken from a verse of 
Virgil (Aen. |, 14). - On p. 283, line 10 (Cap. 4, 14.) 
in the keyword either judicis or judicum is to be 
read instead of judicii. - P. 285, Z. 13 (Cap. 5, 3.) 
Esfaia] 11[, 2.] is to be read instead of x8. 2 - 
Neither the Erlangen nor the Weimar edition has 
recognized that p. 287, line 2 (Cap. 5, 6.) quae is 
a new keyword, but it is there in direct connection 
with the preceding (ros, quae), which neither gives 
a right sense, nor is permissible according to 
grammar. - S. 287, Z. 6 (Cap. 5, 6.) the 
Weimarsche has as well as the Erlanger in the 
margin Ps. 103, 16. instead of Ps. 72, 16. Because 
the 





Weimarsche has not looked up, or perhaps also 
has not found the correct place, so the same 
expresses its surprise about the correct citation of 
the place in the Hall manuscript: "et florebunt de 
civitate [?]." The Weimar edition has added this 
question mark in the notes p. 286, line 4 v. u.. - S. 
287, Z. 14 (Cap. 5, 7.) reads: Erit etc. Pecoribus 
pecorum omnium interibunt, eradicabuntur, sic 
etiam hoc de spiritu sancto apostoli et patres primi, 
qui fundamentum posuerunt, sumpti sunt de filiis 
Israel 2c. What might the editors of the Erlangen 
and Weimar editions have thought with this 
sentence, and how would they translate it into 
German? Here, the scribe of the manuscript has 
united through wrong writing, the decipherers of 
the manuscript through wrong reading, and the 
editors of the manuscript through wrong 
interpunging to produce this meaningless 
passage. Instead of Erit etc., according to the 
Vulgate, the keyword should have been: Et erunt 
etc. Then follow two word explanations, which 
Luther often anticipates; one to this verse, the 
other to the following verse, namely: Gregibus 
pecorum [i. e.] ovium. At (Gregibus Roth has 
mistaken, and instead, prompted by the following 
pecorum, has written: Pecoribus. The decipherers 
of the manuscript have read omnium out of ovium, 
which will be found in the manuscript, which has 
already happened to them once, as we have 
shown in the interpretation of the prophet Joel 
(Cap. 1, 18.) according to the Altenburg 
Hanoschrift. Also there we had (Weim. Ausg. Bd. 
XIll, p. 93, Z. 20) greges omnium instead of greges 
ovium. The second word explanation is: 


XIV 


Foreword. 





Interibunt [i. e.] eradicabuntur. Now follows the 
interpretation: Sic [sc. ut praecedens versus] etiam 
hoc de spiritu sancto [dictum est]. Apostoli et 
patres primi etc. - p. 287, line 21 is to be read 
diripuit instead of diripiunt. - p. 287, line 4 v. u. is 
to be read sortilegos instead of sacrilegos in the 
Hall manuscript..- p. 288, line 3 f. (Cap. 5, 9.) is to 
be read: tanquam nihil habentes instead of nihil 
habentes tanquam. - p. 288, Z. 6 (Cap. 5, 9.) is to 
be read: non egebis quadrigis, non verbo 
[humano] 2c. The original reads egeb, which is 
supplemented by the editions, not well, to egebitis. 
- P. 288, line 25 (Cap. 5, 12.) should be the first 
stitch word: [Non] ultra, not evellam, which here 
the Weimar edition has put instead of vetra 
(probably read from vitra) in the Erlanger; and as 
the second stitch word after Et should be inserted 
evellam, whose explanation is destruam. The 
verse number "13th" should be placed before Et 
evellam. P. 289, Z. 29 (Cap. 6, 5.) should be read 
robur or vires instead of verbum. - P. 290, Z. 1 
(Cap. 6, 5.) Gilgal is to be read instead of Gilead. - 
S. 290, Z. 9 we find the words: ,,cultum, quo 
praeveniam dominum." appended to v. 5. But it 
closes the interpretation of the fifth verse with the 
word oultuiu. The following should have been 
drawn to the following paragrapns as an 
explanation of the first words of the 6th verse: Quid 
dignum offeram Domino? This error is all the more 
disconcerting because on the same page in the 
Hallic manuscript it is offered: Quid, Heb. quo 
praeveniam dominum? (The question mark is 
added by us.) - p. 290, Z. 25 (Cap. 6, 8.) is written 
as keyword: Judicabo instead of Indicabo. "This is 
not a typographical error, because also the. 





Erlanger reads like this. - S. 291, Z. 7 (Cap. 6, 8.) 
we read: Non sacerdotum est docere, scribere. 
Who would like to sign that the priests should 
neither teach nor write? The context requires that 
it be added thus: Non [solum] sacerdotum est 
docere, scribere, oportet [eos] opere adimplere, 
ideo dicit ,,facere" etc. - S. 291, Z. 15 (Cap. 6, 8.) 
is suitably: Secundo eingefcpoben bor: ut diligas 
misericordiam, which in our original is separated 
from the preceding only by acomma. - S. 292, line 
1 (Cap. 6, 8.) we even read: indamnabile vitium. 
Which vice is "indamnabile"? If the manuscript is 
correct, we will probably find indomabile vitium, an 
indomitable vice, which is also indicated by the 
similes of the thistle head, which always stands 
upright, and (in the Altenburg manuscript) of the 
onion, which always has one skin under the other.- 
But a few lines later, p. 292-, line 7, it seems as if 
Luther -for with whose most just interpretation we 
are dealing here, as in the acrius examinata editio 
(namely, this is what the Erlangen Exeg. opp., 
tom. XXV, x. 129), because in the 24th volume p. 
4 it says: Res ita se habet, ut . . . commentarius 
Cygnensis a Rothio descriptus opus ywnowtatov 
sit aestimandus - really has such an unpardonable 
vice statuirt, namely the xenodochia (the 
hospitality), against which, however, one has to 
fight like against the philautia (the selfishness). Of 
course, such nonsense is far from Luther's mind. 
Instead of xenodochia, rather xEvo%a, (vain 


honor) is to be read. May now also at least the 
xenodochia be on Roth's account 


Foreword. 


the decipherers of the manuscript and the editors 
of the same should certainly have objected to this. 
- P. 294, line 5 (Cap. 6, 16.) is to be read quia 
instead of quis. - On p. 294, line 6 (Cap. 6, 16.), 
the word per should be replaced by pater. In the 
next line, voluptatibus seems to us to be either an 
auditory or a typographical error on Roth's part, for 
the Vulgate reads voluntatibus. Therefore, here 
the Hallic manuscript offers: Voluptatibus, potius: 
voluntatibus. - S. 294, Z. 17 (Cap. 7, 1.) we read: 
in Ozea simile verbum 2c. This passage has given 
us almost as much trouble as the above 
mentioned alleged citation from Hosea (in the 
Altenburg manuscript Cap. 7, 2.). For instead of in 
Ozea it is to be read: in Amos [cap. 8, 1. sq]. - S. 
295, Z. 29 (Cap. 7, 4.) the word terra is to be 
inserted at the end of the line. - P. 295, Z. 32 (Cap. 
7, 4.) is to be put instead of Aven. - P. 297, line 6 
(Cap. 7, 11.) is Psalmus in the text (Erlanger: p8.) 
and in both editions in the margin: Ps. 104, 9. But 
instead of it Prov. [8, 29.] is to be read. This 
passage is quoted here literally. Another thing that 
speaks against the Psalm passage is that the word 
lex, which is important here, is not found in it. - S. 
298, Z. 25 (Cap. 7, 19.) stands in the original fa, 
which both the Erlanger and the Weimarsche have 
(not well) added to faciant. It should be read faciet. 
The subject to this is God: he will make 
consciences entirely free. In the faciant reading, 
the sins would have to be set as the subject. But 
of these it could hardly be said, "that they shall 
make consciences wholly free". 
In Nahum after the Altenburg hand 
writing is p. 374, line 27 (Cap. 1, 3.) instead: 


XV 


non nocentabit to read: non innocentabit. This is 
confirmed by the Zwickau manuscript. - S. 375, 
line 14 (Cap. 1, 4.) is to be read adducere instead 
of abducere. - On p. 376, line 24 (Cap. 1, 8.) the 
passage Is. 28, 18. is read like this: Flagellum 
inundans cum transierit, non veniet super nos. 
The Vulgate reads: Flagellum inundans cum 
transierit, eritis ei in conculcationem. Luther 
translated thus, "If a flood comes along, it will 
crush you." Accordingly, instead of: non veniet 
super vos, it will read: veniet super vos. It is 
remarkable that the Zwickau manuscript at the 
corresponding place (p. 351, Z. 2.) brings exactly 
the same wording. We can see that both the 
Altenburg and the Zwickau editions have used 
one and the same source, in which the scriptural 
word cited by Luther has been turned into its 
straight opposite out of misunderstanding. 
Luther's intention with this quotation was only to 
prove that the Hebrew expression: "A flood is 
coming" is also found in other places. - An equally 
inverted citation is found on p. 377, line 9 [Cap.1, 
8.). There Prov. 31, 18. (not ? Proverb. 28, which 
the Weimar one offers): non extinguetur in nocte 
lucerna ejus is cited as the scriptural passage with 
which Luther wanted to prove that "light" in 
Scripture means as much as well-being. However, 
this passage does not prove that, but lucerna is 
there "a light", with which a diligent woman also 
works at night. Luther did not quote this passage 
at all, but, as we see from the Zwickau manuscript, 
Prov. 13, 9: Lucerna impiorum extinguetur. - P. 
377, Z. 16 (Cap. 1, 9.) is instead of comminatione 
To read comminationis, which is likewise 


XVIV 


is confirmed by the Zwickau manuscript. - P. 379, 
line 4 (Cap. 1, 11.) is to be read structores instead 
of destructores, 

as is evident from Isa. 49, 17. - S. 390, line 28 
(Cap. 3, 11.) is to be read instead of venite: 
vomite, as Jer. 25, 27. proves. - In Nahum 
according to the Zwickau manuscript there are 
only a few errors. S. 351, Z. 6 (Cap. 1, 8.) is in the 
original in prover, which the Weimar edition has 
added thus: in prover [bio], but in the margin (as 
well as the Erlangen) has cited Jes. 57, 20. We 
think that it should be read in proverbiis, namely 
Prov. 10, 25, which the Altenburg manuscript also 
offers. Against the passage of Isaiah speaks 
especially that pertransire does not stand in the 
same, what is important here. - S. 352, Z. 9 (Cap. 
1, 10.) is instead of the second sicut to read sic. - 
S. 355, Z. 26 (at the end of the first chapter) is 
instead of Esa. 5. is to be read Esa. 25, 8. - p. 358, 
line 15 (Cap. 2, 6.) is to be read regia [the royal 
castle] instead of regio. This is not a misprint, for 
the Erlanger also reads this way. - On the same 
page, the Hall manuscript reads irrigua instead of 
arrigua. - S. 363, Z. 12 (Cap. 3, 4.) is instead of 
Esa. 51. is to be read Esa. 52. and in the following 
line instead of 3. reg. 27 read 3. reg. 21, 25. - p. 
365, line 3 (Cap. 3, 8.) reads quae habitat. The 
marginal gloss to this (in the notes, line 8 v. 0.) 
reads in the Weimar: vel quaesita est instead of: 
quae sita est. This is not a printing error, because 
the Erlangen also reads this way. 

We have determined the time when Luther's 
interpretation of the prophet Habakkuk first 
appeared more precisely than has been done so 
far. See the first note to this writing. - In the 
interpretation of this prophet according to the 
Altenburg manuscript, in the Wei 


Foreword. 


The following errors have been corrected by us in 
the first edition of St. Mark's: p. 424, line 24 (Cap. 
1, 2.) we have put mihi instead of mea. - On p. 426, 
line 23 (Cap. 1, 5.) we have accepted the remark 
of the Erlanger that quod daselbst mangele as 
correct. The Weimar one, however, which thought 
it could be done without this quod, had it printed 
that way: Hic est me mo- yet, and thereby 
burdened Luther with a completely inconsistent 
conclusion. - S. 429, line 7, (Cap. 1, 12.) is to be 
read autem instead of antea. - On p. 432, line 26 
(Cap. 2, 2.) Gabrielem is to be read instead of 
Michaelem. 

- P. 444, line 40 (Cap. 3, 8.) is to be read flumen 
instead of lumen. The latter is not a printing error, 
because also the Erlanger reads so. - In the 
interpretation of Habakkuk according to the 
Zwickau manuscript we note the following: S. 396, 
Z. 20 (Cap. 1, 1.) is to be read Hieronymus instead 
of Hieremias. - P. 397, line 21 (Cap. 1, 4.) is to be 
read instead of: non prodit: pro- pterea prodit. By 
mistake, the scribe has confused the first place in 
this verse: non prodit judicium ad finem with the 
second: propterea prodit judicium tortuosum, 
which could easily have happened in the hurry of 
scribbling. The editors, however, should have 
corrected this error, which offers the exact 
opposite of the correct meaning. - S. 400, Z. 7 
(Cap. 1, 9.) the Weimar already has the verse 
number "10.", while it should only be Z. 13. - S. 
400, Z. 21 (Cap. 1, 10.) is to be read munita 
instead of immunita. - On p. 404, line 31 (Cap. 2, 
3.) the verse number "3." is to be placed before 
quoniam, while on p. 405, line 5 is to be deleted. 
In addition, there is a very confusing jnterpunstion 
in the quoted passage. - On p. 407, line 8 (Cap. 2, 
6.) Gi is to be read instead of tidi. - P. 408, line 3 v. 
u. in the notes (Cap. 2, 10.) is instead of 


Foreword.

in the notes (Cap. 2, 16.) is to be read Babylonius 
instead of Assyrius. - S. 412, line 12 (Cap. 2, 20.) 
is to be read instead of: ibi cessabunt sculptilia 
jactantia: ibi cessabit sculptilium jactantia. - S. 412, 
Z. 24 (Cap. 3, 1.) is instead of ignoravit to read 
ignorabit; Z. 25 instead of confidentiam to read 
conscientiam; Z. 26 instead of aptius to read 
captis. - S. 413, Z. 1 (Cap. 3, 2.) is instead of 
exhibenda To read exhibita; Z. 2 instead of 
specialius to read specialia. - S. 413, Z. 22 (Cap. 
3, 2.) is to be read consumptum instead of 
sepultum according to the Vulgate. - S. 414, line 
10 (Cap. 3, 3.) is to be read ab austro instead of 
ab alto. - S. 415, line 30 (Cap. 3, 6.) is to be read 
according to the Vulgate fugiamus Israelem 
instead of fugere Israel. - p. 416, line 31 (Cap. 3, 


7.) is to be read XXXXX instead of Ragas - p. 417, 
line 30 (Cap. 3, 9.) is to be read regnum instead of 
regum. - P. 418, Z. 6 (Cap. 3, 9.) is instead of meis 
to read tuis; instead of Seon to read Og. - P. 418, 
Z. 10 (Cap. 3, 9.) is instead of "statio' cumillis" to 
read zik: (sentio cum illis). - S. 418, Z. 26 (Cap. 3,

read sublimia. - On p. 419, line 32 (Cap. 3, 13.)

In Zephaniah according to the Altenburg 
manuscript, p. 489, line 18 (Cap. 1, 13.) is to be 
read allevarentur instead of elevarentur (Vulg. Ps. 
73, 18.). - On p. 498, line 12 (Cap. 2, 14.) 
Babylonios is to be read instead of Assyrios. - p. 
501, line 19 (Cap. 3, 4.) is to be read justiciarius 
instead of judiciarius. - In the Zwickau manuscript 
on Zephaniah, p. 454, line 5 (Cap. 1, 14.) the verse 
number "14." is to be put, not first line 17: - Ibid. 





Z. 5 is to be read prope (Vulg. juxta) instead of 
proper. This is not a typographical error, for the 
Erlangen edition also reads this way. - Ibid. Z. 6, a 
solum is to be inserted after the first non. Without 
this addition, the sentence is meaningless. - Ibid. 
Z. 8 is to be read dimidiant instead of divinant (Ps. 
55, 24. Vulg.: dimidiant). - P. 460, Z. 4 stands the 
verse number "16." but should be placed before 
Clangoris only Z. 5. Similarly, line 11 contains the 
verse number "17.", but it should not be placed 
before Et tribulabo until line 12. - S. 461, line 1 
(Cap. 1, 17.) must, in order to make sense, be 
followed by a dot after facient and then by Sanguis. 
Similarly, in line 19, evadere is to be inserted after 
justitiis. - p. 466, line 2, the verse number (Cap. 2,) 
should be "12.", not first line 12. -- p. 467, line 7 
(Cap. 2, 15.) is in the original: glo Ninive, which 
both the Erlanger and the Weimarsche have 
rendered by gloria Ninive. But it should be read 
gloriosa. - P. 468, line 15 (Cap. 3, 2.) should be 
read non instead of suo. The verse number "2." 
should have been placed Z. 14. - S. 470, Z. 1 (Cap. 
3, 5.) we read: sed perrumpet Christus et 
agnoscent iniquitatem ignominiae ut de domino:

manuscripts attest: sed perrump et Christus. Etnon 
agnoscet iniquitatem ignominiae. Ut de Domino

read Filii dispersorum. - S. 474, line 7 (Cap. 3, 11.) 
will be read ernt instead of erit. - P. 474, lines 18 
f. (Cap. 3, 12.) is wrongly interpointed: et reliquias 
Israel, adipem populi, tollam electos et magnos 
2c. It should be: et reliquias Israel. Adipem populi 
tollam, electos et magnos 2c. - S. 475, Z. 31 (Cap. 
3, 15.) is to be added after fert either inimicos, or 
it must be read in Z. 32 castigari instead of 
castigare. - p. 476, line 9 (Cap. 3, 16.) is to be 
resolved by praesentem in the original, which the 
Hall manuscript offers, not by patrem, as it was 
done in the Erlanger and in the Weimar edition. - 
P. 477, line 3 (Cap. 3, 17.) is to be read in domino 
instead of in mundo. Likewise, line 11 should be 
read sua instead of sui. Z. 14 is to be read 
exultabit instead of exaltabit according to the 
Altenburg and Hall manuscripts. - P. 477, line 23 
(Cap. 3, 18.) is to be read fecit instead of facit. p. 
478, line 1 (Cap. 3, 18.) is to be read Aravissima 
instead of rarissima. - P. 479, Z. 20 (Cap. 3, 20.) 
is to be read universalem instead of vilem 
according to the Altenburg manuscript. - In 
addition, we have inserted several keywords that 
are necessary but missing in the editions. 

In the interpretation of the prophet Haggai 
according to the Altenburg manuscript, p. 533, line 
19 (in the second part of the preface) is to be read 
tantnm instead of landein, because the word of 
God is not "also finally" received by the weak, 
oppressed and poor, but "also only" by them. The 
reading landein will be based on a hearing error. - 
P. 538, Z. 24 f. (Cap. 1, 13.) is continued after the 
saying: "If God is for us, who may be against us?": 
nonminus nobis nocere poterit hostis quicunque 





quam ut deo non potest nocere. We have 
assumed instead: multo minus nobis nocere 
poterit hostis quisquam, ut Deo 2c. - S. 539, Z. 12 
f. (Cap. 2, 1.) we are commanded: Videtur 
discrepantia esse, in octo scii, dierum distantia. 
This seems to us to make no sense, so we have 
assumed (according to the Hall manuscript, which 
offers: Supra dictum): Videtur discrepantia esse in 
dicto, scil. etc. - p. 541, Z. 42 (Cap. 2, 9.) instead 
of exivit, according to the Vulgate, is to be read 
exibit..- p. 544, Z. 5 (Cap. 2, 19.) instead of mense 
primo is to be read mense sexto die primo. - 
Furthermore, in this relation, as usual, a whole 
number of verse numbers are missing in the 
Weimar edition. - In the Zwickau manuscript p. 
512, line 14, we seem to be missing a non: "Thus 
the promise by which he [Cyrus] gave them 
permission [ to rebuild Jerusalem] does not seem 
to have been kept, because nothing was 
accomplished except that they returned to Judea." 
- S. 513, Z. 31 (Cap. 1, 2.) is to be read volunt 
instead of vult. In the original it is only v. d., which 
the editions have wrongly resolved by vult dicere 
instead of volunt dicere. Already the biblical text 
shows that these are not words of God or the 
prophet, but of the people, as is also expressed in 
the immediately preceding: repetit verba populi. 
For the same reason I. 0. Z. 33 is to be read ut 
reaedificetur [per nos] templum instead of ut 
reaedificetis templum. - p. 513, line 4 v. u. is to be 
read in the Hall manuscript instead of resistere as 
desistere, and in the following line instead of 
resistas as desistas. - p. 514, line 19 (Cap. 1, 4.) 
instead of mala is to be read millia after Ps. 3, 7. - 
p. 520, line 20 (Cap. 2, 1.) instead of conferre is to 
be read confortare. - 


Foreword. 


xix 





P. 522, Z. 4 will be creavit instead of crevit 
(according to the context). - Idid. Z. 5 have the 
issues: Repetit eundem sermonem angelus etc. 
But it is to be interpung thus: Repetit eundem 
sermonem [cap. 1, 13.] : Angelus etc. - p. 522, Z. 
7 (Cap. 2, 5.) we read: Tureis dabo ego deus 
gentes, robustior sum illis. Instead of Tureis we 
read Territis (you, who are frightened]. In the 
Altenburg manuscript: si timetis. - S. 523, Z. 14 
(Cap. 2, 7.) offers our original: Si textus [scii, 


prophetae] on esset verus. - Ibid. Z. 18 is to be 
read venerit instead of veniret, for Luther says: "It 
follows inevitably that Christ has come, or the 
prophet is lying, which is impossible." - S. 523, Z. 
27 (Cap. 2, 7.) the Weimar edition has in the 
margin "Dan. 7, 27.", but it should be Dan. 9, 25. 
P. 524, line 7 (Cap. 2, 8.) should be read illal 
instead of alia. - P. 525, line 21 (Cap. 2, 8.) should 
read ubi instead of vel. - p. 527, line 11 (Cap. 2, 
11.) is to be read opus instead of qui, and the 
comma after festinetis is to be deleted. - On p. 527, 
line 19, instead of carnem read panem (according 
to the text of the Bible). - P. 527, Z. 30 f. (Cap. 2, 
14.) are several impulses. First, we read: 
"Respondetur sic." It should read: Respondetur: 
Sic (i.e. Yes]. After that, after neque should be 
added: pollueretur homo. Instead of the first 
immundum, immundum should be read; and in the 
following, instead of immunda, munda should be 
read, which the Altenburg manuscript confirms: 
"By nature everything is pure" 2c. - S. 529, line 8 
(Cap. 2, 15.) will be read credunt instead of credo. 
Without this or a similar alteration, the sentence is 
meaningless: Promisi me adhaerere suis lateribus, 
hoc non credo. - Ibid. Z. 11 





offers our template: Sic hac similitudine idem 
significat factis multa non curo, quia sunt minima 
legis. Instead of factis, facitis should be read and 
thus interpungited: Sic hac similitudine idem 
significat: facitis multa. Non curo, quia sunt minima 
legis. - The verse number "16." and the keyword: 
Et nunc ponite should have preceded p. 529, line 
14: Repetit idem should have been placed, as in 
the Altenburg manuscript. But this is already found 
on p. 528, line 24, where it is to be deleted. - S. 
529, Z. 16 we are commanded: Ex damno eorum 
vultis eorum oculos aperire. Instead of vultis, vult 
is to be read. Through their harm he wants to open 
their eyes. - Idid. P. 529, Z. 23 (Cap. 2, 18.) will be 
read Tam instead of Jam. - S. 529, Z. 29 has the 


| Weimar edition in the margin 5 Mos. 32, 24. but it 


should be put 5 Mos. 28, 22. - S. 531, Z. 5 we read 
(in the last line of this interpretation): ne videretur 
deus penitus Judaeos contempsisse ut Paulum, 
etc. Such hair-raising sayings should have been 
eliminated by suitable additions. Here like this: so 
that it does not seem as if God has completely 
despised the Jews, (but he has accepted some] 
like Paul 2c. 

The last text that we have shared from the latest 
discoveries is the interpretation of the prophet 
Zechariah according to the Altenburg manuscript. 
Although the Weimar edition has "read the 
manuscript better in many places" than the 
Erlangen edition, we have also had the opportunity 
to make significant improvements in several 
places to the text of the Weimar edition, which is 
generally very good. P. 547, line 13 (Preface) 


XX 


Foreword. 





either non is to be deleted or instead of non enim 
is to be read. Otherwise the sense of the sentence 
runs completely contrary to the context. - S. 549, 
Z. 11 (Cap. 1, 2.) is to be read instead of Matth. 
22: Luc. 14, 18. 8”. - p. 556, line 6 (Cap. 1, 8.) is 
to be read instead of cum signis verba: cum 
verbis signa, which also the Zwickau manuscript 
offers. - S. 560, line 6 (Cap. 1, 12.) is to be read 
instead of expositionis with the Zwickau 
manuscript consolationis. - S. 569, Z. 21 (Cap. 2, 
5.) is to be read instead of suos: suae; likewise S. 
570, Z. 1 instead of Item Zu lesen: Idem and Z. 6 
instead of videre to read: videri. - S. 588, Z. 7 
(Cap. 4, 6.) instead of propheticis will be read: 
prophetis. - 

On p. 594, line 25 (Cap. 4, 14.) the word 
splendoris, which is the explanatory word for oloi, 
is erroneously included in the keyword. - On p. 
595, line 4, instead of item, it should be read: 
idem, as the Zwickau manuscript also indicates. - 
On p. 596, line 24 (Cap. 5, 2. ) instead of hunc 
should be read: hanc, referring to porticus. - P. 
598, Z. 40 (Cap. 5, 7.) instead of auri is to be read: 
plumbi. -S. 599, line 14 (Cap. 5, 8.) instead of 
nobis quoque accidet contemptoribus evangelii 
we have assumed nostris etc., because we do not 
consider it credible that Luther had joined with the 
despisers of the Evangelii. - On p. 600, line 21 
(Cap. 5, 11.), instead of versionis, read: visionis. - 
On p. 606, line 3 (Cap. 6, 8), instead of vitro, which 
makes no sense, nitro should be read. - S. 607, 
line 12 (Cap. 6, 10.) is to be read instead of arcam 
(ark): arcum [rainbow], because not the ark but the 
rainbow was the sign for Noah (Gen. 9, 13.). - S. 
608, Z. 35 (Cap. 6, 13.) is to be read in Numeris 
[cap. 27, 20.] instead of Deuteron. - P. 610, last 
line of the sixth. 





In the first chapter, instead of intricabili, read 
inextricabili. - On p. 612, line 10 (preface to Cap. 


7), instead of Esaiam, read Hieremiam (Cap. 39- 
44). The Weimar edition has the note: "Should 


Luther look at Esa. 30and the Assyrians instead 


of stopping at Jerem. 39-41? In the margin of the 
manuscript is Esa. 30," but yet did not dare to 
change. - S. 614, Z. 41 (Cap. 7, 12.) is to be read 
instead of Esaia: Hosea 16, 5]. - S. 615, Z. 21 
(Cap. 7, 14.) is to be read instead of Genesi: 
Aggeo (2, 8.). - p. 617, line 1 (Cap. 8, 3.) instead 
of templum is to be read: in templo; perhaps 
versus after templum may have fallen out. In any 
case, however, what the text offers cannot exist: 
cum templum adorarent. - S. 621, Z. 12 (Cap. 8, 
20.) is to be read instead of Actor. 1 is to be read: 
Actor. 2, 5. - S. 623, Z. 13 (Cap. 9, 1.) offers 
instead of Weimar's Kadrach: Hadrach. This 
is not a misprint, for the Erlanger also reads thus. 
- S. 630, line 20 (Cap. 9, 12.) will be read with the 
Erlanger instead of ut: et. - The carelessness in 
setting the verse numbers, which shows itself 
throughout the thirteenth volume of the Weimar 
edition, as we have demonstrated several times, 
reaches an incredible height in the tenth chapter 
of Zechariah. Of the twelve verse numbers of this 
chapter, only one, the verse number "2.", is 
impeccably placed. Five are not set at all, namely 
1. 8.9. 10. 12. Six are in an incorrect place: 3. 4. 
5. 6. 7. 11. The last two are set twice; once in the 
wrong place, once correctly. Where "12." should 
stand, we find the verse number "13.", which does 
not exist. - P. 643, Z. 15 (Cap. 10, 10.) is to be 
read in the margin§ instead of Joh. 4, 23: Joh. 4, 
21. - p. 643, line 23 (Cap. 10, 11.) is instead of 
sonus according to the Vulgate sonum 


Foreword. 


Xxi 





to be read; likewise line 30 to be read instead of 
Kleine: Assur. - p. 647, line 7 (Cap. 11, 7.) both the 
Erlangen and the Weimar editions have 
incorporated a citation (namely Cap. 11, 13.), 
which still belongs to the previous section, into the 
following keyword (from v. 7.)! - P. 649, line 2 
(Cap. 11, 10.) is to be read instead of priorum: 
piorum. - P. 649, Z. 39 (Cap. 11, 13.) is to be read 
instead of in Esaia: in Psalmo (103, 14.]; likewise 
in the following line instead of Hieremiam: 
Ecclesiasticum [33, 13th]. - S. 653, Z. 32 (Cap. 12, 
1.) instead of cogantur will be read cogitent, 
because it is not permissible that the ungodly are 
"forced" to destroy the faithful. - S. 654, Z. 33 (Cap. 
12, 2.) is instead of Esa. 29 is to be read: Esa. 51, 
17; similarly, in line 35, in the margin, instead of 
Ps. 59, 5. read Ps. 60, 5. - As a curiosity, we 
mention that p. 656, line 23 (Cap. 12, 5.) in this 
one line seven necessary commas are missing, for 
we read: Ita crux sanguis tyranni violentia carceres 
mala mors persecutio, omnia illa etc- p. 659, line 
1 (Cap. 12, 8.) the citation from 2 Sam. 12, 13: 
Dominus transtulit peccatum, which belongs to the 
previous section, is highlighted as a keyword. This 
is nu,r made possible by the fact that the editors 
(also the Erlanger reads so) in the immediately 
preceding words: Statim enim subjicit propheta, 
under the prophet not Nathan, but the prophet 
Zechariah understood. - S. 664, line 40 (Cap. 13, 
4.) is to be read instead of Hieremiae Jesaiae (20, 
2.); immediately following in the saying instead of 
salve to be read: solve. - p. 667, line 36 (Cap. 13, 
8.) instead of Et erit according to the Vulgate Et. 
erunt should have been put as a keyword. - p. 668, 
line 3 (Cap. 13, 8.) 





is to be read instead of possumus: possemus. - S. 
668, Z. 28 (Cap. 13, 9.) is to be read instead of in 
Ozea: in Joele [3, 5.], because in Hosea such a 
place is not found. - S. 668, Z. 38 s. (Cap. 13, 9.) 
is to be read (according to Phil. 4, 6. in the Vulgate) 
instead of nihili solliciti etc. sed 2c.: nihil solliciti 
sitis, sed 2c. 

We have also been able to make some 
improvements in the interpretation of the prophet 
Malachi in the text printed in the editions after the 
Wittenberg. Cap. 2, 7. (Weim. Ausg. Bd. XIll, p. 
686, Z. 18) is to be read instead of perfecti either 
perplexi or with the Hallic manuscript indocti. For 
not "the perfect," but those in distress of 
conscience or unlearned, will inquire and desire 
the law and the will of God from the priests. - Cap. 
2, 8. (Weim. p. 687, Z. 7) is instead of repulistis 
according to Hof. 4, 6. is to be read: repulisti. - 
Cap. 3, 2. (p. 694, Z. 12) is to be followed by a 
question mark instead of a period after moritur. 
Ibid. Z. 21 the word humana is missing in the 
Weimar one. - Cap. 3, 3. (p. 695, Z. 14) instead of 
emendator is to be read emundator, for in the 
keyword is mundator; in the Vulgate: emundans. 
Ibid. Z. 22 is to be read instead of omnium 
according to 2 Tim. 3, 9.: omnibus. - Cap. 3, 5. (p. 
696, Z. 24) has the Weimar, probably reprinted 
from the Erlanger, superabuntur instead of the 
correct separabuntur in the Wittenberger. - Cap. 3, 
6. (p. 697, line 8) is to be read instead of ullus: ullis. 
A printing error. Similarly, Cap. 3, 8. (p. 698, Z. 4) 
will have failed due to a printing error tam.-Cap. 3, 
9. (p. 698, line 18) will have to read possessione 
instead of professione according to the context. In 
the Hall manuscript, the corresponding place is 
found: si multa 


XXII 


venerint in domum vestram. - Cap. 3, 13. (p. 699, 
line 13) is to be read instead of: cap. 3. a principio 
should be read: Cap. 2. in fine [v. 17.]. In the Hall 
manuscript it reads: In fine 3. cap.; instead of "3.", 
"2." should be put. Ibid. Z. 24 will read pullati 
instead of polluti with the Hallic manuscript. - Cap. 
4, 2. (p. 701, line 8) is to be read in mysterio 
instead of in ministerio, which the old translator 
already indicated.

has taken? - Moreover, as usual, many verse 
numbers are missing in the interpretation of this 
prophet. 

So now, with God's help, we have completed 
the difficult work of translating the prophets, and 
ask the dear Lord to place His blessing on it and 
to create some benefit from it, for the sake of 
Jesus Christ His dear Son, Amen.

1. Warning D. 


Mart. Luth.*) 


1545. 


St. Paul says: Avarice is the root of all evil. We 
experience such a saying in our shameful, evil time so 
powerfully as one does not find much of the same in all 
histories. 

For just look at the horrible, terrible nature and evil 
that avarice drives through the wretched usurer, thal 
even some fine, sensible, brave people are so possessed 
with this avarice devil and usury devil that they knowingly, 
and with a well-considered mind drive the recognized 
usury, and thus willingly and with good sense worship the 
idol Mammon, with great, horrible contempt for divine 
grace and wrath, and run and walk over it into the hellish 
fire and damnation seeing and hearing alike. 

This same cursed avarice, among all the other evils} 
that it drives, has also set about our work to practice its| 
malice and harm. For after the merciful God has given us 
His unspeakable grace here in Wittenberg, that we have 
brought "His" holy Word and the holy Biblia brightly and 
loudly into the German language, we have (as any 
reasonable person can well think) done great work (but 
all by God's grace): 

So avarice takes hold, and does to our printers this 
mischievousness and trickery, that others print soon 
after, and so the 





Robbing us of our work and food for their profit, which is 
a real, great, public robbery, which God will also punish, 
and which no honest Christian person would consider 
good. For my part, | have received it for nothing, | have 
given it for nothing, and | ask nothing in return. Christ, 
my Lord, has repaid me a hundred thousand times over. 

But | have to complain about the avarice, that the 
stingy guards and robber reprinters deal unfaithfully with 
our work. For because they seek only their avarice, they 
ask little about how rightly or wrongly they print it 
afterwards. And it has often happened to me that | have 
read the reprints and found them so falsified that | have 
not known my own work in many places and have had to 
improve it again. They make it rips raps; it is money, so 
[they] nevertheless (if they were otherwise right printers) 
well know and should have experienced that no 
diligence can be sufficient for such work as the printing 
press is, of which give me testimony who has ever tried 
what diligence belongs to it. 

Therefore, if anyone desires to have this newly 
improved Biblia for himself or for another library, he is 
hereby faithfully warned by me to see what and where 
he buys, and to take care of this printing, which is 
corrected by ours and

might run over the books again. Even if | had to live that 
long, | am now too weak for such work. 

And | wish that everyone would consider that no one 
else is easily as serious about the Biblia as we are here 
in Wittenberg, as we were the first to be given the grace 
to bring God's Word back to the day in an unadulterated 
and well-purified form. We also hope that our 
descendants will apply the same diligence in their 
reprinting, since 


And so we have faithfully and abundantly offered and 
shared it with all Christians without all avarice, benefit 
and enjoyment (which we can boast of in Christ). And 
what we have suffered, done, and applied to it, let no 
one know, for these are the gifts, and He who has 
wrought these things through us unworthy, wretched, 
poor instruments 1). To Him alone be glory, praise and 
thanksgiving forever and ever, amen.

2, preface from the Old Testament. *) 


(First published in 1523.) 


(1) Some think that the Old Testament was given 
to the Jewish people alone, and that it is now gone, 
and only writes about past stories; they think that 
they have enough in the New Testament, and 
pretend to look for spiritual meaning in the Old 
Testament; as Origen, Jerome, and many more have 
also thought. But Christ says John 5:39: "Search the 
Scriptures, for they bear witness of me"; and St. Paul 
instructs Timothy [1 Tim. 4:13] to stop reading the 
Scriptures; and boasts Rom. 1:2, how the gospel is 
promised by God in the Scriptures; and in 1 Cor. 15:3 
he says that Christ, according to the Scriptures, 
came from David's blood, died, and rose from death. 
St. Peter also points us more than once to the 
Scriptures [2 Petr. 1, 19. 3, 15]. 

2. so that they may ever teach us not to despise 
the Scriptures of the Old Testament, but to 


2) enhinder - back. In Latin: remittit. 


to read with all diligence, because they themselves 
so powerfully establish and prove the New 
Testament by the Old Testament, and refer to it; as 
also St. Lucas Apost. 17, 11. writes that those in 
Thessalonica daily searched the Scriptures to see if 
it was as Paul taught. As little as the reason and 
proof of the New Testament is to be despised, so 
much is the Old Testament to be respected. And 
what is the New Testament but a public preaching 
and proclamation of Christ, established by the 
sayings in the Old Testament and fulfilled by Christ? 

In order that those who do not know better may 
have guidance and instruction to read it usefully, | 
have written this preface according to my ability, as 
much as God has given me. Please and faithfully 
warn every pious Christian not to be offended by the 
simple speech and story that he will often encounter, 
but do not doubt how badly it can always be regarded 
as vain words, works, deeds, and teachings. 





*This preface is found, as we give it, in the last edition of the Bible, which was printed by Hans Lufft in Wittenberg in 1545. Of the complete editions 
of Luther's works, only the Leipzig edition, vol. XII, p. I and the Erlangen edition, vol. 63, p. 7 have included it. In Latin it is found in the Wittenberg 
(1549), tom. Ill, lol. I and in the Jena one (1603), tom. Walch and the Erlangen edition, which we have followed, place our writing in the year 1523, whereas 
the Jena edition, in the table of contents; to the third Latin volume, in the year 1524. In a somewhat modified version, which fits the Latin version of the 
Bible, it precedes the Latin translation of 1529, which is attributed to Luther, Walch, alte Ausgabe, Bd.

devil's wickedness, Gen. 3, 4. But soon after, 
before Moses' law comes, he teaches from 
where the help should come again to drive 
away sin and death; namely not through law 
nor through his own work, because there was 
no law yet, but through the

W. XIV, 5-7. 7 





more than a vain hindrance, and does not want to 
continue anywhere, as the law demands, that this 
book is a noticeable example, how it is nothing at all 
to make people pious with laws, but, as St. Paul says, 
the law only causes sin and wrath [Rom. 4:15]. 

9. In the fifth, since the people are now punished 
for their disobedience, and God had lured them a 
little with grace, so that they were moved to keep his 
law with pleasure and love out of benevolence, since 
he gave them the two kingdoms, Moses repeats the 
whole law with all the stories they had encountered 
(without what concerns the priesthood), and thus 
explains from the beginning everything that both 
belong to the physical and spiritual government of a 
people, so that Moses, like a perfect teacher of the 
law, would do his duty enough everywhere, and 
would not only give the law, but would also be there 
when it should be done, and where it was lacking, he 
would explain it and restore it. But this declaration in 
the fifth book does not actually keep anything else 
inside, except faith in God and love for one's 
neighbor, for that is where all of God's laws lead. That 
is why Moses, with his transfiguration, fended off all 
that might spoil the glow of God up to the twentieth 
chapter, and all that might hinder love up to the end 
of the book. 

(10) It should be noted here, first of all, that Moses 
so carefully lays down the laws for the people that he 
leaves no room for them to choose any work or to 
invent their own worship. For he not only teaches to 
fear, trust and love God, but also gives so many ways 
of external worship, with sacrifices, vows, fasting, 
mortification, etc., that no one needs to choose 
anything else. He also teaches planting, building, 
freeing, fighting, governing children, servants and 
house, buying and selling, borrowing and lending, 
and everything that is to be done externally and 
internally, so much so that some statutes are to be 
considered foolish and futile. 

(11) Dear one, why does God do this? Finally, he 
subjected the people to be his own, and he wanted 
to be their God; therefore he wanted to govern them 
so that all their doings would be certain to be right 
before him. 


1) langen = to aim. In Latin: is est scopus. 





would be. For if anyone does anything without first 
receiving the word of God, it is not valid in the sight 
of God and is lost. For he also decrees in the 5th 
book, Cap. 4, 2. 12, 32. that they should do nothing 
to his laws. And Cap. 12, 8, he says that they should 
not do what they think is right. Also the Psalter and 
all the prophets cry out that the people do good works 
that they themselves have chosen and that God has 
not commanded. For he will not and cannot suffer his 
own to do anything that he has not commanded, no 
matter how good it may be. For obedience is the 
nobility and goodness of all works, who hold fast to 
the words of God. 

Since this life cannot be without outward worship 
and ways, he has set before them such diverse ways 
and written them with his commandment, so that if 
they had to or even wanted to do any outward service 
to God, they would attack these and not devise their 
own, so that they would be sure and certain that their 
work would be in God's word and obedience. Thus 
they are everywhere prevented from following their 
own reason and free will, from doing good and living 
well, and yet enough space, place, time, person, 
work and manner are determined and provided that 
they must not complain, nor must they follow the 
example of other people's services. 

13 In addition, it should be noted that the laws are 
of three kinds. There are some that speak only of 
temporal goods, as the imperial laws do here. These 
are mostly set by God for the sake of the wicked, so 
that they do no harm. Therefore, such laws are only 
laws of defense, more than doctrinal laws. As when 
Moses bade that a wife be filled with a bill of 
divorcement [Deut. 24:1], item, that a man drive his 
wife with a sacrifice of jealousy [Deut. 5:14], and may 
take other wives more [Deut. 25:5]; these are all 
worldly laws. But there are some who teach about 
outward worship, as stated above. 

14. Now over these two go the laws of faith and 
love, so that all other laws must and should have their 
measure from faith and love; that they should go 
where their works thus go, 


8 Erl. 63, 13-15. 


That they go not contrary to faith and love; but where 
they go contrary to faith and love, they shall be evil. 
15 Therefore we read that David did not kill Joab 
the murderer when he deserved to die twice [2 Sam. 
3, 27. 20, 10.), and 2 Sam. 14, 11. he vowed to the 
woman of Thekoa that her son should not die, even 
if he had strangled his brother; item, Absalom he did 
not kill either [2 Sam. 14, 21.]. Item, he himself, 
David, ate of the holy bread of the priests, 1 Sam. 
21, 6. Item, Thamar thought that the king would give 
her to Amnon, her stepbrother, in marriage [2 Sam. 
13, 13.]. From these and similar stories it can be 
seen that the kings, priests and rulers have often 
taken fresh recourse to the law where faith and love 
have demanded it: that therefore faith and love 
should be the master of all laws and have them all in 
their power. For since all laws are based on faith and 
love, none of them should no longer apply, nor 
should there be a law that is contrary to faith or love. 
(16) For this reason, the Jews are still today 
almost very much mistaken, because they keep 
some of the laws of Moses so strictly and harshly, 
and let love and peace perish much sooner than they 
eat or drink with us, or do something like that, and do 
not see the law's opinion rightly. For this 
understanding is necessary for all who live under the 
law, not only for the Jews. For thus also Christ says, 
Matt. 12:11, that one should break the Sabbath when 
an ox had fallen into a pit, and help him out, which 
was only a temporal need and harm. How much 
more should one break all kinds of laws when 
necessity demands it, so that nothing else is contrary 
to faith and love? As Christ says that David did when 
he ate the holy bread, Marc. 2:25 ff. 
017 But what is the matter, that Moses casteth the 
laws so disorderly one with another? Why does he 
not put the secular in one heap, the spiritual also in 
one heap, and faith and love also in one heap? in 
addition, he sometimes repeats a law so often, and 
uses the same words so many times, that it is equally 
tiresome to read and hear. Answer: Moses writes, as 
it drives itself, that its Bnch a picture and

The example is of the regiment and life. For so it 
goes, when it goes in the swing, that now this work, 
now that must be done. And no man can so arrange 
his life (if it is to be otherwise divine) that he practices 
this day vainly spiritual, the other vainly worldly law, 
but God thus governs all laws among themselves, as 
the stars in the sky and the flowers in the field stand, 
that man must be ready every hour for each, and do 
whichever comes first before his hand. Thus the 
book of Moses is also mixed together. 

(18) But that he is so almost impulsive, and often 
repeats the same thing, is also a sign of his office. 
For he who is to govern a law-governed people must 
always stop, always drive, and bluff his way along 
with the people, as with donkeys. For no law goes 
out with pleasure and love; it is all forced and 
compelled. Because Moses is a teacher of the law, 
he must show with his activity how the laws are 
forced works, and make the people tired, until they 
recognize through such activity their sickness and 
unwillingness to God's law, and seek grace, as 
follows. 

In the third place, this is the right opinion of 
Moses, that he reveals sin through the law and 
disgraces all presumption of human ability. For this 
reason St. Paul calls him a minister of sin, Gal. 3, 19, 
and his ministry a ministry of death, 2 Cor. 3, 6. And 
Rom. 3, 20. and Cap. 7, 7. he says: "Through the law 
comes no more than the knowledge of sin"; and 
Rom. 3, 20: "Through the work of the law no one 
becomes righteous before God. For Moses can do 
no more by the law, neither can he tell us what to do 
and what not to do, but he does not give us the power 
and the ability to do and not to do such things, and 
so he leaves us stuck in sin. If we are stuck in sin, 
then death comes upon us immediately as a revenge 
and punishment for sin. Therefore St. Paul calls the 
sin of death sting [1 Cor. 15:56], that death through 
sin has all its right and power over us. But where the 
law would not be, there would be no sin [Rom. 4, 15]. 
Therefore it is all Mosi's fault, who reproves sin by 
the law; so death follows sin with force, that Mosi's 
office is to be found in the law. 


10 


is rightly and justly called a ministry of sin and death 
by St. Paul [2 Cor. 3:6]; for he brings nothing upon us 
by his lawgiving but sin and death. 

(20) Yet such a ministry of sin and death is good 
and almost necessary. For where God's law is not, all 
human reason is so blind that it cannot recognize sin 
[Rom. 3, 20. 7, 8.]. For no human reason knows that 
unbelief and despairing of God is sin, indeed, it knows 
nothing of the fact that one should believe and trust in 
God; therefore, in its blindness it goes stubbornly and 
never feels such sin; meanwhile, it does good works 
and leads an outwardly respectable life. Then she 
thinks that she is well, and that the matter is done; as 
we see in the heathen and hypocrites, when they live 
to the best of their ability. Nor does she know that the 
evil inclination of the flesh and hatred of enemies is 
sin, but because she sees and feels that all men are 
so skillful, she considers it natural and a good thing, 
and thinks it is enough if one only outwardly resists 
the works. So she goes there and considers her 
illness as strength, her sin as right, her evil as good, 
and can go no further. 

Behold, to drive out this blindness and hardened 
presumption is Mose's office. Now he cannot drive it 
out, he must reveal it and make it known. This he 
does through the law, teaching that one should fear, 
trust, believe and love God, and that one should not 
bear or have any evil desire or hatred toward any 
man. Because nature hears this, it must be 
frightened, for it certainly finds neither trust nor faith, 
neither fear nor love of God; item, neither love nor 
purity toward one's neighbor, but unbelief, doubt, 
contempt and hatred of God, and evil will and lust 
toward one's neighbor. But because it finds such 
things, death is immediately before its eyes, which will 
devour such a sinner and devour him into hell. 

(22) Behold, this is to bring death upon us through 
sin, 1) and to kill us through sin. That is, to stir up sin 
by the law, and to set it before our eyes, and to put all 
our

11 


The devil's presumption drives him into despondency 
and trembling and despair, so that he can do no more 
than cry out with the prophet: | am rejected of God 
[Is. 49, 14], or as one says in German: Ich bin des 
Teufels, ich kann nimmermehr selig werden. That 
means led into hell. This is what St. Paul means in 
short words, 1 Cor. 15:56: "The sting of death is sin; 
but the law is the power of sins." As if to say, that the 
sting of death strangles us, the sin that is found in us 
makes us guilty of death. 2) But that sin is found in 
us, and so powerfully gives us to death, makes the 
law, which reveals and teaches us to know sin, which 
we did not know before, and were sure of. 

(23) Now behold, with what violence Moses 
performs and executes his office. For in order that he 
may defile nature to the utmost, he not only gives 
laws concerning natural and real sins, such as the 
Ten Commandments, but also makes sin, since 
there is otherwise no sin by nature, and presses and 
presses on it with heaps of sins. For unbelief and evil 
desire is full of sin, and worthy of death. But not to 
eat leavened bread on Easter [Exodus 12:15], not to 
eat unclean animals [Leviticus 11:4 ff], not to put a 
mark on the body [Leviticus 19:28, 21:5], and 
everything that the Levitical priesthood does with 
sins is not of the nature of sin and evil, but becomes 
sin only because it is forbidden by the law, which law 
may well be abolished. But the ten commandments 
may not be so, for there is sin, if the commandments 
were not, or were not known. Just as unbelief among 
the Gentiles is sin, even though they do not know or 
consider that it is sin. 

24 Thus we see that these and many other laws 
of Moses were not given for the sole purpose that no 
one should choose anything of his own to do good 
and to live well, as was said above, but rather so that 
sins would only become many and would multiply 
beyond measure to weigh down the conscience, so 
that hardened blindness might be recognized. 


2) That is: the sin that is guilty of death. In Latin: affert enim 
secum mortem ceu poenam.

13 





and would have to feel their own inability and 
insufficiency for good, and thus would be compelled 
and urged by the law to seek something further than 
the law and their own ability, namely God's grace, 
promised in the future Christ. For all the law of God 
is good and right, even if it means only carrying dung 
or picking up straws. But he must not be pious, nor of 
good heart, who does not keep such good law, or 
keeps it unwillingly. All nature is unable to do 
otherwise than to keep unwillingly; therefore it must 
recognize and feel its wickedness here in the good 
law of God, and sigh and strive for the help of divine 
grace in Christ. 

(25) Therefore, when Christ comes, the law 
ceases, especially the Levitical law, which makes sin, 
since otherwise there is no sin of this kind, as has 
been said. So also the ten commandments cease; 
not that they should not be kept, nor that they should 
not be fulfilled, but the ministry of Moses ceases in 
that it no longer makes sin strong through the ten 
commandments, and sin is no longer the sting of 
death. For through Christ sin is forgiven, God is 
reconciled, and the heart has begun to be devoted to 
the law, so that it can no longer punish the ministry of 
Moses and make it sinful, as if it had not kept the 
commandments and was guilty of death, as it was 
before grace and before Christ came. 

26 St. Paul teaches this in 2 Cor. 3, 14, when he 
says that the clarity in the face of Moses ceases for 
the sake of clarity in the face of Jesus Christ. That is, 
the ministry of Moses, which made us sinful and 
ashamed with the brightness of the knowledge of our 
wickedness and worthlessness, no longer harms us, 
nor does it frighten us with death. For we now have 
clarity in the face of Christ, that is, the ministry of 
grace, by which we know Christ, with what 
righteousness, life and strength we fulfill the law, 
overcoming death and hell. Just as the three apostles 
on Mount Thabor saw Moses and Eliam, and yet did 
not shrink from them because of the lovely clarity in 
the face of Christ [Matth. 17, 4. Luc. 9, 33.]. But 2 
Mos. 34, 30. 33., since Christ was not present, the 
children of Israel could not see the clarity and shining 
in 





Mosi's face, so he had to put a blanket over it. 

(27) For there are three kinds of disciples of the 
law: the first, who hear the law, and despise it, lead a 
reprobate life, without fear; to these the law cometh 
not. And are signified by the calf servants in the 
wilderness, because of whom Moses cast in pieces 
the two tables, and brought not the law unto them [Ex. 
32:6, 19]. 

The others, who attack to fulfill it with their own 
strength, without grace, are meant by those who 
could not see Mosi's face when he brought the tablets 
the other time [Ex 34:30]. To these the law comes, 
but they do not suffer it, therefore they make a 
covering over it, and lead a hypocritical life with 
outward works of the law, which nevertheless the law 
makes everything sins, where the covering is taken 
off. For the law proves that our ability is nothing 
without Christ's grace. 

The third are those who see Moses clearly without 
covering. These are the ones who understand the 
law's opinion, as it is impossible to demand. There 
sin goes in power [1 Cor. 15:56], there death is 
mighty, there Goliath's spear is like a weaver's beam, 
and his sting has six hundred shekels of brass, so 
that all the children of Israel flee from him; without the 
one David, Christ our Lord, delivers us from all this. 
For if Christ's clarity did not come alongside such 
clarity of Moses, no one could bear such glories of 
the law, sin and the terror of death. These fall away 
from all works and presumption, and learn no more 
from the law, but only to recognize sin and to groan 
for Christ, which is also the true ministry of Moses 
and the law, Gal. 3, 24. 

30 Moses himself indicated that his ministry and 
teaching should last until Christ, and then cease, 
when he says, Deut. 18, 15: "The Lord your God will 
raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, 
like me, and you shall hear him" 2c. This is the 
noblest saying, and certainly the core in all of Moses, 
which also the apostles have highly led and strongly 
used [Joh. 1, 45. 6, 14. Apost. 3, 22. 7, 37..] to affirm 
the gospel and to abolish the law; and all prophets 
drew much from it. For

people of Israel the land of Canaan, where they 
would keep it. And also gave it to them, and was 
confirmed by death and blood of sheep and goats 
[Ex. 24, 8]. But because such a testament was not 
based on God's grace, but on man's works, it had to 
grow old and cease, and the promised land was lost 
again, because by works the law could not be fulfilled. 
And there must come an arid testament, which shall 
not wax old, neither stand upon our doings, but upon 
the word and works of God, that it may endure for 
ever [Heb. 13:20]. Therefore it is also confirmed by 
the death and blood of an eternal person, and an 
eternal land is promised and given. This is what was 
said about Mosi's books and ministry. 

(32) Now what are the other books of the prophets 
and of the histories? Answer: Nothing other than what 
Moses is, for they all carry out the ministry of Moses, 
and prevent the false prophets from leading the 
people to works, but let them remain in the right 
ministry of Moses and knowledge of the law. And hold 
fast that by the right understanding of the law they 
keep the people in their own immorality, and drive 
them to Christ, as Moses does. For this reason, they 
also continue to delete what Moses said about Christ, 
and show by both examples: those who are right with 
Moses and those who are wrong with him, and the 
punishment and reward of both, so that the prophets 
are nothing else, but 


1) This reading is found in the 1545 edition, likewise in the Weimar Bible 
(1686) and in Latin. Later editions offer "prophets" instead of "Moses". 


If you want to interpret well and with certainty, take 
Christ before you, for this is the man to whom 
everything and completely applies. So make Aaron 
the high priest, but Christ alone, as the epistle to the 
Hebrews does [Cap. 7, 15. ff.], which alone is almost 
sufficient to interpret all the figures of Moses. So it is 
also certain that Christ Himself is the sacrifice, even 
the altar, who offered Himself with His own blood, as 
also the same epistle reports [Cap.7, 27. 13, 10.]. As 
the Levitical high priest by such sacrifice took away 
only the sins that were not sin by nature, so our high 
priest Christ by his own sacrifice and blood took away 
the real sin, which is sin by nature, and once passed 
through the veil to God to make atonement for us, so 
that everything that is written about the high priest you 
point to Christ personally, and to no one else. 

(35) But the sons of the high priest, which deal in 
daily sacrifice, thou shalt point to us Christians, who, 
sitting before Christ our Father in heaven, dwell here 
on earth with the body, and are not with him through 
it, without spiritual faith. The same ministry, as they 
slay and sacrifice, means nothing else than preaching 
the gospel, by which the old man is put to death and 
offered to God, burned and consumed by the fire of 
love in the Holy Spirit, which is well pleasing in the 
sight of God, that is, it makes a good, clean, safe 
conscience before God.

This interpretation is found in St. Paul Rom. 12, 1, 
where he teaches how we should offer our bodies to 
God as a living, holy, acceptable sacrifice. Which we 
do (as | said) by constant practice of the Gospel, both 
with preaching and faith. This is enough for a short 
instruction to search for Christ and the Gospel in the 
Old Testament. 

(In the first edition of 1523, which contains only the five books of 
Moses, there is still the following piece:) 

Let it be known to those who read this Bible that | 
have chosen to write the name of God, which the 
Jews call Tetragrammaton, in capital letters, that is, 
LORD, and the other, which they call Adonai, in half 
capital letters, that is, HEART. For among all the 
names of God, these two alone are attributed to the 
right, true God in Scripture, but the others are often 
attributed to angels and saints. | have done this so 
that one can conclude quite powerfully that Christ is 
true God, because Jeremiah Cap. 23, 6. calls him 
LORD, when he says: They will call him LORD, our 
righteous one. So all more places of the like are to be 
found. 

Hereby | command all my readers to Christ, and 
ask that they help me to obtain from God the 
usefulness of this work. For | freely confess that | 
have undertaken too much, especially to translate 
the Old Testament. For the Hebrew language lies, 
unfortunately, too low, that even the Jews 
themselves know little enough of it, and their glosses 
and interpretations (which | have tried) are not to be 
trusted. And beware, if the Bible is to come forth, we 
who are Christians must do it, as those who have the 
mind of Christ, without which even the art of language 
is nothing. Which lack half a lot of the old interpreters, 
also Jerome, have lacked in many places. But |, 
although | cannot boast that I have attained 
everything, may nevertheless say that this German 
Bible is lighter and more certain in many places than 
the Latin, that it is true, where the printers do not spoil 
it with their carelessness (as they are wont to do), the 
German language certainly has a better Bible here 
than the Latin language. | refer to the readers. 

3. now also the manure will attach to the wheel 





And no one will be so rude as not to be master over 
me here and there, and reproach me here and there. 
Well, | will let them go. | have thought it through from 
the beginning, that | would find ten thousand who 
would criticize my work, before | would find one who 
would give me the twentieth part. | also wanted to be 
quite learned, and prove my art deliciously, if | should 
reprove St. Jerome's Latin Bible, but he should also 
offer me defiance again, that | should copy him. Now, 
if someone is so nearly learned about me, let him 
take the Bible and translate it completely, and then 
tell me again what he can do. If he does it better, why 
should one not prefer it to me? | also thought | was 
learned, and | also know myself to be more learned 
than all high schools of sophists, by the grace of God; 
but now | see that | also do not yet know my native 
German language. | have also not yet read any book 
or letter in which the right kind of German language 
would be inside. No one pays any attention to 
speaking German properly, especially the gentlemen 
in the law offices, and the lumpen preachers and 
puppet writers who make themselves believe that 
they have the power to change the German 
language, and every day they invent new words for 
us: — beherzigen, behandigen, _ ersprieBlich, 
erschieBlich, 1) and the like. Yes, dear man, it is well 
heard and learned. 

4 Summa, if we all worked together, we would still 
have enough work to do on the Bible to bring it to 
light, one with understanding, the other with 
language. For |, too, have not worked on this alone, 
but have used it wherever | could find someone. 
Therefore | ask everyone to leave his blasphemy and 
the poor people unconfused, but help me where he 
can. If he will not, let him take the Bible himself and 
make it his own. For those who only blaspheme and 
criticize are certainly not so pious and honest that 
they would like to have a more truthful Bible; for they 
know that they are not able to do so, but would like 
to be masters of other people's art, who have never 
been disciples in their own art. May God complete 
the work He has begun. Amen.

3, preface about the book of Job 


with the appendix found in the first printing Anno 1524. *) 


1 The book of Job deals with this question: 
whether even the pious suffer misfortune from God? 
Here Job stands firm and holds that God also 
torments the pious without cause, only for His praise, 
as Christ Joh. 9, 3. also testifies of the one who was 
born of the covenant. 

(2) Against this his friends sit down, and make 
great and long talk, wanting to keep God right, that 
he punishes no pious man; but if he punishes, then 
he must have sinned; and so have a worldly and 
human thought of God and his righteousness, as if 
he were like men, and his right like the right of the 
world is. 

(3) Although Job, too, when he comes into mortal 
distress, speaks too much against God out of human 
weakness, and sins in suffering; and yet he insists 
that he is not guilty of such suffering before others, 
as is true. But in the end, God judges that Job, in 
speaking against God in suffering, has spoken 
wrongly, but that what he held against his friends 
about his innocence before suffering, he has spoken 
rightly. 

4 Thus this book finally leads us to the conclusion 
that God alone is righteous, and yet one man is 
righteous against another, even before God. But it is 
written for our comfort that God allows His great 
saints to stumble, especially in adversity. For before 
Job is in fear of death, he praises God over the 
robbery of his goods and the death of his children. 
But when death comes to him under 


1) "such a" - such. 


When a man's eyes go out and God is revealed, his 
words show what thoughts a man has (be he as holy 
as he wants to be) against God: how he thinks that 
God is not God, but a vain judge and an angry tyrant, 
who drives by force, and asks for no one's good life. 
This is the highest piece in this book. Only those 
understand this who also experience and feel what it 
is to suffer God's wrath and judgment, and to have 
His grace hidden. 

5. 2) But the speech of this book is so rich and 
splendid, as certainly no book in the whole Scripture; 
and if one should interpret it everywhere from word 
to word, and not that several times according to the 
sense (as the Jews and unintelligent interpreters 
want), no one would understand it. As when he 
speaks like this or like this: "The thirsty will drink up 
his goods", that is, the robbers will take it from him. 
Item: "The children of arrogance have never walked 
on it," that is, the young lions who walk proudly; and 
many such things. Item, "light" he calls happiness, 
"darkness" misfortune 2c. For this reason, | fear that 
this third part will have to stand in for it and be 
rebuked by the smart ones, because it is a different 
book than the Latin Bible has. We let it go. We have 
taken pains to give a clear speech that is 
understandable to everyone, with an unadulterated 
sense and understanding; may someone suffer to do 
better.

4, preface from the Psalter, *) 


1528 or 1529. 


(1) Many holy fathers have praised and loved the 
Psalter especially above other books of Scripture. 
And indeed, the work itself praises its master 
enough; but we must also prove our praise and 
thanks by it. 

(2) In years past, almost many legends of the 
saints, passions, books of examples and histories 
were circulated, and the world was filled with them, 
so that the Psalter lay under the bench and in such 
darkness that one could not understand one Psalm 
well, and yet it gave off such an excellent noble smell 
that all pious hearts felt devotion and strength even 
from the unknown words, and loved the booklet for 
that reason. 

(3) But | hold that no finer book of examples or 
legends of the saints has come or may come on 
earth than the Psalter. And if one should wish that 
out of all the examples, legends, histories, the best 
should be read and brought together and presented 
in the best way, then it would have to be the present 
Psalter. For here we find not only what one or two 
saints have done, but what the head of all saints has 
done, and what all saints still do; how they stand 
against God, against friends and enemies, how they 
conduct themselves in all trials and tribulations; 
above all, that all kinds of divine, salvific teachings 
and commandments are contained therein. 

4 And should the Psalter be precious and dear 
only because it promises so clearly of Christ's death 
and resurrection, and exemplifies His kingdom and 
the state and nature of all Christendom, that it might 
well be a small 





The Biblia is called the Biblia, in which everything 
that is found in the entire Biblia is summarized in the 
most beautiful and briefest way, and is made and 
prepared into a fine encyclopedia or manual, so that 
it seems to me that the Holy Spirit Himself wanted to 
take the trouble and bring together a brief Bible and 
book of examples of all of Christendom or all of the 
saints, so that whoever could not read the entire 
Biblia would still have almost the entire Summa 
written down in a small booklet. 

5. But above all this is the noble virtue and manner 
of the Psalter, that other books rumble much about 
the works of the saints, but say very little about their 
words; The Psalter is an example of this, in which it 
shines so well and sweetly when one reads in it, that 
it not only tells the works of the saints, but also their 
words, how they spoke and prayed with God, and still 
speak and pray, that the other legends and 
examples, where they are held up against the 
Psalter, hold up to us almost vain dumb saints, but 
the Psalter imagines real, brave, living saints to us. 

(6) A mute man is to be considered almost half- 
dead compared to a speaking man. And there is no 
more powerful or noble work in man than speech, 
since man is most distinguished from other animals 
by speech, more than by form or other works, 
because even a wooden kaun can have the form of 
a man by carving, and an animal can see, hear, 
smell, sing, walk, stand, eat, drink, fast, thirst, suffer 
hunger, frost and hard lodging, as well as a man. 


*The time determination given by us deviates from the usual one so far. Walch, in his preface to the fourteenth volume, p. 4, says: "Lutherus wrote 


this preface to the German version of the Psalter, which came to light in 1531." The Erlanger, vol. 63, p. 27, has placed under the title: "From the year 
1531," and notes: "the present preface first appeared in Latin in the year 1526." We have already stated in the fourth volume of our edition (Col. 1 ff. note) 
that our writing was written by Luther in German, and assume that the same was already prefixed to the thoroughly improved edition of the "Uebersetzung 


des Psalters" in 1528. In Olearii autographis Lutheri p. 30, a specially published "Praefatio nova D. M. L. in Psalterium, lat. reddita per 
Justum Jonam. Witteb. 1529. 8." is cited. It can hardly be doubted that this Praefatio nova is identical with the, 
which is printed in the Psalterium Translationis Veteris correctum published by Joh. Lufft in 1529. It is quoted in its first words: Multi ex 


veteribus et sanctis patribus Psalterium prae omnibus reliquis scripturae libris commendarunt, etc. This is just our preface. We have 
dealt with it in detail in the fourth volume of our edition 1. above, also indicating the locations in the collections. 


22 Erl. 3, s9-3i. 


(7) Moreover, the Psalter does more than this, that it 
models for us not bad, common speeches of the saints, 
but the very best, which they spoke with great 
earnestness, in the most excellent matter, with God 
Himself, so that it presents to us not only their word 
about their works, but also their heart and the thorough 
treasure of their souls, so that we can see into the 
reason and source of their words and works, that is, into 
their heart, what thoughts they had, how their heart 
stood and held itself, in all kinds of things, trials and 
hardships. Which the legends or examples, which only 
boast of the saints' work or miracles, do not do, nor can 
they do. For | cannot know how his heart stands, though 
| see or hear many excellent works of one. 
8. just as | would much rather hear a saint speak than 
see his works, so | would much rather see his heart and 
the treasure in his soul than hear his words. This is what 
the Psalter gives us most abundantly about the saints, 
so that we can be sure what their hearts were like and 
what their words were like toward God and everyone. 
(9) For a human heart is like a ship on a wild sea, driven 
by the storm winds from the four corners of the world. 
Here fear and worry of future misfortune pushes; there 
sorrow and sadness of present misfortune sail. Here 
weaves 1) hope and presumption of future happiness; 
there blows security and joy in present goods. 
(10) Such tempests teach to speak with earnestness, 
and to open the heart, and to pour out the bottom. For 
he who is in fear and distress speaks much differently of 
calamity than he who is in joy; and he who is in joy 
speaks and sings much differently of joy than he who is 
in fear. It is not from the heart that a sad man should 
laugh or a happy man should weep; that is, the reason 
of his heart is not open and is not out. 

(11) Now what is the most in the Psalter, but 
such earnest speeches in all such tempests? 


1) This has Walch and after him the Erlangen edition changed to "weht". But 
the original offers: "webt"; the German Wittenberg: "webd".

writhing? Where can you find finer words of joy than 
the Psalms of praise or thanksgiving have? There 
you see all the saints in the heart, as if in beautiful, 
joyful girdles, yes, as if in heaven, as its, hearty, joyful 
flowers are rising up in it from all kinds of beautiful, 
joyful thoughts towards God for His good deeds. 
Again, where do you find deeper, more miserable, 
more pitiful words of sadness than the lament Psalms 
have? There you look into the heart of all the saints, 
as into death, yes, as into hell. How dark and gloomy 
it is there from all kinds of sorrowful sight of the wrath 
of God! So also, where they speak of fear and hope, 
they need such words that no painter could paint fear 
or hope for you, and no Cicero or orator could model 
it for you. 

12. and (as | said) this is the very best thing, that 
they speak such words against God and with God, 
which makes that there is twofold earnestness and 
life in the words. For where one otherwise speaks 
against men in such matters, it does not go so 
strongly from the heart, does not burn, live and 
penetrate so nearly. That is why the Psalter is a 
booklet of all the saints, and every man, in whatever 
he is, finds psalms and words in it that rhyme with his 
own things, and are so even to him as if they were 
set for his sake alone, that he himself cannot set them 
better, nor find them better, nor desire them better. 
Which is good, then, that if such words please a man 
and rhyme with him, he may be sure that he is in the 
fellowship of the saints, and has gone to all the saints 
as he goes, because they all sing a little song with 
him; especially if he can speak them to God as they 
have done; which must be done in faith, for they taste 
nothing to an ungodly man. 2) 

(13) Last of all, in the Psalter there is safety anda 
safe guide, so that one can follow all the saints in it 
without danger. For other examples and legends, of 
the dumb saints, bring forth many a work that cannot 
be done; but they bring forth many more works that 
are dangerous to do. 


2) This has been translated by Justus Jonas: insipidi sunt = they are 
tasteless.

and commonly set up souls and mobs, and lead and 
snatch them away from the fellowship of the saints. 
But the Psalter keeps thee from the company of the 
saints, for it teacheth thee to be and to speak alike in 
joy, fear, hope, and sorrow, as all the saints have 
been and are. 

If you want to see the holy Christian church 
painted with vivid color and form in a small picture, 
take the Psalter before you, and you will have a fine, 
bright, pure mirror that will show you what 
Christianity is. Yes, you will also find yourself inside, 


and the right yuw$! O€QUTOV 

and God Himself and all creatures. 

(15) Therefore, let us also take care that we give 
thanks to God for such unspeakable goods, and with 
diligence and earnestness accept them, use them, 
and practice them, to praise and honor God, lest with 
our ingratitude we 


We deserve something troublesome for our time. For 
before, in the time of darkness, what a treasure it 
would have been, who could have rightly understood 
one Psalm, and read or heard it in intelligible 
German, and yet have not had it. But now blessed 
are the eyes that see, that we see, and the ears that 
hear, that we hear. And yet, alas, we see that we are 
like the Jews in the wilderness, who said of the bread 
of heaven, "Our soul is disgusted with the little food." 
But we also ought to know that it is written there, how 
they were afflicted and died, lest we also be so. 

16 May the Father of all grace and mercy help us 
through Jesus Christ our Lord. To whom be praise 
and thanksgiving, honor and glory for this German 
Psalter, and for all its innumerable, unspeakable 
benefits for eternity, Amen, Amen! 





5 Preface on the Psalter published in Neuburg on the Danube in 1545, *) 


1 Every Christian who wishes to pray and be 
devout should let the Psalter be his little book, and it 
would be good for every Christian to practice it and 
become so proficient in it that he could use it from 
word to word and always have it in his mouth, as 
often as something occurs to him to speak or do, so 
that he could lead and draw a saying from it as a 
proverb. For it is true that whatever a devout heart 
may desire to pray, there it finds its psalms and 
words so plain and sweet that no man, indeed all 
men, can devise such good ways, words, and 
devotions. Moreover, he also teaches and comforts 
in prayer, and is drawn through the Lord's Prayer, 
and the Lord's Prayer through him, so that one can 
be understood very finely from the other, and 
harmonize together. 

2 Therefore, not only the previous prayer books 
should be read, since they contain almost all 
unchristian lies and 





Forbid and abolish abuses, even in the best little 
prayers, where our Lord's suffering is drawn 
inwardly, and yet is used shamefully not for faith but 
for temporal use and custom, but also see to it that 
none of the new little prayers are torn down again. 
For it has already begun that almost everyone wants 
to make prayers according to his devotion, also 


paraphrases of the Psalter, and 

Thus, his work will be praised and used in the church 
and among Christians, just as if the Psalter or the 
Lord's Prayer were a bad, small thing. And where this 
is not understood and measured, the Psalter and Our 
Father will be held in contempt. | let them be good in 
part, but the Psalter and Our Father should be better, 
even the best. Whoever learns to pray them correctly 
has learned to pray far above all prayers, especially 
because the Psalter has now been comprehensibly 
translated by God's grace. 


*The location of this writing in the editions, also otherwise all necessary information about the same, is already given in the fourth volume of 


our edition, Col. 2, at the end of the note.

(3) | have heard a story of how a devout person was 
so fond of the Lord's Prayer that she prayed it with 
tears of great devotion. Then a bishop of good 
opinion wanted to improve the devotion, took the Our 
Father from her, gave her many good devotional 
prayers; but then she lost all devotion, and had to 
leave the devotional prayers and accept the Our 
Father again. If anyone should try a little more 
earnestly with the Psalter and Our Father, he should 
soon give up the devotional prayer. 





Give leave, and say: Oh it is not the juice, strength, 
heat and fire that | find in the Psalter, it tastes too 
cold and hard to me 2c. 

4 Our dear Lord, who taught us and gave us the 
Psalter and the Lord's Prayer, grant us also the spirit 
of prayer and grace, that we may pray with joy and 
earnest faith, strongly and without ceasing, for we 
have need of it; so he has commanded, and so he 
would have us do. To him be praise, honor and 
thanksgiving forever and ever, amen. 


6, preface to the books of Solomon. *) 


1524. 


(1) Three books have the name of Solomon. The 
first is Proverbia, Proverbs, which may be called a 
book of good works, for in it he teaches how to live 
well before God and the world. 

(2) And especially he takes the dear youth before 
him, and he calls them quite fatherly to God's 
commandments with comforting promises, how it 
should go well with the pious, and with sorrows, how 
the wicked must be punished. For the youth itself is 
inclined to all evil, as an inexperienced people who 
does not understand the world and the devil's 
cunning and wickedness, and is much too weak to 
resist the evil examples and excitements, and is not 
able to govern itself, but, if it is not drawn before it 
looks around, is corrupt and lost. 

Therefore, it may well and must have teachers 
and governors who admonish, warn, punish, chastise 
it, and always keep to God's fear and commandment 
to ward off the devil, the world and the flesh. As 
Solomon does in this book with all diligence and 
abundance, and puts his teachings into proverbs, so 
that they are the more easily grasped and better kept, 
so that every man who intends to become pious may 
well keep such a book for his daily manual or prayer 
book, and often read it and look at his life in it. 





(4) For there must be a way, either to have one's 
father chastened, or to have one's executioner 
punished, as one says, If thou escape me, thou shalt 
not escape the executioner. And it would be good if 
young people were always made to believe this, so 
that they would know without a doubt that they would 
have to suffer either their father's rod or the 
executioner's sword, just as Solomon always 
threatens the disobedient with death in this book. For 
nothing else comes of it, God leaves nothing 
unpunished. As one sees in experience, that the 
disobedient bad boys perish so very strangely, and 
at last come into the hands of the executioner, when 
they are least careful and safest. The gallows, 
wheels and raven stones on the road in front of all 
cities, which God has placed there by the secular 
regime, are public witnesses and signs of this, to the 
horror of all who do not want to be drawn with God's 
word and obey their parents. 

Therefore, in this book Solomon calls all those 
who despise God's commandments "fools" and those 
who keep God's commandments "wise men. He 
does not only refer to the youth, whom he intends to 
teach, but to all classes, from the highest to the 
lowest. For just as the youth has its own vices, 
contrary to God's commandment, so 


*This preface first appeared in the third part of the Old Testament, which contained the translation of Job, the Psalter and the Books of Solomon. In 
the editions: in the Leipziger, vol. XII, p. Il; by Walch, and in the Erlanger, vol. 63, p. 35. At the same time as this, the following two prefaces also appeared. 


28 Erl. 63, 36-38. Prefaces to the German Bible translation. W.xiv, 32-34. 


all other classes also have their vices, and they are 
worse than the vices of youth; as the saying goes, 
the older, the worse. And again, age does not help 
any folly. 

(6) And if there be nothing else evil in the other 
and high classes, as there is avarice, pride, hatred, 
envy, 2c., yet this certain vice is evil enough, that they 
desire to be wise and prudent, when they ought not 
to be, and every man is inclined to do otherwise than 
he is commanded, and to forbear what he is 
commanded. For he who is in the spiritual office 
wants to be prudent and active in the secular office, 
and here his wisdom is at an end; again, he who is in 
the secular office has his head too narrow for the rest 
of the art of governing the spiritual office. 

(7) All the countries, all the cities, all the 
henchmen are full of such fools, and in this book they 
are diligently punished, and each one is admonished 
to wait for the lowering, and to do faithfully and 
diligently what he is commanded to do. And this is no 
longer a virtue; for to be obedient and to wait for what 
he is commanded to do is what wise men are called. 
The disobedient are called fools, although they do 
not want to be or be called disobedient or fools. 

(8) The other book is called Koheleth, which we 
call Ecclesiastes, and it is a book of consolation; for 
if a man will live obediently to the teaching of the first 
book, and wait for his command or office, the Teu- 


1) Erlanger: none.

The world and his own flesh are so contrary to him 
that he grows tired and weary of his position, and he 
regrets everything he has begun, because it will not 
go on as he would like. Then toil and labor, 
unwillingness, impatience and grumbling arise, so 
that a man will let his hands and feet go, and do 
nothing more. For where the devil cannot resist 
obedience on the right hand side with forwardness 
and pleasure, he wants to hinder it on the left hand 
side with effort and repugnance. 

9 As now. Solomon in the first book teaches 
obedience against the madness and arrogance, so 
he teaches in this book, against the unwillingness 
and temptation, to be patient and constant in 
obedience, and to always wait for the hour with 
peace and joy. And what he cannot keep nor change, 
always let it go, it will probably be found. 

The third book is a hymn in which Solomon 
praises God for obedience, as a gift from God. For 
where God does not keep house and rule himself, 
there is neither obedience nor peace in any state. But 
where there is obedience or good government, God 
dwells there, and kisses and caresses His dear bride 
with His word, which is the kiss of His mouth. So, 
where it goes in the land or house according to the 
two books (as much as it can be), one may well sing 
this third book, and give thanks to God, who has not 
only taught us such things, but has also done them 
himself, amen. 


7, preface from the Proverbs of Solomon. *) 


1524. 


(1) Because this book in particular has much to do 
with fools and wise men, and everywhere praises 
wisdom and chides foolishness, it is necessary to 
hear the language and words that he wants to be 
understood by "fools" and "wise men. Therefore, so 
that this useful book will be the clearer, | want to 
strike out some words here recently, as clearly as | 
can. 


(2) This is the way of King David in the Psalter, 
and especially of King Solomon, and may have been 
the way of the language in those days, that they are 
called fools or fools, not those who are called fools in 
the sight of the world, or who are born fools; but all 
manner of loose, careless, heedless people, most of 
them who drive, do, speak, without the word of God, 
out of their own reasoning and presumption; as 


*This preface is found in the Hallische Theile, p. 168; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XII, p. 12 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 63, p. 38. The following 


preface follows immediately in the editions just given.

Commonly are the greatest, smartest, most powerful, 
richest and holiest before the world. Just as Paul 
calls the Galatians, and Christ the Pharisees and his 
disciples fools in the Gospel. So that you may know 
how Solomon does not speak of bad or lowly people 
when he speaks of fools, but of the best in the world. 
For Solomon, "wisdom" here means nothing other 
than God's wisdom, which is taught in God's words 
and works. That is why he always refers to God's 
commandment and work. In addition, all proverbs 
have no other origin than God's word and work, 
because all people's suggestions are vain and false, 
and do not come out differently than God wills and 
does. It is like saying in German: Es ist dir bedacht, 
aber nicht bescheret. Item: He who is fortunate leads 
the bride home. And such things do not come from 
anywhere, because one has seen and had to grasp 
how people's ideas and hopes are always lacking, 
and turn out differently than one thinks, and in the 
end must realize that someone else is driving the 
little wheel. Some call this God, some call it luck. 
Therefore, the proverbs in all tongues and languages 
are true and certain, as those of God. 





work, and come from God's work, whether God's 
word is already not there. Again, "foolishness" is 
what he calls everything that goes without God's 
word and work; and a "wise man" who is according 
to God's word and work; a "fool" who is 
presumptuous according to his own mind and 
conceit. 

4 From this we see what an excellent, wise and 
fine man King Solomon is, who has made it so hard 
for him that, among so many royal affairs, he has 
taken upon himself the office of a teacher, and 
especially the most necessary, namely, to teach and 
train the youth how to act blessedly before God 
according to the spirit, and wisely before the world 
with body and good. For therein lies the greatest 
power to have people on earth, as this King Solomon 
well saw; whom one cannot have, but draw them in 
youth. Therefore, this booklet should be presented to 
the youth in time, and it should be brought into daily 
use and practice. For the sake of which things, 
without a doubt, King Solomon has made and written 
this, as an example to all kings and lords, that they 
should also take care of the youth. God grant his 
mercy. Amen. 


8, preface from Ecclesiastes, 


1524. 


1 This book is called Koheleth in Hebrew, which is 
one who speaks publicly in a congregation. For Kahal 
means a congregation gathered together, which in 
Greek is called Ekklesia. Of course, the book was not 
written or compiled by King Solomon himself with his 
own hand, but was heard from his mouth by others 
and summarized by the scholars; as they themselves 
confess at the end when they say [Cap. 12, 11.These 
words of the wise men are spears and nails, made by 
the masters of the church, and given by one 
shepherd,” that is, some chosen ones were ordained 
at that time by kings and people to read these and 
other books by Solomon, the one shepherd, 





to arrange and order them in such a way that not 
everyone has to make books as he desires; just as 
there they also complain that there is no end to 
bookmaking, and forbid others to accept them. 

Such people call themselves "masters of the 
church", so that the books must be accepted and 
confirmed by their hand and office. For the Jewish 
people had an external regiment, appointed by God, 
so that this could be done well, surely and rightly. So 
also this book of the Proverbs of Solomon is put 
together by others, and at the back of it some wise 
men's teachings and sayings are added. Item, the 
Song of Solomon also stands as a book divided from 
others. 


32 en. 63, 41-43. prefaces to the German Bible translation. W. xiv, 36-W. 33 





Solomon's mouth. Therefore, there is no order in 
these books, but one is mixed into the other, as they 
have not heard it all at once, nor at one time from him; 
as must be the nature of such books. 

Now this book should have the title that it is written 
against free will. For it shows that all men's counsels, 
plans and undertakings are in vain and futile, and 
always turn out differently than we will and think; so 
that he may teach us to 1) stand still, and let God 
alone do all things over, against, and without our 
knowledge and counsel. Therefore, you must not 
understand this book as if it reproaches God's 
creatures when it says: it is all vain and pitiful 2c., 
because God's creatures are all good, Gen. 1, 31. 
and 1 Tim. 4, 4. 


1) In the original: learn. 





It is not that a man should have good courage with 
his wife and need life, but that the plans and 
undertakings of men to deal with creatures are all 
lacking and in vain, if one does not allow oneself to 
be satisfied with what is present in one's hands, but 
wants to master and rule them in the future. In this 
way, it always goes the way of cancer, that one has 
had no more than wasted care and effort, and still 
happens what God wants and thinks, not what we 
want and think. Summa, as Christ says, Matth. 6, 34: 
"Do not worry about the morrow, for the morrow will 
have its own worries; it is enough that every day has 
its evil." This saying is the gloss and content of this 
book. Worrying for us belongs to God; our worrying 
is a waste of time and effort. 





9, preface to the prophets. *) 


1532. 


It seems to reason that the prophets are of little 
use, especially when Master Kligel, who knows the 
holy scriptures by heart and on the nails, comes upon 
them; out of the great wealth of his mind, he regards 
them as vain, lazy, deadly laundry. This means that 
the history and the work are no longer before the 
eyes, and only the words or histories are heard. 
Which is no wonder that even now God's word is 
despised, although the signs and history, as well as 
the kingdom of Christ, still stand and walk daily 
before our eyes. How much more should it be 
despised if history and deeds were no longer 
present. Just as the children of Israel despised God 
and his word, when they still had before their eyes 
the bread of heaven, the fiery pillar and the light 
cloud, and both the priesthood and the principality 
2c. 

2 Therefore, we Christians should not be such 
shameful, unthankful, ungrateful wretches. 





but read and use the prophets with seriousness and 
benefit. First of all, they proclaim and testify to 
Christ's kingdom, in which we now live, and all 
believers in Christ have lived until now, and will live 
until the end of the world. 

(3) And this is a great comfort and strength for us, 
that we have such powerful and ancient witnesses 
for our Christian life, by which our Christian faith is 
greatly comforted, that it is the right standing before 
God, against all other unrighteous, false, human 
holiness and cults, which for the sake of their great 
appearance and the multitudes who cling to them, 
again also for the sake of the cross and the few who 
hold to the Christian faith, greatly anger and 
challenge a weak heart. As in our time, the Turks, the 
Pabst and other mobs give us great, tremendous 
annoyances. 

4. that the prophets are good for us, as St. Peter 
praises, 1 Petr. 1, 12. that the

appeared in 1532 in the fourth part of the translation of the Old Tesfament, which has the title: Die Propheten alle deutsch.

W. XIV, 38-41. 35 





The prophets did not reveal to themselves what was 
revealed to them, but to us they revealed it. For they 
have thus ministered unto us in their prophecies, that 
whosoever would be in Christ's kingdom should 
know, and should walk according to it, that he must 
first suffer many things, before he come unto glory. 
That we may be assured of both these things, that 
the great glory of Christ's kingdom is certainly ours, 
and that it will come afterward; but that before it 
comes the cross, shame, misery, contempt, and all 
kinds of suffering for Christ's sake, so that through 
impatience or unbelief we may not be despondent, 
nor despair of the glory to come, which will be so 
great that even the angels will desire to see it. 

(5) Secondly, they show us many and great 

examples and experience of the first commandment, 
and they expound it masterfully, both with words and 
examples, so that they may drive us mightily to the 
fear of God and to faith, and keep us in it. For after 
they have prophesied of Christ's kingdom, the other 
is all vain examples of how God has confirmed His 
first commandment so severely and harshly; that it is 
certainly no different to read or hear the prophets, 
than to read and hear God's preaching and 
comforting. Comfort the wicked, who are secure and 
proud, and where the comforting does not help, 
presses on_ with punishments, _ pestilence, 
destruction, war, until they perish, and thus makes 
His comforting in the first commandment true. But 
comfort the godly, who are in all kinds of trouble, and 
also press on with help and counsel, by all kinds of 
miracles and signs, against all the power of the devil 
and the world, and thus also make his comforting in 
the first commandment true. 
With such sermons and examples the dear prophets 
serve us abundantly. That we should not be angry 
when we see how surely and proudly the wicked 
despise God's word, and give nothing at all for His 
forbearance, as if God Himself were nothing at all. 
For in the prophets we see how no one has fared well 
who has despised God's word, even if it were the 
most powerful emperors and kings, or the most holy 
and learned people, whom the sun had shone upon. 
And again, how no one is abandoned who relies on 
God's consolations and promises. 





even if they were the most wretched and poorest 
sinners and beggars who came to earth; yes, even if 
they were Habet who was killed and Jonah who was 
devoured. For the prophets prove to us that God 
keeps His first commandment, and wants to be a 
merciful father of the poor and faithful, and none shall 
be too small nor too despised for Him; again, a 
wrathful judge over the wicked and proud, and none 
shall be too great, too mighty, too wise, too holy for 
Him, be He emperor, pope, Turk and devil to boot. 

(7) And for this reason the dear prophets are 
useful and necessary for us to read in our time, so 
that we may be strengthened and comforted with 
such examples and sermons’ against the 
unspeakable, innumerable, and, if God wills it, the 
very last astonishments of the damned world. For 
how utterly nothing does the Turk consider our Lord 
Jesus Christ and his kingdom in comparison to 
himself and his Mahomet! How utterly despised on 
this side, among us and among the papacy, is the 
dear poor Gospel and God's Word, compared to the 
glorious appearance and riches of human 
commandments and holiness! How surely do the 
pagans, epicures, and others of their ilk, with their 
own conceit, go against the holy Scriptures! How 
very impudently and savagely everyone now lives 
according to his will, against the bright truth, so now 
in the day that it seems as if neither God nor Christ 
were anything, keep silent, that God's first 
commandment should be so strict. 

(8) But it is said, Wait, wait; what matter if the 
prophets lie and deceive us with their histories and 
sermons? Mightier and more powerful kings have 
perished, and worse men have perished; neither 
shall they escape. Again, there have been poorer 
and more miserable people, who nevertheless have 
been wonderfully helped; we will not be abandoned 
either. They are not the first ones who have defied 
and throbbed. Neither are we the first to have 
suffered and been afflicted. Behold, therefore, let us 
make use of the prophets, and they shall be fruitfully 
read. 

(9) But that there is more in it of forbidding and 
punishing, neither of comforting nor of promising, is 


36 Erl. 63, 45-48. 
to reckon well the cause. For the wicked are always 
more than the pious. Therefore, the law must always 
be practiced much more than the promises, because 
the wicked are secure without it, and are almost quick 
to interpret the divine consolations and promises from 
themselves, and to interpret the pressure and 
punishment on others, and do not let themselves be 
turned away from such a wrong sense and false hope 


in any way. For their rhyme is: Pax et securitas, there 
is no need [1 Thess. 5, 3]. They stay there, and go 
along with it to destruction, as St. Paul says there: 
"Suddenly destruction comes upon them. 


Idolatry among the Jews. 


(10) Further, because the prophets cry out 
most about idolatry, it is necessary to know what form 
their idolatry took. For among us under the papacy 
many tickle themselves very gently, and think that 
they are not such idolaters as the children of Israel. 
That is why they do not pay much attention to the 
prophets, especially in this piece, as they are not 
concerned with their punishments for idolatry. They 
are far too pure and holy to practice idolatry, and it 
would be ridiculous for them to fear or be frightened 
by the chastisement and rebuke of idolatry. Just as 
the people of Israel also did, and would not believe 
that they were idolatrous, and the  prophets' 
prophecies had to be all lies, and they had to be 
condemned as heretics. The children of Israel were 
not such great saints that they worshipped wood and 
stones, especially the kings, princes, priests and 
prophets, who were the most idolatrous. But this was 
their idolatry, that they abandoned the worship that 
had been established and ordered in Jerusalem (and 
wherever God wanted it more), and out of their own 
devotion and conceit, without God's command, they 
improved, established and organized it elsewhere, 
and invented other new ways, persons and times for 
it, which Moses had forbidden them quite severely, 
especially Deut. 12:4,8, and always pointed them to 
the place that God had chosen for His tabernacle and 
dwelling place. Such false devotion was their idolatry, 
and they thought it was delicious and relied on it,

as if they had done well, when it was all disobedience 
and apostasy from God and His command. 

011 So we read in 1 Kings 12:28, that Jeroboam 
did not badly set up the two calves, but preached 
beside them unto the people, saying, Ye shall go up 
no more unto Jerusalem; but, behold, Israel, here is 
thy God, which brought thee out of Egypt. He does 
not say, Behold here, Israel, this is a calf, but: is your 
GOOD who brought you out of Egypt. Confess freely 
that the God of Israel is the true God, and that he 
brought them out of Egypt; but do not run after him to 
Jerusalem, but find him here in Dan and Bethel 1) 
among the golden calves. So that the opinion is that 
one can sacrifice and serve God before the golden 
calves, as before a holy sign of God, just as one 
served and sacrificed God before the golden ark in 
Jerusalem. Behold, this is to forsake the worship of 
Jerusalem, and to deny God, who commanded such 
worship, as if He had not commanded it? 

012 And so they built upon their own works and 
devotions, and not upon God pure and alone. With 
such devotion they then filled the land with idolatry on 
every mountain, in every ground, under every tree, 
building altars, sacrificing and burning incense, and 
yet all had to be called serving God Israel. Whoever 
said otherwise was a heretic and a false prophet. For 
this actually means to commit idolatry, to perform a 
service without God's command, out of one's own 
devotion. For he wants to be unmastered by us, how 
to serve him. He wants to teach us and preach to us, 
his word should be there, it should shine and guide 
us. Without his word everything is idolatry and vain 
lies, however devout and beautiful it may be. We 
have often written about this. 


Idolatrous among Christians. 


(13) From this it follows that among us Christians 
all those are idolatrous, and the prophets’ rebuke 
truly concerns them, who have invented or still hold 
new worship services,

without God's command and commandment, out of 
their own devotion and (as they say) good opinion. 
For in this way they certainly put their trust in their 
own chosen works, and not only and purely in Jesus 
Christ. This is what the prophets call adulteresses, 
who are not content with their husband Christ, but go 
after others as well, as if Christ alone could not help 
us without us and our works, or as if he had not only 
redeemed us, but we also had to do it, knowing full 
well that we did nothing at all to help him die for us, 
take our sin upon himself, and bear it on the cross, 
not only before all the world could know it, but also 
before we were born: as little, and much less, did the 
children of Israel do to afflict Egypt and Pharaoh, and 
to set them free by the death of the first Egyptian 
birth, which God did alone, and they did nothing 
everywhere. 

014 Yea, they say, the children of Israel served 
idols with their worship, and not the right God: but we 
serve the right God in our churches, and the one Lord 
Jehovah Christ; for we know of no idols. Answer: So 
said the children of Israel also, and said all together 
that all their worship was done unto the right God, and 
would not suffer it to be called serving idols, much 
less than our ministers would suffer it, and they also 
struck dead at it, and persecuted all true prophets. 
For they truly did not want to know about any idols, 
as the histories well indicate. 


15 For so we read in Judges. 17:2 that Micah's 
mother, when he had taken from her the thousand 
and hundred pieces of silver and given them back, 
said to him, "Blessed be my son to the LORD! | have 
pledged such silver to the Lord," that my son should 
take it from me and make an idol and an image out of 
it 2c. Here one hears clearly and certainly that the 
mother means the right God, to whom she has 
pledged such silver, that an idol and image would be 
made out of it. For she does not say, "| have pledged 
such silver to an idol," but "to the Lord," which word 
is known among all the Jews, that it means the one 
true 





God is called. Just as the Turk does, and by his 
worship calls and means the right God, who created 
heaven and earth. Likewise the Jews, the Tatars, and 
now all unbelievers. Nevertheless, with them 
everything is vain idolatry. 

Item, the great man Gideon, how strangely he fell. 
Judges. 8:23, who just as he said to the children of 
Israel (who wanted him and his children to be their 
lord), "I will not be your lord, nor will my children be 
your lord, but the LORD (that is, the true God) shall 
be your lord,” nevertheless took the jewels 1) that 
they gave him, and yet made them neither image nor 
altar, but only priestly garments [v. 27], and also 
wanted to have a worship service in his city out of 
devotion. The Scripture still says that all Israel 
committed fornication with it, and that his hall 
perished because of it. Now the great holy man did 
not mean an idol, but the right and only God, as the 
fine, witty words testify, where he says: "The Lord 
shall rule over you, and not I," 2c., so that he clearly 
gives the honor to God alone, and confesses and 
wants to have the right God alone as one God and 
Lord. Thus we have heard above that King Jeroboam 
did not call his golden calves idols, but the God of 
Israel, who had led them out of Egypt, which is the 
true one God; for no idol had led them out of Egypt. 
Nor was it his opinion that he wanted to worship idols, 
but because he feared (as the text says, v. 26, 27) 
that his people would fall away from him to the king 
of Judah, where they would worship at Jerusalem 
alone, he invented a worship of his own, so that he 
would keep them to himself, and nevertheless meant 
by this the right God who dwelt at Jerusalem, but it 
would not be necessary to serve God at Jerusalem 
alone. 

(17) And what may it say? God Himself confesses 
that the children of Israel did not mean an idol by their 
worship, but Him alone. For thus he speaks Hos. 2, 
16. f.: "Then, says the LORD, you will call me my 
husband, and you will no longer call me my Baal. For 
| will call the names of the Baalim 


1) In the original: nevertheless he took the gems 2c. 


40 Erl. 63, 51 p. 59 p. Prefaces to the German translation of the Bible. W.XIV, 46-48. 


41 





from their mouths, that such names of Baalim be 
remembered no more." Here one must confess that 
it is true that the children of Israel did not mean an 
idol by their worship, but the one true God, as here 
in Hosea God clearly says: "You will no longer call 
me my Baal." Now ever Baal was the greatest, 
meanest, most glorious worship in the people of 
Israel. It was still vain idolatry, regardless of the fact 
that they meant the right God by it. 

(18) Therefore, it does not help our clergy to 
pretend that they do not serve any idols in their 
churches and foundations, but only God, the true 
Lord. For you hear here that it is not enough to say 
or think: | do it in honor of God; | mean the right God; 
item: | want to serve the one God, because all 
idolaters also say and mean this. It is not a matter of 
my opinion or of my own, otherwise they would also 
be God's servants, who martyred the apostles and 
Christians, because they also thought (as Christ says 
Joh. 16, 2.) that they were doing God a service; and 
St. Paul Rom. 10, 2. gives testimony to the Jews that 
they are jealous for God, and Apost. 26, 7. says that 
they hope with worship day and night to come to the 
promised blessedness. 





(19) But let every man take care that he may be 
sure that his worship is instituted by the word of God, 
and not invented or well-meant out of his own 
devotion. For whoever worships without God's 
testimony should know that he is not serving the right 
God, but his own invented idol, that is, his own 
conceit and false thoughts, and thus the devil 
himself, and the words of all the prophets go against 
him. For such a God is nowhere, who wants to 
establish worship for him out of our own choice and 
devotion, without his command and word; but there 
is only One God, who through his word has 
abundantly established and commanded all kinds of 
stands and worship, in which he wants to have 
served him. 

(20) We are to stay with this, and not turn from it 
to the right or to the left, neither doing more nor less, 
neither doing worse nor better. Otherwise there will 
be no end to idolatry, and no distinction can be made 
between what is right worship and what is idolatry, 
because they all mean the right God, and all need 
His right name. To the same one God be 
thanksgiving and praise, through Jesus Christ, His 
Son and our Lord, eternally given, amen.

1532. 


1 To understand the prophet Jeremiah, it must not 

take much gloss, if one only looks at the stories that 
happened among the kings, at which time he 
preached. For the way things were in the land at that 
time is also the way his sermons go. 
First, the land was full of vice and idolatry, strangled 
the prophets, and wanted their vice and idolatry 
unpunished. Therefore, the first part is almost a vain 
punishment. 


and lamentation over the wickedness of the Jews, up 
to the twentieth chapter. 

3) On the other hand, he also prophesies the 
punishment that existed, namely the destruction of 
Jerusalem and the whole country, and the 
Babylonian prison, even the punishment of all the 
Gentiles. And yet, in addition, he comforts and 
promises a certain, definite time, after such 
punishment, redemption and return to the land and 
to Jerusalem 2c.

(4) And this piece is the most distinguished in 
Jeremiah. For it is for this that Jeremiah is awakened, 
as the vision of the valiant rod and boiling pots 
coming from midnight in the first chapter indicates. 

(5) And this was very necessary. Because such a 
terrible plague was to come upon the people, so that 
they would be torn apart and led away from their 
land, the pious hearts, as Daniel and many others, 
would have had to despair of God and all His 
promises, as they could not have thought otherwise 
than that it was all over with them, and that they 
would be utterly rejected by God, that no Christ 
would ever come, but God would have withdrawn His 
promise in great wrath because of the sin of the 
people. Therefore Jeremiah had to be there and 
proclaim the punishment and the wrath so that they 
would not last forever, but for a certain time, as 
seventy years, and after that they would come again 
to grace. 

(6) Whatever promise he had to comfort himself 
with and maintain himself with, he otherwise did not 
have much comfort nor good days. For he was a 
miserable, afflicted prophet, who lived in miserable, 
evil times, and also led an excellently difficult 
preaching ministry, when he had to scold evil, stiff- 
necked people for over forty years, until he was 
imprisoned, and yet was able to create little benefit, 
but saw that the longer they got the angrier, and 
always wanted to kill him, and caused him much 
trouble. 

(7) Moreover, he had to experience and see with 
his eyes the destruction of the land and the 
imprisonment of the people, and much great sorrow 
and bloodshed. Without what he then had to preach 
and suffer in Egypt. For it is believed that he was 
stoned by the Jews in Egypt. 

8) Third, like other prophets, he prophesies about 
Christ and his kingdom, especially in the 23rd and 
31st chapters, where he prophesies very clearly 
about the person of Christ, about his kingdom, about 
the New Testament, and about the end of the Old 
Testament. But these three pieces do not follow one 
another in order, and are not separated from one 
another in the 

1) "can", which is missing in the original, is inserted after the Weimar 
Bible. 





The first chapter often contains something in the 
following chapter that was not done before. Yes, in 
the first chapter there is often something in the 
following chapter that has happened before, neither 
that in the previous chapter, so that it looks as if 
Jeremiah did not put such books together himself, 
but rather that they were composed piecemeal from 
his speech and written down in the book. Therefore 
one must not turn to order, and not let disorder 
hinder. 

(9) We learn from Jeremiah, among other things, 
that the closer the punishment, the angrier the 
people become, and the more they are preached to, 
the more they despise it, and that when God wants 
to punish, he takes hold of them and makes them 
stubborn, so that they may perish without mercy and 
not atone for God's wrath with any repentance. Thus 
the people of Sodom not only despised the pious Lot, 
but, because he taught them, they also afflicted him, 
and yet their plague was at the door. Pharaoh, when 
he was about to be drowned in the Red Sea, had to 
torture the children of Israel twice as much as before. 
And Jerusalem also had to crucify God's Son, since 
her final destruction was coming. 

(10) This is also the case now everywhere. Now 
that the end of the world is approaching, people are 
raging and raging against God in the most terrible 
way, blaspheming and condemning God's word, 
which they know to be God's word and the truth. In 
addition, so many terrible signs and wonders appear, 
both in the sky and almost in all creatures, which 
threaten them terribly, and is also such an evil, 
miserable time, and even worse than Jeremiah's 
time. 

11. but it will and must be so, that they become 


sure and sing: Pax, it has no need; and only pursues 
everything that God wants, and all the threatening of 
the signs is thrown to the wind, until (as St. Paul 
says) suddenly the destruction hastens and disturbs 
them before they become aware of it. 

(12) But Christ will know how to keep His own, for 
whose sake He makes His word shine in this 
shameful time, as He kept Daniel and his like at 
Babylon, for whose sake Jeremiah's prophecy had to 
shine. To the same dear Lord be praise and 
thanksgiving, together with the Father and the Holy 
Spirit, one God above all and forever, amen.

11. preface from the prophets Ezekiel, *) 


1532. 


Ezekiel went with King Jechansa, like Daniel and 
others, willingly to the prison of Babylon, according to 
the counsel of Jeremiah, because he always advised 
them to surrender to the king of Babylon, so they 
would live and should not resist, otherwise they 
would perish, Jer. 21:8, 9. 

002 Now when they were come to Babylon, as 
Jeremiah saith, Cap. 24:6, and comforted them 
kindly, impatience set in, and they repented 
exceedingly that they had surrendered, because they 
saw that they that remained at Jerusalem, and had 
not surrendered, yet held both the city and all things, 
and hoped to make Jeremiah a liar, and to defend 
themselves before the king of Babylon, and to remain 
in the land. 

(3) The false prophets, who always comforted 
Jerusalem as if Jerusalem would not be won, helped 
confidently, and Jeremiah had to lie as a heretic and 
apostate. Thus it came to pass (as it is wont to do) 
that those at Jerusalem boasted as those who held 
honestly and firmly to God and the fatherland; but 
those had surrendered and forsaken God together 
with the fatherland, as the faithless and treacherous, 
who could neither trust nor hope in God, but joined 
their enemies, because of such loose speech of 
Jeremiah the liar 2c. This bit and embittered those 
who had surrendered to Babylon, and their prison 
was now twofold. Oh, how many a woman's curse 
they must have wished on Jeremiah, whom they had 
followed, and he had so miserably deceived them. 

4 Therefore God raised up this prophet Ezekiel at 
Babylon to comfort the captives and to prophesy 
against the false prophets at Jerusalem, and to 
confirm Jeremiah's word. Which he also does 
honestly, and prophesies much harder and more, 
how Jerusalem should be destroyed, and the people 
perish with kings and princes; and yet promises 
under it the

in the Weimar Bible (1686). 





Return and return to the land of Judah. And this is the 
most distinguished piece in Ezekiel, which he 
practiced in his time, and carries on to the twenty-fifth 
chapter. 

5 After this he extends his prophecy to all the 
other countries around, which were also to be 
plagued by the king of Babylon, until the thirty-fourth 
chapter. Then follow four chapters about the spirit 
and kingdom of Christ. Then about the last tyrant in 
the kingdom of Christ, Gog and Magog. And at the 
end he rebuilds Jerusalem and comforts the people 
that they will come home again. But in the spirit he 
means the eternal city, the heavenly Jerusalem, of 
which Revelation also speaks [Cap. 21, 2]. 


A lesson on how to understand the vision of 
Ezekiel from the chariot Cap. 1 and 10. 2) 


6 St. Jerome and others write: That it was 
forbidden among the Jews, and still is, to read the first 
and last parts of the prophet Ezekiel before a man is 
thirty years old, and thus also the first chapter of 
Moses in the first book. 

7 There should not be such a prohibition among 
the Jews, because Isaiah Cap. 29, 11. prophesies 
that the whole holy scripture is sealed and closed to 
the unbelieving Jews, as St. Paul 2 Cor. 3, 14. also 
says that the cover of Moses remains over the 
scripture as long as they do not believe in Christ. 

(8) This is also proved by the work, for they tear 
and grind up the Scriptures in their interpretations, as 
foul swine grind up and turn back a pleasure garden, 
so that one would wish that they would remain 
unsworn to the Scriptures. Even though many of our 
people cling so firmly to the rabbis, and trust them 
that they

determination. The Erlangen edition gives the year 1545 in the

more than the ancient Jews themselves did. 

9. but this vision of Ezekiel in the first part is 
nothing else, to my mind (another make it better), but 
a revelation of the kingdom of Christ in faith here on 
earth, in all four places of the whole world, Ps. 19, 5: 


In omnem terram [exivit sonus eorum]. For no 
prophet can be (as St. Peter s2 Petr. 1, 21.] testifies), 
unless he has the Spirit of Christ. But to interpret all 
the pieces is too long in a preface. To say briefly: This 
face is the spiritual chariot of Christ, on which he rides 
here in the world, that is his whole holy Christianity. 
There are four beasts, which he calls cherubim (for 
he sits, rides and drives on cherubim, as the 
Scriptures often report), each of which has four faces, 
and stand, like four steeds, in the fours, but inwardly 
and between the wheels. There are also four four- 
wheeled horses around the animals, one wheel for 
each animal, so that they can go to the four places of 
the world, that is, in front of them, behind them and 
on both sides, and yet they must not steer. 

In the same way, animals walk on round feet 
toward the four places of the world and are not 
allowed to steer. Here there is no axle, no saddle, no 
frame, no lunges, no ladder, no scales, no ropes, no 
cords, but the spirit within drives it all. Above is the 
sky, like a horse blanket, and a chair inside for the 
saddle, on which God, that is, Christ sits. 

(11) So the four wheels go together; for all the 
churches in the four places of the world, that is, in the 
whole world, have the same, one, united course in 
faith, hope, love, cross and all spiritual things: Faith, 
hope, love, cross and all spiritual: being. And they are 
not made from the outside, by. They are not driven 
from the outside by the teachings of men, but from 
within by one spirit, Rom. 8, 9. 1 Cor. 12, 5. Eph. 4, 4. 
12. and the four beasts also go with the wheels, or 
rather the wheels with them, before them, behind 
them, above them, and on either side. For the 
apostles, or the ministry of preaching, the word of 
God, baptism, sacrament, keys, and what belongs to 
the spiritual regiment of the church, are also one, 
equal and of one accord in all the world. Thus the 
beasts and the wheels hold together firmly and surely, 
that there is one 


Chariot is, without all outward binding, harnessing or 
stretching, that everything is four, four animals, four 
faces of an animal, four feet of an animal, four hands 
of an animal, four wings of an animal, four wheels, 
four rims on a wheel. Means, as_ said, that 
Christianity, or the kingdom of Christ, should go in 
faith in the four places, that is, in the whole world. 

13) But such a vision meant (as Ezekiel himself 
shows here, Cap. 8. 9) the end and destruction of the 
synagogue, or Judaism, that is, the priesthood, 
worship and church order, given and established to 
them by Moses, all of which was established no 
further than Christ's future, as St. Paul Rom. 8, 3. 
Paul Rom. 8, 3. 2 Cor. 3, 6. and Matth. 11, 13. Christ 
himself says, and the epistle to the Hebrews 
abundantly deals with it; at which the Jews have 
been grievously vexed and offended until this day. 

14 And this is to be known specially, against the 
blindness of the Jews, that all the prophecy, which 
saith that Israel and Judah shall return into their land, 
and shall possess the same in the flesh for ever, is 
fulfilled long since, that the hope of the Jews is utterly 
vain and lost. For this prophecy has two parts. 

015 The first, that Israel and Judah should come 
again into the land after their captivity, which was 
done by Cyrum the king and Persia before the birth 
of Christ, when the Jews came again out of all 
countries into the land, and into Jerusalem; and out 
of foreign countries also, as they dwelt, they came 
yearly unto the feasts of Jerusalem, and drew many 
nations with them, and to themselves. 

16 But that the Jews hope that there will be 
another, bodily return, when they all return to the 
land, and raise up Moses with the old nature, they 
themselves dream, and no letter of it is spoken or 
signified in the prophets, nor in the Scriptures. It is 
written that they shall come again out of all the lands 
whither they are driven, but not all, but some out of 
all the lands. There is a great difference between all 
the Jews coming back and coming back from all the 
countries. To return from all the countries is fulfilled; 
but to return from all the Jews is never fulfilled.

but the antitype. Just as in Jerusalem, when it was 
still standing, both before and after the prison, they 
were not all God's people, but the devil's people, 
idolatrous murderers, and the worst people on earth. 

17) The other part and the very best (which the 
Jews do not want to see nor respect) in the same 
prophecy is that God promises to create a new thing 
in the land, and to make a new covenant, not like the 
old covenant of Moses (which they dream of), as it is 
clearly written in Jer. 31:33, and in many other 
places, that they will no longer be two kingdoms, but 
one kingdom, under their future king David, and will 
be one kingdom forever, even in the same physical 
land. 

(18) This piece also is fulfilled. For when Christ 
came, and found the people gathered together 
again, both of Israel and Judah, out of all the 
countries, and the land full, he began the new things, 
and made the promised new covenant. And this he 
did, not in a spiritual place, nor in any other fleshly 
place, but in the same fleshly land of Canaan, and in 
the same fleshly Jerusalem, as it was promised, 
whither they were brought again out of all the earth. 

019 And when they would not, or ever would not 

much accept the same covenant, it remained 
nevertheless an everlasting covenant, not only at 
Jerusalem, and in the same land, but also departed 
thence into all the four corners of the earth, and 
remaineth this day, both at Jerusalem, and in all 
places. For the place Jerusalem is still there, and 
Christ is Lord and King there, as in all the world, 
helping and hearing all who are there, or come there, 
as in all the world, meanwhile letting Mahomet with 
his tyranny, and the pope with his jugglery, do what 
they do; he is and remains Lord over all. 
020 That the Jews now stand fast upon the name 
Israel, and boast that they alone are Israel, but we 
are Gentiles, is true according to the first part, and 
according to the old covenant of Moses, which is now 
long fulfilled. But according to the second part and 
the new covenant they are no longer Israel, for all 
things are to be new, and Israel must also become 
new. And only those are the right Israel, which the 
new covenant 


(founded and started in Jerusalem). 

21 For according to the old covenant | am not an 
Israel nor a Jew, but now | boast that | am the son of 
St. Paul, and an Israel or Benjamin, for he is my 
father; not the old Paul, but the new Paul, who is the 
same old Paul, but from the old Paul became a new 
Paul in Christ, and begat me in Christ through the 
gospel, that | might be like him according to the new 
covenant. So all Gentiles who are Christians are true 
Israelites and new Jews, born of Christ, the noblest 
Jew. Therefore it all depends on the new covenant, 
which the Messiah should establish and make all 
things new, as he has done. 

(22) And this rule is well to be remembered. For 
where the prophets speak of Israel, that he should 
return in whole or be gathered together, as Mich. 2, 
12. Ezek. 20, 40, and the like, this is certainly spoken 
of the new covenant and the new Israel, since not one 
will remain outside the eternal kingdom of Christ. But 
it is not possible to understand it of the old Israel, 
because several parts remained in Assyria and 
Babylon, both dead and alive, and very few returned, 
as Ezra counted them all. 

23. but the Jews want to have the Messiah 
according to the old covenant, and do not respect this 
new covenant. So they lack both, hovering between 
heaven and earth. They do not want the new; they 
cannot have the old. Therefore also the scripture is 
sealed to them, Isa. 29, 10. 11., and they do not 
understand a prophet. And sit thus, without 
government, both bodily and spiritual. They have not 
the bodily and the earthly (for they have no king, nor 
lord, nor kingdom, nor principality). They do not have 
the spiritual either, because they do not want to 
accept the new covenant and therefore have to 
remain without priesthood. Summa, they not only 
despised this new covenant, but also persecuted it, 
and wanted to destroy it and not live, and have been 
destroyed with their covenant. 

(24) And though Jerusalem might have remained 
with all the old substance, yet the new covenant must 
come and make all things new, to fulfill the Scriptures 
as it was written.

now in Christendom, namely, that in Jernsalem there 
should have been an apostle, bishop or preacher, as 
Christ Himself began, who there should have 
governed the church of Christ, preached the gospel, 
baptized, administered the sacrament, absolved, 
bound 2c. If it had not been the high priest Caiphas 
or another, it would have had to be an apostle, or the 
descendants of the apostles; as it has happened until 
now, and must happen, and therefore the eternal 
kingdom of Christ would also reign in the old 
Jerusalem, as well as in all the world, as the 
prophecy had promised and wants to have, and 
therefore the old kingdom of Moses would have 
remained there, as a worldly regime. 

(25) Just as in all the world the old, temporal, 
worldly regime remains, and nothing prevents the 
new, spiritual, eternal regime and kingdom of Christ 
being established on earth under it and in it, and 
having its own nature, as we see before our eyes; 
especially where there are pious kings and princes 
who suffer such a new, eternal kingdom of Christ in 
their old regime, or even accept it, promote it and 
want to be in it as Christians. Otherwise, several 
kings, princes and lords of the old regime are just as 
poisonously bitterly hostile to the new covenant and 
kingdom of Christ, and persecute it and want to 
destroy it, as the Jews in Jerusalem; they also go to 
the ground over it, as happened to Rome, and will 
happen to others. For Christ's new kingdom must 
remain, because it is promised to be an eternal 
kingdom, and the old kingdom must perish at last. 

26 And it is good to reckon, because God Himself 

calls such a kingdom a new kingdom, so it must be a 
much more glorious kingdom, neither the old one has 
been or still is, and God has been willing to make 
much a better one, neither the old one is. And if there 
were no other glory here, this alone is glorious 
enough beyond all measure, that it should be an 
eternal kingdom, which does not cease, like the old 
or worldly kingdom. 
27. now these immeasurable, glorious goods are in 
it, forgiveness of sins, peace with god, safety from 
eternal death and all evil, fellowship of divine 
majesty, of all angels and saints, joy and delight in all 
creatures, even after the body. For this same body, 
which is now the old body, shall be 





also become new together with all creatures, just as 
the soul has begun to become new in faith. 

Therefore the Jews do themselves injustice and 
harm, because they do not desire the new kingdom 
through Messiah, but just the previous, old, 
perishable kingdom, in which silver, gold, goods, 
power, honor, pleasure and joy are possessed 
according to mortal flesh, which are of no value at all 
before God. For if he had promised such a kingdom, 
he would not have called it a new, different and better 
kingdom. 

(29) And above this world's goods there can be 
nothing else, nothing new, nothing better, except the 
spiritual, eternal, blessed goods in heaven, under 
which there can be no evil or wickedness. But under 
the earthly, old, temporal bars, even if they were as 
glorious as the Jews dream of their Messiah, there 
must be and remain much evil and much evil 
underneath, least of all the death and end of such 
goods. 

30 Ezekiel also teaches us these two things, that 
he comforts the people about the return from 
Babylon, but prophesies much more about the new 
Israel and kingdom of Christ. This is his face from the 
chariot, and almost also his temple at the last part of 
his book. 


To teach how to understand the building of 
Ezekiel in the last nine chapters, from the 
fortieth to the end of the prophets. 


(31) Whoever wants to understand this building of 
the temple, altar, city and land, as Ezekiel describes 
here, must take Lyram before him, with its figures and 
glosses, otherwise he will labor and work in vain. And 
because we do not know how to put the figure on 
paper better, we have left it standing, and directed 
the reader to Lyra; for it is also not possible to design 
a building on paper, but [one] would have to make a 
carved pattern. 

32 But what it means, the teachers have thought, 
one otherwise, the other so. But above all the Jews 
and their kind are to be rejected, who think that it is 
to be the third temple, which is to be built by their 
future Messiah, and boast much and much about it.

53 





great glory of it, in their foolish, vain hope, and do not 
see, the blind and coarse people, that the text cannot 
suffer such their dreams, as Lyra also mightily 
reproves. For Ezekiel does not say that this city 
should be called Jerusalem, nor that it should stand 
in the place where Jerusalem is situated, which is on 
the north side of the mountain, and the temple is in 
the midst of it on the hill of Moriah, and the castle of 
Zion is on the south side. 

033 But this city of Ezekiel shall lie toward the 
south, and shall be called Dominus ibi, where God 
is, or God there, that is, where God himself is. And 
the temple shall not be within, but, as the reckoning 
gives, about seven good great German miles from 
the city toward the north. And the city on the high 
mountain shall have nine good, large, German miles, 
both in length and breadth, so that the circular wall 
reaches around and around thirty-six German miles; 
that may be called a little city, and a little mountain, 
on which it lies. 

(34) Now if a citizen, living at the end of the city at 
noon, would go to the church or temple, he would 
have to go sixteen miles, as nine through the city, 
and then seven to the temple. Such an inconsistent 
thing the blind Jews do not see, that it cannot be a 
physical building, much less in the place where 
Jerusalem is located, as they falsely hope. 

35. also a great water shall flow within out of the 
temple into the dead sea (which the Papists sing of 
their holy water, as the fools), which rhymeth in no 
wise with the land of Israel. 





(36) The tribes and the land of Israel are also 
divided and arranged much differently and further, so 
that the city and the temple are not to be in any tribe 
of Israel, although Jerusalem was previously in the 
tribe of Benjamin, as all this and much more is made 
clear in the text. 

The altar should also be eleven cubits high and 
fourteen cubits wide at the top, so that when the 
priest climbs the stairs, he has to have one arm 
seven cubits long, so that he can reach into the 
middle of the altar and prepare the sacrifices. This 
would also have to be an even little priest, who would 
be fifteen or sixteen good, large cubits tall or long. 

38 Therefore this building of Ezekiel is not to be 
understood as a new physical building, but as the 
chariot in the beginning, so also the building in the 
end is nothing else, but the kingdom of Christ, the 
holy church or Christianity here on earth, until the last 
day. 

But how all the pieces are to be interpreted and 
placed, we want to save until that life, when we will 
see the whole construction ready and finished. Now, 
because it is still in progress, and many stones and 
wood belonging to it are not yet born, let alone 
carpentered, we cannot see it all. It is enough that we 
know it is God's house, and his own building, in which 
we all are. 

(40) He who is idle and merry may well see and 
search much in it, if he wants to understand and 
rhyme God's Word and the sacraments, with their 
powers and effects, as the Holy Spirit works through 
them in Christianity, and the Revelation of John can 
also help in this.

12. preface on the prophet Hosea, *) 


1532. 


Hosea lived and preached (as he_ himself 
indicates in the title) in the time of the other and last 
Jeroboam, king of Israel, at which time also Isaiah 
lived in Judah, also Amos and Micah; but Hosea was 
the oldest among them. 

(2) Jeroboam was also a fine and blessed king, 
who did much in the kingdom of Israel, as the second 
book of Kings, Cap. 14:23 ff. testifies, but still 
remained with the old idolatry of his forefathers, the 
kings of Israel, that indeed there were many excellent 
men in the people at that time, who nevertheless 
could not make the people righteous. For the devil 
had the heartache to cause in this people, that they 
always killed the prophets, and burned their children 
to idols, and thus filled the land with blood debts. As 
he is here in the first chapter, v. 5, Israel 1) therefore 
mourns. 

(3) It appears that this prophecy of Hosea was not 
written in full, but that some pieces and sayings were 
taken from his sermons and put together in a book; 
but in it one can feel and find so much about how he 
carried out the two offices abundantly and 
confidently. First, that he preached hard against 
idolatry in his time, and punished the people freshly, 
together with the kings and his princes and priests. 


1) In the Weimar: Jesreel; in the Erlanger: Jesrael. 


He has certainly eaten death (like the others) and 
died as a heretic against the priests and as a rebel 
against the king, because this is a prophetic and 
apostolic death; so Christ himself had to die. On the 
other hand, he also prophesied about Christ and his 
kingdom powerfully and almost comfortingly, as 
especially the second [v. 19] and thirteenth [v. 14] 
and fourteenth chapters [v. 7] indicate. 

4. But because he uses the word "whore" and 
"fornication" many times, and in the first chapter 
"takes a whore-wife," let no one think that he is so 
lewd, both in words and deeds; for he speaks 
spiritually, and that same whore-wife has been his 
true, honest wife, and has begotten true children with 
her; But the woman and the children had to bear such 
a shameful name, as a sign and punishment of the 
idolatrous people, who were full of spiritual 
fornication (that is, idolatry), as he himself says in the 
text: "The land runs after fornication from the LORD." 
Just as Jeremiah wore wooden chains and cups as a 
sign, and commonly all prophets did something 
strange as a sign to the people. So here his wife and 
children must also have whore names, as a sign 
against the whoreish, idolatrous people. For it is not 
to be believed that God should call a prophet a 
fornicator, as some want to interpret Hoseam here. 





13. preface from the prophets Joel.**) 


1532. 


1 Joel does not indicate at what time he lived and 
preached. But the ancients say: he was at the time 
when Hosea and Amos were; so we leave that alone 
and do not know how to improve it. 

2. but he is a kind and gentle man 


He does not scold and punish like the other prophets, 
but pleads and complains, wanting to make people 
pious with good, kind words and to protect them from 
harm and misfortune. But it will have happened to 
him like other prophets, that one

did not believe his words and took him for a fool. 
But he is highly famous in the New Testament, 
because St. Peter brings him forth, Apost. 2, 16. 17. 
2, 16. 17. And Joel must give the first sermon that 
happened in the Christian church, namely on the day 
of Pentecost in Jerusalem, when the Holy Spirit was 
given. Thus St. Paul [Rom. 10, 13.] also beautifully 
describes the saying: "Whoever calls on the name of 
the Lord shall be saved," which is also found in Joel 
Cap. 3, 5. 
4 In the first chapter he prophesies the future 
punishment of the people of Israel, that they should 
be destroyed and carried away by the Assyrians. 
And he calls the Assyrians caterpillars, locusts, 
beetles, and dung. For the Assyrians ate up the 
kingdom of Israel one by one until they destroyed it. 
But at the end of the day, King Sanherib lay low 
before Jerusalem, which Joel recalls in the second 
chapter, v. 20, when he says 


says: "And the one from midnight | will drive far away 
from you" 2c. 

5 Secondly, at the end of the second chapter and 
from then on, he prophesies about the kingdom of 
Christ and the Holy Spirit, and says about the eternal 
Jerusalem. 

6. But that he speaks of the valley of 
Jehoshaphat, how the Lord will call all the Gentiles 
there to judgment, which the old fathers understood 
by the last judgment, and | do not condemn such 
understanding, but still think that Joel's opinion is: 
Just as he calls the eternal Jerusalem the Christian 
Church, so he also calls the same the Valley of 
Jehoshaphat, because all the world is called to the 
Christian Church by the Word, and is judged in the 
same, and punished by the preaching, as they are all 
sinners before God, as Christ says: "The Spirit of 
truth will punish the world for sin." For 
Jehoshaphatthal is called the valley of judgment, just 
as Hosea in the second chapter, v. 15, calls the 
Christian church the valley of Achor. 





14, preface from the prophets Amos. *) 


1532. 


Amos shows his time, that he lived and preached 

in the time of Hosea and Isaiah, and preaches 
against the same vices and idolatry, or false saints, 
like Hosea does, and also proclaims the Assyrian 
prison. 
(2) He is also vehement, and reproaches the people 
of Israel almost through the whole book, until the end 
of the last chapter, where he prophesies of Christ 
and his kingdom, and pollutes his book with it. That 
no prophet seems to me to have so little promise and 
so much reproach and gloom, that he may well be 
called Amos (that is), a burden, or one who is heavy 
and vexatious; especially because he is a shepherd, 
and not of the order of the prophets, as he himself 
says in the seventh chapter, v. 14, in addition to 
which he goes from the tribe of Judah of Thekoa into 
the kingdom of Israel and preaches there as a 
stranger. Therefore it is also said that the priest 


Amaziah (whom he punishes in the seventh chapter, 
v. 17) had beaten him to death with a rod. 

(3) In the first chapter he is difficult and obscure to 
see, since he speaks of three and four sins, about 
which many have committed various crimes and 
have searched far and wide. But the text (I think) 
should make it clear that these three and four sins 
are no more than one sin, for he mentions and 
accuses only one sin in all cases. For example, 
against Damascum he mentions only the sin of 
driving Gilead with iron chariots. 

4 But he calls such sin three and four, because 
they neither repent nor acknowledge such sin, but 
also boast of it, and dwell on it, as if they had done 
well, as all false saints do. For sin cannot be more 
grievous, nor greater, nor more grievous.

for where it wants to be a holy, divine work, and 
makes the devil to God, and God to the devil. Just as 
three and four make seven, which is the end of the 
number in Scripture, when one turns back and 
begins to count again, both the days and the weeks. 
5 It is mentioned twice in the New Testament: first, 
Apost. 7, 42, where St. Stephen refers to it from the 
cursed chapter against the Jews, and thus proves 
that they are God's

Law never have kept from the beginning of Egypt. 

6) The other time, when St. James Apost. 15, 16. 
in the first Concilio of the Apostles leads him out of 
the last chapter to prove the Christian freedom, that 
the Gentiles in the New Testament are not obligated 
to keep Mosi's law, if the Jews themselves have 
never kept it, and also could not keep it, as St. Peter 
Apost. 15, 10. And these are the most distinguished 
two pieces in Amos, and two very good pieces. 


15. preface to the prophet ObadJa.*) 


1532. 


1 Obadiah does not indicate what time he lived, 
but his prophecy refers to the time of Babylonian 
imprisonment, for he comforts the people of Judah to 
come again to Zion. 

002 And his prophecy is especially against Edom, 
or Esau, which had a peculiar everlasting hatred and 
envy against the people of Israel and Judah; as it is 
wont to be, when friends are divided against one 
another, and especially when brethren are divided 
against one another in hatred and enmity, there is 
enmity beyond measure. 

3 Thus the Edomites were exceedingly hostile to 
the Jewish people, and had no greater joy than that 
they should see the prison of the Jews, and praised 
and mocked them in their mourning and misery. As 
almost all prophets rebuke the Edomites for such 
ugly wickedness, so also the 137th Psalm, v. 7, 
complains about them, saying: "Lord, remember the 
Edomites in the day of Jerusalem, when they said: 
Pure abe, pure abe, even to their ground. 

4) Because such things are painful to the extent 
that the miserable and afflicted (who should be 
comforted) 1) are first of all comforted to their jam. 


1) In the original: the. 


The people mock, laugh, defy and praise, so that the 
faith in God suffers a great, strong challenge, and is 
violently provoked to despair and unbelief: Here God 
sets up a prophet against such vexatious scoffers 
and tempters, and comforts the afflicted, and 
strengthens their faith with reproof and rebuke 
against such hostile Edomites, that is, scoffers of the 
wretched, and with promise and assurance of future 
help and salvation. And is indeed a necessary 
comfort and a useful Obadiah in such an accident. 

5 At the end he prophesies of Christ's kingdom, 
which shall not be at Jerusalem only, but 
everywhere. For he mixes all nations together, as 
Ephraim, Benjamin, Galaad, Philistines, Cananites, 
Zarpath, which cannot be understood of the temporal 
kingdom of Israel, since such tribes and people had 
to be distinguished in the land, according to the law 
of Moses. 

6 But that the Jews here interpret Zarpath France, 
and Sepharad Hispania, | leave aside, and hold 
nothing of it, but let Zarpath remain the city near 
Zidon, and Sepharad a city or country in Assyria, 
since they were captives at Jerusalem, as the text 
clearly says [v. 20.], "And the captives Jerusalem, 
which are at Sepharad.” But let each one think what 
he will.

16, preface to the prophet Jonah, *) 


1526. 


1) Some want to hold this prophet Jonah, as 
Jerome shows that he was the son of the widow at 
Zarpath near Zidou, who nourished the prophet 
Eliam in his time, 1 Kings 17:9 and Luc 4:26. They 
take the reason that he calls himself a son of Amithai, 
that is, a son of the truthful one, because his mother 
said to Elijah when he had raised him from death: 
"Now | know that the words of your mouth are true. 

002 Whosoever will, | will not believe it: but his 


father's name was Amithai, in Latin Verax, in 
German Wahrhaftig. And was of Gathhepher, which 
city is in the tribe of Zebulun, Jos. 19:13: for so it is 
written in the fourteenth chapter, v. 25, in the other 
book of Kings, "King Jeroboam brought again the 
border of Israel from Hemath even unto the sea in 
the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of 
Israel, which he spake by his servant Jonah the son 
of Amithai, the prophet of Gathhepher.” Also the 
widow of Zarpath was a vain Gentile, as Christ also 
reports, Luc. 4, 26. But Jonah confesses here in the 
first chapter, v. 9, that he was a Hebrew. 

3 So now we have that this Jonah has been 





In the time of King Jeroboam, whose grandfather was 
King Jehu, at which time King Uzziah reigned in 
Judah. At the same time, in the same kingdom of 
Israel, there were the prophets Hosea, Amos, Joel, in 
other places and cities. From this it can be seen that 
this Jonah was an excellent and honorable man in 
the kingdom of Israel, and that God did great things 
through him, namely, that through his preaching the 
king Jeroboam was so blessed and recovered 
everything that Hazael, the king of Syria, had taken 
away from the kingdom of Israel. 

4 But this is above all (that he did among his 
people), that he can attack such a great, mighty 
kingdom in Assyria, and preach so fruitfully among 
the Gentiles, who could not have done so much with 
many sermons among his own. As if God wanted to 
show the saying of Isaiah [Cap. 52, 15]: "He who has 
not heard, will hear", as an example that all who have 
the word abundantly despise it, and those who 
cannot have it, gladly accept it. As Christ himself 
says, Matt. 21:43, "The kingdom of God is taken from 
you, and given to the Gentiles who bring forth its 
fruits." 


Another "Preface to the Prophet Jonah" is found in this volume, in the supplement to the sixth volume, 
before the "Interpretations on the Prophet Jonah." 


17, preface from the prophets Micah. *) 


1532. 


1 The prophet Micah was at the time of Isaiah. He 
also quotes the words of the same prophet, which 
are written in the second chapter, so that one can 
well feel how the prophets, who lived in one time, 
preached almost one and the same word of Christ.

a room, and well cleared. Wittenberg, thou shalt 
become a wide mountain 2c. The grammarians will 
notice this and feel our diligence. 


18, preface to the prophet Nahum.*) 


1532. 


1 The prophet Nahum prophesied of the 
destruction that the Assyrians would do against the 
people of Israel and Judah. As was done by 
Salmanasser and Sanherib because of their great 
sin. But so far that the rest of the pious should be 
preserved; as happened to Ezechia and his like. 
Therefore it seems that he was before Isaiah, or 
about the same time as Isaiah. 

2 Then he proclaims the destruction of the kingdom 
of Assyria, especially of the city of Nineveh, which 
was very righteous in the days of Jonah, but 
afterward became again full of wickedness, and 
greatly afflicted the captives of Israel; that Tobias 
also. proclaims a final destruction to their 
wickedness, saying [Cap. 14:13], "Their wickedness 
shall bring them to an end." So he consoles after his 


name (for Nahum is called con 





solator, in German a comforter) the people of God, 
like their enemies, the Assyrians, shall again be 
disturbed. 

3) At the end of the first chapter 1) it also reads, 
like Isaiah Cap. 52, 7, of the good preachers who 
proclaim peace and salvation on the mountains, and 
is called Judah rejoicing. Although this may be 
understood from the time of Ezekiel after Sanherib, 
when Judah was saved and remained before King 
Sanherib, it is a common prophecy, also concerning 
Christ, that the good news and the joyful service of 
God, taught and confirmed by God's word, should 
remain in Judah, which is why he is called and is a 
true Nahum.

comfort" 2c. But here: "This Habakkuk is a prophet of comfort" 2c. Therefore we leave out the preface here.

20, preface from the prophets Zephaniah, *) 


1 Zephaniah was in the time of Jeremiah the prophet, 
for he prophesied under King Josiah, as Jeremiah's title 
indicates. Therefore he prophesied the same thing that 
Jeremiah prophesied, that Jerusalem and Judah should 
be destroyed and the people led away because of their 
impenitent evil life. 


(2) He does not name the king of Babylon, who would 
cause them such distress and imprisonment as 
Jeremiah does, but he speaks plainly that God would 
bring such calamity and plague upon them, that he might 
move them to repentance. For all the prophets have 
never been able to persuade this people that God was 
angry with them. They have always relied on the glory 
that they are and were called God's people. And 
whoever preached that God was angry with them had to 
be a false prophet and die, for they would not believe 
that God would leave His people like this, just as all the 
heretics are now scolded. 


and kill those who teach that the church is wrong and 
sinning, and that God will punish them. 

(3) He prophesied not only against Judah, but also 
against all the surrounding countries and neighbors, 
such as the Philistines, Moab, even the Moors and 
Assyria; for the king of Babylon was to be a rod of God 
over all the countries. 


In the third chapter, he prophesies gloriously and 
clearly about the joyful and blessed kingdom of Christ, 
which is to be spread throughout the world. And even 
though he is a minor prophet, he speaks more about 
Christ than many other great prophets, even about 
Jeremiah. So that he might again comfort the people 
abundantly, so that they would not despair of God in the 
Babylonian prison and misfortune, as if he had rejected 
them eternally, but would be sure that after such 
punishment they would again come to grace, and 
receive the promised Savior Christ with his glorious 
kingdom. 


21. preface to the prophet Haggai? *) 


1 Haggai is the first prophet given to the people after 
the prison of Babylon, through whose prophecy the 
temple and the service of God were restored, and 
Zechariah was given to him as a companion for two 
months, so that God's word might be believed all the 
more surely through the mouth of two witnesses. The 
people were almost in doubt as to whether the temple 
would be rebuilt. 

002 And we observe that it is said of this prophet 
Daniel in the ninth, v. 25, saying, From the time that the 
commandment shall go forth, that Jerusalem shall be 
built again until Christ the Prince, there shall be no more 
buildings. 


seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks" 2c. For even though 
a command had gone out before through Cyrus the king 
to build the temple in Jerusalem at his (the king's) 
expense, it was prevented until the time of Haggai and 
Zechariah, when God's command went out through their 
prophecy; then it took place. 

(3) And he reproved the people, because they had 
not cared to prepare the temple and the service of God, 
but had been diligent only for their goods and houses. 
Therefore they were also afflicted with precious time and 
damage to crops, wine, grain and all kinds of cereals, as 
an example to all the wicked, who have not kept God's 
word and service.

and are always stingy in their sackcloth. To such 
alone this text applies, since it says: "Their sack shall 
be empty. 

4 In all histories, where God's servants do not want 
to be fed, nor do they want to receive his word, he 
confidently lets them be stingy for themselves and 
always gather. But in the end he makes the sack full 
of holes and blows into it so that it soutters and melts 
away, so that no one knows where it remains. He 
also wants 





with eat, or they shall also not find to eat. 

(5) He also prophesies of Christ in the second 
chapter, v. 8, that he should soon come, a comfort to 
all the Gentiles. So that he secretly indicates that the 
kingdom and law of the Jews will come to an end, and 
all the kingdoms of the world will be destroyed, and 
Christ will become their subject, which has happened 
until now, and will continue to happen until the last 
day, when it will all be fulfilled. 


22, preface to the prophet Zechariah.*) 


1532. 


11. This prophet was in Babylonian prison, and 
together with his companion Haggai, he helped to 
rebuild Jerusalem and the temple, and to bring the 
scattered people together again, so that regiment 
and order could be established in the land. He is truly 
one of the most consoling prophets, for he presents 
many sweet and comforting visions and gives many 
sweet and kind words to comfort and strengthen the 
afflicted and scattered people to begin the building 
and the regiment, which until then had suffered great 
and various opposition; this he does until the fifth 
chapter. 

2. in the fifth he prophesies, under a vision of the 
letter and the shekel, of the false teachers that should 
come afterward among the Jewish people, who 
would deny Christ; which vision still concerns the 
Jews today. 

In the sixth he prophesies of the gospel of Christ 
and the spiritual temple to be built in all the world, 
because the Jews denied him and would not have 
him. 

In the seventh and eighth, a question arises, to 
which the prophet answers, comforting and exhorting 
them once again to build and govern, and thus 
evoking such a prophecy of his time about rebuilding. 





In the ninth he goes into the future time, and 
prophesies first in the tenth chapter, v. 4, how the 
great Alexander should win Tyrum, Zidon and the 
Philistines, so that the whole world would be opened 
to the future gospel of Christ, and introduces the King 
Christ in Jerusalem on a donkey. 

6th But in the eleventh he prophesied that Christ 
should be sold of the Jews for thirty pieces of silver, 
wherefore he would also forsake them, that 
Jerusalem should be finally destroyed, and the Jews 
should be hardened and scattered in error, and so 
the gospel and the kingdom of Christ should come 
among the Gentiles after the passion of Christ, that 
he before, as the shepherd, should be slain, and the 
apostles, as the sheep, should be scattered; for he 
had to suffer before, and so come into his glory. 

7 In the last chapter, when he _ disturbed 
Jerusalem, he also refers to the Levitical priesthood 
with its nature and utensils and feasts, and says: "All 
spiritual offices will be common to serve God with it, 
and no longer only of the tribe of Levi, that is, other 
priests, other feasts, other sacrifices, other worship 
should come, which could also be practiced by other 
tribes, even Egypt and all Gentiles. That is, the Old 
Testament was purely taken away.

23, preface to the prophet Malachi. *') 


1532. 


|. This Malachi the Hebrews hold to have been 
Ezra; this we leave so well, for we can have nothing 
certain of him, without which, to take so much from 
his prophecy, he was not long before Christ's birth, 
and certainly the last prophet; for he speaks in the 
third chapter that Christ the Lord should soon come. 

2. and is a fine prophet, who has beautiful sayings 
about Christ and the gospel, which he calls a pure 
sacrifice in all the world. For through the gospel God's 
grace is praised, which is the true, pure sacrifice of 
thanksgiving. Item, he prophesies of the future of 
John the Baptist, as Christ Himself interprets it Matth. 
11, 14. and calls John His angel and Eliam, of which 
Malachi writes. 

(3) He also scolded his people severely for not 
giving their tithes and other duties to the priests. And 
if they did give, they gave it with all unfaithfulness, as 
unhealthy, unfit sheep, and what they themselves did 
not like, that had to be good for the poor priests and 
preachers. As it happens, where there is the right 
word of God and faithful preachers, they must suffer 
hunger and need; false teachers must always have 
plenty. Although the priests with 


1) In the original: second. 


The people of the world will also be scolded for 
accepting and sacrificing such sacrifices. That is 
what the dear miser did. 

4 But God indicates here that he is very 
displeased with them, and calls such unfaithfulness 
and wickedness a disgrace to himself. That is why he 
forbids them and accepts the Gentiles as his people. 

(5) After this he reproached the priests especially, 
because they counterfeited the word of God, and 
taught unfaithfully, and so deceived many, and 
abused their priestly office, that they did not punish 
those who offered things unfitly, or were otherwise 
not pious, but praised them, and spoke piously, that 
they might receive only sacrifices and enjoyment 
from them. Thus avarice and belly care have always 
done harm to the word and service of God, and 
always make hypocrites of [the] preachers. 

(6) He also rebuked them for afflicting their wives 
and despising them, so that their sacrifices and 
worship were also defiled. For in the Law of Moses it 
was forbidden to offer to God afflicted sacrifices, and 
those who were afflicted were not allowed to offer 
sacrifices or eat of sacrifices. Those who made their 
wives grieved and weeping were the cause of this. 
They wanted to follow Abraham's example, who had 
to drive out and afflict his Hagar. But he did not do it 
out of courage, just as he had not taken her in 
marriage out of malice. 


24, preface to the hook of Judith.**) 


1530. 


1) If one could prove the story of Judith from proven, 
certain histories, then it would be a noble, fine book, 
which should also be in the Bible, but it hardly 
rhymes with the histories of the Holy Scriptures, 
especially with Jeremiah and Ezra, which are 
connected to 


show how Jerusalem and the whole land were 
destroyed and then poorly rebuilt in the time of the 
Persian monarchy, which held all the land around. 

2 Against this this book writes in the first chapter 


that the king Nebuchadnezzar at Babylon

W. XIV, 82-84. 71 





The story is said to have taken place before the 
Jades Prison and before the Persian monarchy. 
Again, Philo says that it happened after the return 
and return of the Jews from Babylon under King 
Ahasuerus, at which time the Jews had neither built 
a temple nor Jerusalem, nor had they a regiment. 
Remains therefore the error and doubt, both of the 
tides and names, that | can't rhyme it together 
anywhere. 

Some want it to be not a story, 1) but a spiritually 
beautiful poem of a holy, spiritual man, who wanted 
to paint and model the whole Jewish people's 
happiness and victory against all their enemies, 
miraculously bestowed by God at all times, just as 
Solomon also poems and sings about a bride in his 
Song of Songs, and yet does not mean a person or 
story, but the whole people of Israel, and as St. John 
in Apocalypsis and Daniel paint many pictures and 
animals, so that they do not mean such persons, but 
the whole Christian churches and kingdoms. John in 
Apocalypsi, and Daniel paint many pictures and 
animals, yet they do not mean such persons, but the 
whole Christian churches and kingdoms. And Christ, 
our Lord, Himself likes to use parables and such 
poems in the Gospel, and compares the Kingdom of 
Heaven to ten virgins; item, a merchant and pearls, 
a becker, a mustard seed; item, fishermen and nets; 
item, shepherds and sheep, and so on. 

4 Such opinion pleases me almost well, and | think 
that the poet has knowingly and with diligence put the 
error of the tide and names in it, to admonish the 
reader that he should consider and understand it for 
such a spiritual, holy poem. 


1) History - fact that has happened. 





(5) And the names rhyme finely with this. For 
Judith is called Judea (that is), the Jewish people, so 
a chaste, holy widow, that is, God's people are 
always a forsaken widow, yet chaste and holy, and 
remain pure and holy in the word of God and right 
faith, chastening themselves and praying. Holofernes 


is called profanus dux, vel gubernator, pagan, 
godless or unchristian lord or prince; these are all 
enemies of the Jewish people. Bethulia (which city is 
also not known anywhere) is called a_ virgin, 
indicating that at that time the believing pious Jews 
were the pure virgin, without all idolatry and unbelief, 
as they are called in Isaiah and Jeremiah; thereby 
they also remained invincible, even though they were 
in trouble. 

6) And it may be that they played such poems, as 
one plays the Passion with us, and other holy stories, 
2) so that they taught their people and the youth, as 
in acommon picture or play, to trust God, to be pious, 
and to hope for all help and comfort from God in all 
hardships, against all enemies 2c. 

(7) Therefore it is a fine, good, holy, and useful 
book for us Christians to read. For the words spoken 
by the persons here are to be understood as if they 
were spoken by a spiritual, holy poet or prophet from 
the Holy Spirit, who presents such persons in his play 
and preaches to us through them. And so the wisdom 
of Philoui, which chides the tyrants and praises God's 
help, which he shows to his people 2c., belongs to 
this book as a song to such a play; which may well 
be called a common example of the same book.

25 Preface to the Wisdom of Solomon, *) 
1529, 


1. 1) Because the present Diet at Speier has 
divided us, that we, who have taken the prophets 
before us to be fully translated, may not all be with 
each other, and | have been prevented by accidental 
weakness, that | have been unskilled in such and 
other business, and yet have not wanted to sit idle at 
all; In the meantime, | have taken this piece of wood 
and carved on it, namely, the Book of Wisdom, 
translated with the help of my good friends and, as 
much as God has given us, brought it from the dark 
Latin and Greek into the German light. And even if it 
has been Germanized by others before, | still think 
that this German should suffer next to our German, 
or even be in dire need of it. 

2 This book has long been in dispute as to 
whether it should be counted among the books of the 
holy Scriptures of the Old Testament or not, 
especially because the poet lets himself be heard in 
the ninth chapter, v. 7, as if King Solomon were 
speaking in this entire book, who is also highly 
praised by Wisdom in the Book of Kings. 

(3) But the ancient fathers have straightway 
separated it out of the holy scriptures, and held that 
it was made under the person of King Solomon, that 
for the sake of this highly famous king's name and 
person it might be the more esteemed, and have 
greater renown among the mighty men of the earth, 
to whom it is chiefly written, and might long since 
have perished, where the master, if he had been of 
little renown, would have let it go forth under his 
name. 

4. but they consider Philo to be the master of this 
book, who was undoubtedly one of the most learned 
and wise of the Jews, according to the prophets. 


1) The first paragraph is found in the first single print: "Die Weisheit 
Salomonis, An die Tyrannen, Verdeudscht durch M. Luth. Wittemberg. 
15.2.9." At the end: "Gedriickt zu Wittemberg, durch Hans Lufft. 1.5.2.9." 
In later Bible editions, the same is omitted. 





He has had a lot of experience, as he has proven with 
other books and deeds. 

For in the time of the emperor Caligula, when the 
Jews were most shamefully defiled by some Greeks, 
as Appion of Alexandria and others, with 
blasphemous writings and disgraceful speeches, and 
thereafter were most venomously denounced and 
accused before the emperor, the said Philo was sent 
by the Jewish people to the emperor to answer for 
the Jews and to excuse them. But when the emperor 
was so bitter with the Jews that he rebuked them and 
would not listen, Philo, as a man full of courage and 
comfort, let himself be heard and said to his Jews: 
"Well, dear brethren, do not be afraid of this, and be 
of good cheer; because the help of man is denied us, 
the help of God will certainly be with us. 

(6) For such a reason and cause, methinks, this 
book has flowed, that Philo, because his and the 
Jews' cause and right may not take place before the 
emperor, turns to God, and rebukes the violent and 
evil mouths with God's judgment. That is why he 
speaks so vehemently and sharply in the first and 
second chapters against the poisonous, evil tongues 
that persecute and kill the righteous and innocent for 
the sake of truth, and introduces the great examples 
of divine judgment that God exercised against King 
Pharaoh and the Egyptians, for the sake of the 
children of Israel, and does it with such excellent, 
fierce words, as if he would gladly strike both the 
emperor, the Romans, and the poisonous tongues of 
the Greeks, who praised against the Jews, with every 
word, and by such mighty examples deter and 
comfort the Jews. 

7. 2) Finally, if you look at the time, history and 
writing of Philonis, and hold this book against it, it 
rhymes and rhymes so strongly. 


2) This paragraph, which is in the first edition, is omitted in later Bible 
editions.

so evenly together that the holy fathers do not without} who did it, both to the enemies and to his saints. 


great cause consider Philo [to be] the master of this 
book. 

8. But afterwards this book is considered by many 
to be a true copy of the holy scriptures, but especially 
in the Roman church it is held so high and beautiful 
that hardly any book in the scriptures is made into so 
much song as this one; Perhaps for the reason that in 
this book the tyrants are so severely punished and 
attacked with words, and the saints and martyrs are 
so highly comforted, and in Rome the Christians were 
persecuted and martyred more than anywhere else in 
the world, they have driven this book the most, as it 
rhymes with the matter, with condemnation against 
the tyrants and with consolation for the saints, even 
though they did not understand many parts of it and 
often pulled it by the hair; As has often happened in 
all the Scriptures, and continues to happen daily. 

(9) As for all this, there is much good in it, and well 
worth reading. But especially should the great men 
read it, who rage against their subjects, and rage 
against the innocent for the sake of God's word. For 
he addresses them in the sixth chapter, v. 10, and 
confesses that this book is written to them, saying: 
"My words are for you tyrants" 2c. And he very finely 
testifies that the worldly overlords have their authority 
from God, and are God's officials, but forbid them that 
they tyrannically use such divine, commanded office. 

(10) Therefore this book comes to light not 

unevenly in our time, because now even the tyrants 
confidently abuse their authority against the one from 
whom they have such authority. And yet they live so 
shamefully in their idolatry and unchristian holiness, 
as Philo describes the Romans and pagans in their 
idolatry, that it rhymes everywhere with our present 
time. 
(11) It is called the Wisdom of Solomon because it is 
written under Solomon's name and person, and it 
glorifies wisdom, namely, what it is, what it can do, 
where it comes from. And it pleases me greatly that 
he praises the word of God so highly, and ascribes 
everything to the word that God has ever willed. 


(12) From this it can be clearly seen that he 
means "wisdom" here, not the clever, high thoughts 
of the pagan teachers and human reason, but the 
holy, divine word. And what praise and praise you 
hear of wisdom in this, know that it is not said 
otherwise than by the word of God. For in the 
sixteenth chapter, v. 7, he himself says that the 
children of Israel were not nourished by the bread of 
heaven, nor were they healed by the serpent of 
brass, but by the word of God, as Christ also says in 
Matt. 4:4: "Man does not live by bread alone. 
Therefore, he teaches that wisdom comes from 
nowhere but from God, and thus gives many 
examples from Scripture, and gives to wisdom that 
which Scripture gives to the word of God. 

(13) | have spoken this all the more gladly, 
because the word "wisdom" is commonly heard in a 
different way than the Scriptures require, namely, 
when one hears it, one goes away with flying 
thoughts, and thinks that it is nothing but thoughts 
that lie hidden in the hearts of wise men, and 
therefore does not consider the outward word or 
Scripture to be wisdom, since all men's thoughts 
without God's word are vain lies and false dreams. 
Therefore, because this book is called "the Wisdom 
of Solomon", it is said as much as if | said: A vision of 
Solomon from the Word of God, and "the Spirit of 
Wisdom" nothing else but the faith or understanding 
of the same Word, which the Holy Spirit gives. Such 
faith or spirit is able to do everything and does, as this 
book praises in the seventh chapter, v. 27. 

(14) Finally, this book is a proper interpretation 
and example of the first commandment. For here you 
see that it thoroughly teaches to fear and trust God; 
scares those with examples of divine wrath who do 
not fear and despise God, again comforts those with 
examples of divine grace who believe and trust him, 
which is nothing other than the right understanding of 
the first commandment. 

(15) From this it can be seen that from the first 
commandment, as from the primary commandment, 
all wisdom springs and flows, and of course that the 
first commandment is the only one.

This commandment is the right sun, since all wise 
men see what they see. For he who fears God and 
believes is full of wisdom, master of all the world, 
mighty of all words and works, judge of all doctrine 
and life, valid and helpful before God. Again, he who 
believes the 


If a man does not have the first commandment, and 
neither fears nor trusts God, he is full of foolishness, 
can do nothing and is nothing. And this is the 
foremost reason why this book is to be read, that one 
may learn to fear and trust God, since he helps us 
with grace, amen! 


26, preface from the book Tobia, *) 


1530. 


What is said of the book of Judith may also be said 
of this book of Tobiah. If it is a story, then it is a fine, 
holy story. But if it is a poem, then it is truly a quite 
beautiful, wholesome, useful poem and play by a 
witty poet. And it is to be assumed that there were 
many such beautiful poems and games among the 
Jews, in which they practiced on their feasts and 
Sabbaths, and thus presented God's word and work 
to the youth with pleasure, especially since they sat 
in good peace and government. For they have had 
excellent people, as prophets, singers, poets and the 
like, who have practiced God's word diligently and in 
all kinds of ways. 

2. and God grant that the Greeks have taken their 
way of playing "comedy" and tragedy from the Jews, 
as well as much other wisdom and worship 2c. For 
Judith gives a good, serious, brave tragedy; so 
Tobias gives a fine, lovely, godly comedy. For just as 
the book of Judith shows how the land and the 
people are often miserable, and how the tyrants first 
rage with hope and finally fall to the ground in 
disgrace, so the book of Tobias shows how a pious 
farmer or citizen also suffers, and there is much 
suffering in the state of marriage, but God always 
graciously helps, and finally ends the end with joy, so 
that the spouses should learn to have patience, and 
gladly bear all kinds of suffering in the hope of the 
future, in the right fear of God and firm faith. 

(3) And the Greek copy almost appears to have been 
a game, for it says 


all in Toby's person, as the persons in the play are 
wont to do. After that, a master came and put such a 
game into a proper speech. The names are also well 
suited to this. For Tobias is called a pious man; he 
also begets a Tobias again, and must live in driving 
and care, both for the sake of the tyrants and his 
neighbors. In addition (so that no misfortune is alone) 
he also becomes bliud, and finally also at odds with 
his dear Hannah, and sends her son away, and is 
indeed a miserable, miserable life. But he remains 
firm in faith, patience and good works. Hanna is called 
a lovely housewife, who lives with her husband in love 
and friendship. The devil Asmodes is called a 
destroyer or corrupter; this is the household devil, who 
hinders and corrupts everything, so that one cannot 
leave with child or servant. Sara is called a fighter or 
victor, who at last prevails, conquers and wins. Thus 
the angel Raphael (that is), physician or healer, is also 
there, and calls himself Azariah, that is, helper or 
succorer, the son of the great Azariah, that is, God the 
Most High's succorer, messenger or messenger. For 
GOD helps households, and stands by the spouses, 
otherwise they could not stay anywhere before the 
Asmod. 

Therefore the book is useful and good for us 
Christians to read, as a fine Hebrew poet, who does 
not act frivolously, but the right things, and who writes 
and describes Christian things out of measure. And to 
such a book belongs Jesus Sirach, who is a right 
teacher and comforter of the common man and 
householder in all things, and Tobias is an example of 
just such a book.

27 Preface to the Book of Jesus Sirach. *) 


1530. 


1 This book has been called in Latin 


Ecclesiasticus, which they have translated: the 
spiritual discipline. And is almost well practiced and 
used in the church, with reading, singing and 
preaching, but with little understanding and use, 
without having to boast of the clerical status and 
church pomp. 

2 Otherwise his right name is called "Jesus 
Sirach", after his master, as his own preface and the 
Greek gives. As also Moses, Joshua, Isaiah, and all 
the prophets’ books, are called after their masters, 
and is held by the ancient fathers not in the number 
of the holy scriptures, but as otherwise a good, fine 
book of a wise man, so we leave it. 

But it seems to us, because he himself confesses 
in the preface, that he came to Egypt in the time of 
King Energeti, and there he finished this book (which 
his grandfather had started before), that he has 
gathered the best he found from many books. 
Especially because in Egypt there was a delicious 
Liberei, prepared by Euergeti's father, King 
Philadelphnm, that at that time both, books and 
learned people, were in great honor, and struck from 
all countries, as a great high school, especially to 
Greece; in addition, the Jews built a temple there, 
and erected worship. 

4 This also shows that in this book one piece is 
not neatly put on top of the other, as the work of one 
master, but is drawn from various masters and 
books, and mixed with one another, as a bee puts its 
seed on various flowers and mixes them together. 
And it seems that this Jesus Sirach was from the 
royal tribe of David, and a nephew or grandson of 
Amos Sirach, who was the highest prince in the 
house of Judah, as one may take from Philone, about 
two hundred years before the birth of Christ, about 
the time of the Maccabees. 

5. it is a useful book for the common man; for also all 
his diligence is that he may 





to make a citizen or householder God-fearing, pious 
and wise, how he should behave towards God, God's 
word, priests, parents, wife, children, his own body, 
servants, goods, neighbors, friends, enemies, 
authorities and everyone; so that it might well be 
called a book of domestic discipline, or of the virtues 
of a pious householder, which is also and should be 
called right spiritual discipline. 

But what work it took us to translate this book, 
whoever desires to know, may hold our German 
against all other copies, both Greek, Latin and 
German languages, they are old or new, so the work 
shall give the master 1) well testimony. So many 
clever ones in all languages have come over this 
book that it would not be a miracle, because without 
it all things in it have not been in order from its 
beginning, that it would have become completely 
unrecognizable, incomprehensible, and incapable of 
all things. But we have read it together again like a 
torn, trampled and scattered letter, and wiped off the 
dung, and brought it as far as anyone can see, praise 
be to God and thanks be to God, amen. Christians 
will not reproach us in this; but the world, as it has 
done until now, according to its virtue, will know how 
to thank us for it. 


Preface of Jesus Sirach to his book. 2) 


Many great men have given us wisdom from the 
law, the prophets, and others who have followed it; 
therefore Israel is to be praised for her wisdom and 
teaching. Therefore not only let those who have it 
and read it become wise from it, but also let them 
serve others with teaching and writing. 

My grandfather Jesus, after making a special 
effort to read the Law, the Pro-.

He had practiced well in them, and he intended to 
write something about wisdom and good manners, 
so that those who would like to learn and become 
wise would become the more understanding and 
skilled in leading a good life. Therefore | ask you to 
accept it kindly and to read it with diligence, and to 
consider us worthy, if we cannot speak as well as the 
famous orators. For what is written in the Hebrew 
language does not read as well when it is translated 
into another language; not only this book of mine, but 
also of the law, the prophets, and the prophets. 





and other books are much different when they are 
spoken under their language. 

When | arrived in Egypt in the thirty-eighth year, in 
the time of King Ptolemaei Euergetis, and remained 
there all my life, | gained space to read and write 
many good things. Therefore | saw it good and 
necessary that | put the diligence and effort on it, and 
interpreted this book. And while | had time, | worked 
and worked diligently to finish this book and bring it 
to day, so that even the strangers who want to learn 
may become accustomed to "good" customs, so that 
they may live according to the law of the Lord. 





28, preface to the book of Baruch. *) 


1530. 


Very low is this book, who also is the good Baruch. 
For it is not credible that St. Jeremiah's servant, who 
is also called Baruch (to whom this epistle is also 
dedicated), should not be higher and richer in spirit, 
neither is this Baruch. [The number of years with the 
Histories does not coincide with this, that | would 
have let him be so close to the third and fourth book 
of Ezra. For the same two books of Ezra we have 
badly not wanted to translate, because so nothing is 
in it, that 





One cannot find much better in Aesopo or still lesser 
books, without that in the fourth book to it are vain 
dreams, as Jerome himself says, and Lyra did not 
want to interpret; to it in the Greek are not found. 
Otherwise, they may be interpreted by whoever 
wants to, but not in this number of books. Baruch we 
let baptize among this bunch, because he writes so 
hard against idolatry and reproaches Mosi's law. 





29, preface from the first book of the Maccabees? *) 


1530. 


1 This book is also one of those that are not counted 
in the Hebrew Bibles. Although it keeps almost the 
same way with speeches and words, as other books 
of the holy scripture, and would not be unworthy to 
be included, because it is a very necessary and 
useful book to understand the prophet Daniel in the 
eleventh chapter. For that which Daniel prophesies 
in the said chapter, of the abomination and calamity 
of the people of Israel, which shall be in the future. 





This book describes the fulfillment of this, namely 
Antiochum the Noble, and as Daniel speaks, the 
small help and great persecution of the Gentiles and 
false Jews, which happened in the time of the 
Maccabees. Therefore it is also useful for us 
Christians to read and know. 

2. firstly, because the same Antiochus is 
considered to be a figure or image of the end Christ, 
who committed such abominations and destruction 
of God.

W.xiv, 94-97. 83 





If we learn from this that the end of the Christian 
service in Jerusalem and in the Jewish land, not far 
before the birth of Christ and the first future, was the 
real end of Christ, who before the other and last 
future of Christ should also destroy Christianity and 
destroy the service of God; So that we should not be 
frightened when we experience this and see it before 
our eyes, but receive the consolation and hold fast 
that we, together with Christianity, must nevertheless 
be preserved and finally saved, no matter how great 
the rage, and the devil as angry as he ever can. 

For we also see the same help, however small 
and insignificant, that God Almighty has begun to 
show us. And the dear holy gospel is the sword, so 
that His own may nevertheless attack the present 
end-Christ in all honesty, and accomplish something, 
even though it costs much bloodshed and suffering, 
just as He also helped His people at that time by the 
sword of the Maccabees. Even though it was not 
without persecution and great heartache, they 
nevertheless cleansed the temple and restored 
worship, and brought the people back to the former 
regime, just as the gospel is now sweeping away 
idolatry, and as Christ says that his angels will clear 
away all evil from his kingdom, and gather the true 
Christians together again into the old, true Christian 
faith, and into righteous good works and worship. 

004 Secondly, that we may also be comforted in 
that he helpeth them, not only against Antiochum and 
the Gentiles, but also against the traitors and 
apostate Jews, which have 





The heathen have slain and persecuted their own 
people, their brethren, and have put on all their 
heartaches, that we may be sure, and remain 
undaunted, whether the false Christs and the spirits 
of the heathen, who have now also become our 
persecutors, shall rise up against us, and afflict us 
and do us harm as much, if not more, than our 
Antiochus or the end-Christ. For Daniel said this, and 
told us for our consolation, that it should be so, and 
that it should come to pass, that the children of our 
people should deal treacherously with us, and help to 
persecute us confidently. Therefore we will not have 
it much better than those pious children of Israel had 
it under their Antioch or end-Christ with their false 
brothers. 

5. In the end, however, these same enemies and 
traitors will be punished by God, and their tyranny and 
treachery will not remain unscented, so that we may 
look upon our end-Christians, tyrants, and red spirits 
with joyful thoughts and good courage, and endure 
their defiance, We are sure that they will not last long, 
much less get to where they think they are going, but 
(like Antiochus and those traitors) will soon receive 
their deserved reward, as a good portion of such 
punishment is already in the offing and increases 
daily. Although they are obdurate and blinded, they 
do not turn away from it, we have no power over them; 
they want to know what they have done. May God 
Almighty grant that, since they do not want anything 
else, it may be done quickly and soon to sanctify His 
rains and promote His kingdom, and to comfort all 
sorrowful and captive hearts in the devil's and the end 
Christ's kingdom, amen. 





39, preface from the second brook of the Maccabees. *)

This is called and shall be the other book 
Maccabaeorum, as the title indicates. But this cannot 
be right, because it reports some history that 
happened before the first book, and comes no further 
than the Judam Maccabaeun, that is, until the 


seventh chapter of the first book, that it should be 
called cheaper the first than the other, one wanted to 
call it then: "another book", and not the other book 
Maccabaorum, alium vel alienum scilicet, non 
secundum. But we let it go along like this, for the

The story of the seven martyrs of Maccabeorum and 
their mother, and other pieces. 

But it looks as if it was not one master, but patched 
together from many books. It also has a hard knot in 
the fourteenth chapter of Rasias, who strangled 
himself, which also challenges St. Augustine and the 
ancient fathers. For such an example is no good, and 
is not to be praised, even if it is patient. 


and may well be interpreted. Thus, the first chapter 
describes the death of Antioch in a different way than 
the first book does. 

3) Summa: As cheaply as the first book should be 
included in the number of the holy scriptures, so 
cheaply is this other book thrown out, even though 
there is something good in it. But all this is for the 
pious reader to judge and recognize.

(1) Here follow some pieces which we do not want 
to translate in the prophet Daniel and in the book of 
Esther. For we have plucked up such cornflowers 
(because they are not in the Hebrew Daniel and 
Esther); and yet, so that they do not spoil, we have 
placed them here in special spice gardens or beds, 
because nevertheless much good is found in them, 
and especially the hymn Benedicite. 

2. but the text of Susanna, Bel, Habakkuk, and 
Dragon, also sees beautiful spiritual 





Poems like Judith and Tobias, because the names 
are also in addition. As, Susanna is called a rose, that 
is, a beautiful, pious country and people, or poor 
hemp among the thorns. Daniel is called a judge, and 
so on; everything is easily interpreted to a Policei, 1) 
Oeconomei, or pious bunch of believers, be it about 
the story as it may. 


1) “Policey", that is politia, secular regiment; "Oeconomei", 
oeconomia, household. 





32, preface from the New Testament, 


according to the edition of Anno 1522 and 1527.**) 


It would be right and proper that this book should 
go out without all preface and foreign names, and 
only bear its own new name and speech. But since 
by some wild interpretations and prefaces the 
Christian's mind has been driven away to the point 
that one almost no longer knows what is called 
Gospel or Law, New Testament or Old Testament, 
the necessity demands that an announcement and 
preface be made, so that the simple man may be led 
out of his old delusion onto the right path and 
instructed as to what he should expect in this book, 
lest he seek commandments and laws when he 
should seek the Gospel and promise of God. 





2) Therefore, it should be known first of all that the 
delusion that there are four Gospels and only four 
evangelists must be rejected, and that some divide 


the New Testament books into legal, historical, 


prophetic, and sapiential, and think (I do not know 
how) to compare the New Testament with the Old 
Testament; but to hold firmly that, 2) just as the Old 
Testament is a book in which God's law and 
commandment are found, so also the history of both 
of them, who kept the same and did not keep the

W. XIV, 99-101. 87 





The New Testament is a book in which the Gospel 
and God's promise are written. New Testament is 
one book, in which the Gospel and God's promise are 
written, along with the history of those who believe 
and do not believe. So that one may be sure that 
there is only One Gospel; just as there is only One 
Book of the New Testament, and only One Glory, and 
only One God who promises. 1) For gospel is a Greek 
word, and means in German: gute Botschaft, gute 
Mare, gute neue Zeitung, gut Geschrei, davon man 
sing, sagen und frohlich ist. When 2) David overcame 
the great Goliath, good tidings and comforting new 
tidings came to the Jewish people, that their terrible 
enemy had been slain, and that they had been 
delivered to joy and peace; whereof they sang, and 
leaped, and were glad. 

3) The Gospel of God and the New Testament are 
good tales and cries that have been spread 
throughout the world by the apostles, about a true 
David, who contended with sin, death and the devil, 
and overcame them, and thus redeemed, justified, 4) 
made alive and saved all those who had been caught 
in sins, tormented with death, and overcome by the 
devil, without any merit on their part, and thus 
satisfied them and brought God back to heaven. 
Therefore they sing, give thanks, praise God and 
rejoice forever, if they firmly believe otherwise and 
remain steadfast in the faith. 

4. Such a cry and comforting tale, or evangelical 
and divine new newspaper, is called a New 
Testament because, just as a will is when a dying 
man decides his property to be distributed to the 
designated heirs after his death: So also Christ, 
before he died, commanded and appointed to 
proclaim this gospel after his death to all the world, 
and thereby to all who believe he gave for their own 
all his goods, that is, his life, that he might swallow up 
death; his righteousness, that he might destroy sin; 
and his blessedness, that he might overcome eternal 
damnation. Now the poor man, dead in sins and 
bound for hell 


1) The preceding sentence is not in the 1527 edition. 
2) 1522: same as. 

3) 1522: this. 

4) 1522: justified. 





The man who is entangled in the world hears nothing 
more comforting than such a dear, sweet message 
from Christ, and his heart must laugh at the bottom of 
it and rejoice when he believes it to be true. 

Now God, in order to strengthen such faith, has 
promised this gospel and testament of His many 
times in the Old Testament through the prophets, 5) 
as St. Paul Rom. 1, 1. 2. says: "| am set apart to 
preach the gospel of God, which He promised 
beforehand through His prophets, in the holy 
Scriptures, of His Son, who was born to Him of the 
seed of David" 2c. 

6) And that we should show them some, he 
promised at the first, saying to the serpent, Genesis 
3:15, "I will put enmity 6) between thee and the 
woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall 
bruise thy head 7) and thou shalt bruise his heel." 8) 
Christ is the seed of this woman who crushed the 
devil's head, 9) that is, sin, death, hell, and all his 
power. For without this seed, no man can escape sin, 
death, nor hell. 

7. item, Gen. 22, 18. He promised 10) Abraham: 
"Through your seed all nations 11) on earth shall be 
blessed. Christ is the seed of Abraham, says St. Paul 
Gal. 3, 16, who has blessed all the world through the 
gospel. For where Christ is not, there is still the curse 
that fell on Adam and his children when he sinned, so 
that they must all be guilty of sin, death and hell. 
Against the curse the gospel now blesses all the 
world, so that it publicly proclaims: "Whoever 
believes in this seed of Abraha shall be blessed, that 
is, freed from sin, death and hell, and shall remain 
righteous, 12) alive and blessed forever. As Christ 
Himself says, John 11:26, "He that believeth on Me 
shall never die." 

8) Item, so he promised 13) David, 2 Sam. 


5) 1522: promised. 
6) 1522: lay. 
7) 1522: your head. 
8) 1522: trample his soles. 
9) 1522: his head. 
10) 1522: he promised to. 
11) 1522: In your seed shall all generations. 
12) 1522: justified. 
13) 1522: promised.

7, 12. when he said: "I will raise up your seed after you, 
who shall build an house for my name 1) and | will confirm 
the throne of his kingdom 2) forever. | will be his father, 
and he shall be my son" 2c. This is the kingdom of Christ, 
of which the gospel speaks, an everlasting kingdom, a 
kingdom of life, blessedness and righteousness, into 
which come out of the prison of sin and death all who 
believe. 

(9) Such promises of the Gospel are many more in 
the other prophets. As Micah 5, 1: "And thou Bethlehem 
Ephrathah, which art small among the thousands of 
Judah, out of thee shall come to me the Lord of Israel. 3) 
Item, Hosea on the 13th, v. 14: "I will redeem them from 
hell, and save them from death. Death, | will be a poison 
unto thee; hell, | will be a pestilence unto thee. 4) 

(10) Now the gospel is nothing else, 5) but a 
preaching of Christ, the Son of God and David, true God 
and man, who by his death and resurrection overcame 
sin, death and hell for us who believe in him. So that the 
gospel may be a short and a long speech, and one may 
describe it briefly, the other lazily. He describes it long 
who describes many works and words of Christ, as the 
four evangelists do. He, however, describes it briefly, 
who does not describe Christ's works, but recently shows 
how he overcame sin, death and hell by his death and 
resurrection, as St. Peter and St. Paul did. 6) He also 
describes how he is the only one who has the power to 
save those who believe in him. 

(11) Therefore see to it that you do not make of Christ 
a Moses, nor of the gospel a book of laws or doctrines, 
as has been done hitherto, and that some prefaces, even 
of St. Jerome, are heard. For the gospel does not actually 
demand our work, that we may become pious and 
blessed with it; indeed, it ver- 


1) 1522: me. 

2) 1522: fortify the chair of his kingdom. 

3) 1522: And you Bethlehem, you are small among the thousands of 
Judah, out of you shall come to me who is a duke to my people Israel. 

4) 1522: I will deliver them from the hand of death, from death I will save 
them. 

5) In the edition of 1522 it reads like this: So we see that there is no more 
than One Gospel; like only One Christ. Sintemal Gospel 2c. 

6) 1522: bys. 





7) But it requires faith in Christ, that he has overcome 
sin, death, and hell for us, and thus makes us godly, 
alive, and blessed, not by our work, but by his own 
work, death, and suffering, so that we may accept his 
death and victory 8) as if we had done it ourselves. 

12) But that Christ in the gospel gives many 
commands 9) and teachings, and interprets the law, 
is to be counted as all the other works and deeds of 
Christ. And as knowing his works and history is not 
yet knowing the true gospel, for you do not yet know 
that he has overcome sin, death, and the devil: so 
also this is not yet knowing the gospel, because you 
know such doctrine and commandment, but when the 
voice comes saying, Let Christ be thine own with life, 
doctrines, works, death, resurrection, and all that he 
is, has, does, and is able. 

13) So we also see that he does not urge, but 
kindly entices, and says: "Blessed are the poor" 2c. 
And the apostles use the word: "I exhort, | implore, | 
entreat", so that one can see everywhere how the 
gospel is not a law book, but actually 10) a sermon 
about the benefits of Christ, shown to us and given to 
us as our own, if we believe. Moses, however, in his 
books, drives, penetrates, oppresses, strikes and 
punishes horribly, because he is a law writer and 
driver. 

(14) Therefore, no law is given to a believer to 
justify him before God, 11) as St. Paul says, 1 Tim. 
1:9, because he is justified, alive and saved by faith. 
And he needs no more than to prove such faith by 
works 12). Yes, where faith is, he cannot keep 
himself; he proves himself, breaks forth by good 
works, confesses 13) and teaches such a gospel 
before men, and risks his life on it. And everything he 
lives and does, he does for the benefit of his 
neighbor, for his own good. 


7) 1522: only. 
8) 1522: Ueberwindens. 
9) 1522: Law. 
10) 1522: only. 
11) The words: "thereby - GOtt" are missing in 1522. 
12) "with works" is missing in 1522. 
13) 1522: breaks out and confesses. 


90 Erl. 63, 114-118. 
Not only to come to such grace, but also with body, 
goods and honor, as he sees that Christ has done for 
him, and so follows Christ's example. 

(15) This is what Christ meant, when he gave no 
other commandment than love, by which it should be 
known who are his disciples and righteous believers. 
For where works and love do not break forth, faith is 
not right, the gospel does not yet adhere, and Christ 
is not 1) rightly known. Behold, therefore, direct 
thyself into the books of the New Testament, that 
thou mayest know how to read them in this manner.

the New Testament.

1) From all these you can now judge rightly 
among all the books, and distinguish which are the 
best. For 3) John's gospel and St. Paul's epistles, 
especially those to the Romans, and St. Peter's first 
epistle, are the right core and marrow among all 
books, which should also be the first, and every 
Christian should be advised to read them first and 
foremost, and to learn them through

made daily reading as mean as daily bread. 

For in these you will not find much description of 
the works and miracles of Christ, but you will find a 
masterful account of how faith in Christ overcomes 
sin, death and hell, and gives life, righteousness and 
salvation, which is the true nature of the gospel, as 
you have heard. 

For if | should ever lack one thing, the works or the 
preaching of Christ, | would rather lack the works 
than his preaching. For the works help me nothing; 
but his words, they give life, as he himself says Joh. 
8,4) 51. Since John writes very few works of Christ, 
but very many of his sermons, and the other three 
evangelists describe many of his works, but few of 
his words, John's gospel is the most tender, right 
main gospel, and is far, far preferable to the other 
three, and is to be lifted higher. So also St. Paul's and 
Peter's epistles are far superior to the three Gospels 
of Matthew, Mark and Luke: 

4. summa, St. John's gospel and his first epistle, 
St. Paul's epistles, especially those to the Romans, 
Galatians, Ephesians, and St. Peter's first epistle, 
these are the books that show you Christ and teach 
you everything that is necessary and blessed for you 
to know, even though you never see or hear any 
other book or teaching. Therefore, St. Jacob's epistle 
is a rather dry epistle, since it has no evangelical 
character about it. But more about this in other 
prefaces.

1534. 


(1) This book is to be read and regarded, not as 
we have done, as if St. Lucas had written in it only 
the personal works or history of the apostles, as an 
example of good works or good life, as St. Augustine 
and many others have regarded it as the best 
example, that the apostles had all goods in common 
with the Christians 2c., which did not last long, and 
must cease in time; but let it be noted that St. Lucas, 
with this book, teaches all Christendom, to the end of 
the world, the right principal of Christian doctrine, 
namely, how we must all be justified by faith alone in 
JESUS Christ alone, without any help of the law or of 
our works. 

This is his most important opinion and reason for 
writing this book. That is why he so powerfully 
expounds not only the apostles' preaching of faith in 
Christ, how both Gentiles and Jews were justified by 
it without any merit or works, but also the examples 
and history of such teaching, how the Gentiles as 
well as the Jews were justified by the gospel alone, 
without the law, and how, as St. Peter testifies, God 
in such matters made no distinction between Jews 
and Jews. Peter testifies Cap. 10, 28. and 15, 9. that 
God did not make any distinction between Jews and 
Gentiles in such matters; but just as He gave the Holy 
Spirit to the Gentiles who lived without law through 
the gospel, so He also gave the same to the Jews 
through the gospel, and not through the law or 
because of their works and merits. In this book, 
therefore, set both the doctrine of faith and the 
examples of faith with one another. 


Therefore, this book should be called a gloss on 
the epistles of St. Paul. For what St. Paul teaches and 
does with words and sayings from the Scriptures, St. 
Lucas shows here and proves with examples and 
stories that it has happened and must happen as St. 
Paul teaches, namely, that no law or work makes men 
righteous, but only faith in Christ. And you will find 
here in this book a beautiful mirror in which you can 


see that it is true: Sola fides justificat, faith alone 
makes righteous. For there are all the examples and 
history in it, certain and comforting witnesses, which 
are not lying nor lacking to you. 

For then behold how St. Paul himself is converted. 
How Cornelius the Gentile was converted by the word 
of St. Peter, as the angel had told him that Peter 
would preach to him, so that he would be saved. Item, 
the bailiff Sergius, and all the cities where St. Paul and 
Barnabas preached. See the first Concilium of the 
Apostles at Jerusalem, Cap. 15, 2. See all the 
sermons of St. Peter, Paul, Stephani and Philippi, and 
you will find that it all goes to this, that we must come 
to grace and be justified through the faith of Christ 
alone, without law and works. And with this book you 
can shut the mouths of the adversaries in a masterly 
and powerful way, who point us to the law and our 
works, and reveal their foolish ignorance to the whole 
world. 

(5) Therefore Lucas also says that such examples 
of faith made even the devout Jews (who had become 
believers) almost distraught.

and the other unbelieving Jews became mad and 
foolish about it. This was no wonder, because they 
were brought up in the Law and had been 
accustomed to it since Abraham, and it must have 
been annoying that the Gentiles, who were without 
Law and God, should be like them in the grace of 
God. 

(6) But that our people, who are all Gentiles, 
should blaspheme and persecute such an article is 
ten times worse, since we see here, and cannot 
deny, that God's grace and Christ's knowledge came 
to our ancestors without law and merit, even in 
abominable idolatries and vices. But they will gain as 
much from their blasphemy and persecution as the 
Jews gained from their raging and raging. 


have. For he who before had threatened the Jews 
and had Moses sing, "I will make you angry with him 
who is not my people, and | will make you mad with 
an ignorant people"; and Hosea Cap. 2, 23: "I will call 
my people that is not my people" (that is, those who 
live without law and work), and have kept it to them; 
the same one also threatens this to our blasphemers, 
and, as he has already well begun, 1) he will certainly 
keep it to them. But they will not believe this until they 
learn it (like the Jews), amen. 


1) We have deleted the brackets around the words: "as he has already 
begun", because they are not a parenthesis. In the old prints the brackets are 
often used to emphasize something. 





Preface from the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans, *) 


1522. 


(1) This epistle is the true chief of the New 
Testament, and the most pure gospel, which is well 
worthy and worthy that a Christian man should not 
only know it by heart from word to word, but should 
handle it daily, as the daily bread of the soul. For it 
can never be read or considered too much and too 
well, and the more it is handled, the more delicious it 
becomes and tastes great. 

2 Therefore | will also do my service to it, and 
prepare an entrance to it through this preface, as 
much as God has given me, so that it may be 
understood all the better by everyone. For it is 
hitherto darkened with glosses and various gossip, 
which is nevertheless a bright light in itself, almost 
sufficient to illuminate the whole of Scripture. 

First of all, we must know the language and what 
St. Paul means by these words: law, sin, grace, faith, 
righteousness, flesh, spirit, and the like, otherwise 
there is no use in reading them. 





4 You must not understand the word "law" here in 
a human way, that it is a teaching what works are to 
be done or not to be done, as it is with human laws, 
since one does enough for the law with works, if the 
heart is already not there. God judges according to 
the heart. Therefore, his law also demands the 
heart's reason and does not allow him to be satisfied 
with works, but rather punishes works done without 
the heart's reason as hypocrisy and lies. Therefore all 
men are called liars, Ps. 116:11, because no one can 
keep God's law out of his heart, for everyone finds in 
himself a reluctance to do good and a desire to do 
evil. Where there is no free desire to do good, there 
is no reason in the heart to keep the law of God; there 
is certainly sin and wrath deserved by God, even 
though there are many good works and honorable 
deeds in the heart. Therefore St. Paul concludes Cap. 
2, 12. 13. that the Jews are all sinners, and says that 
only the doers of the law are righteous.

by God. He means that no one is a perpetrator with 
works of the law, but rather says to them, v. 22: "You 
teach that one should not commit adultery, and you 
break marriage"; item, v. 1: "In which you judge 
another, you condemn yourself, because you do the 
same thing that you judge. As if to say, "You live 
outwardly in the works of the law, and judge those 
who do not live this way, and know how to teach 
everyone; you see the mote in another's eye, but you 
are not aware of the beam in your own eye [Matt. 7:3]. 

(6) For though you keep the law by heart with 
works, out of fear of punishment or love of reward, 
yet you do everything without free desire and love for 
the law, but with unwillingness and compulsion, 
‘would rather do otherwise if the law were not. From 
this it is evident that you are hostile to the law from 
the bottom of your heart. What is it, then, that you 
teach others not to steal, if you yourself are a thief in 
heart, and outwardly would gladly be one if you 
could? Even though the outward work does not last 
long with such hypocrites. So you teach others, but 
not yourself; you do not know yourself what you 
teach, you have never understood the law. Yes, the 
law increases sin, as he says in the fifth chapter, v. 
20, so that man only becomes more hostile to it the 
more it demands that he cannot do. 

Therefore, in the seventh chapter, v. 14, he says: 
"The law is spiritual. What is this? If the law were 
corporeal, works would be enough for it; but since it 
is spiritual, no one does enough for it, unless 
everything you do is from the heart. But no one gives 
such a heart except God's Spirit, which makes a man 
like the law, so that he gains air to the law from the 
heart, and henceforth does everything not out of fear 
or compulsion, but out of a free heart. Thus the law is 
spiritual, which wants to be loved and filled with such 
a spiritual heart, and demands such a spirit. Where 
this is not in the heart, there remains. sin, 
unwillingness, enmity against the law, which is good, 
just and holy. 

8 Get used to the idea that "doing the work of the 
law" and "fulfilling the law" are two different things. 
The work of the law 





is everything that man does, or can do, by the law, 
out of his own free will and powers. But because 
under and beside such works there remains in the 
heart unwillingness and compulsion to the law, such 
works are all lost and of no use. This is what St. Paul 
means Cap. 3, 20, when he says: "By the work of the 
law no man is justified in the sight of God." Therefore, 
you see that the school-baiters and sophists are 
deceivers when they teach that they prepare 
themselves for grace by works. How can one prepare 
himself for good by works who does no good work 
without unwillingness and displeasure in his heart? 
How can a work please God if it comes from an 
unenthusiastic and unwilling heart? 

(9) But to fulfill the law is to do one's works with 
love and love, and to live freely without the constraint 
of the law, divinely and well, as if there were no law 
or punishment. The Holy Spirit gives such a desire for 
free love into the heart, as he says in Cap. 5, 5. But 
the Spirit is not given only in, with and through faith in 
Jesus Christ, as he says in the preface. So faith does 
not come without God's word or gospel alone, which 
preaches Christ, as He is the Son of God and man, 
dead and risen for our sake, as he says in the third 
[v. 25], fourth [v. 25] and tenth chapters [v. 9]. 

(10) Hence it is that faith alone justifies and fulfills 
the law, for it brings the Spirit out of Christ's merit. But 
the Spirit makes the heart merry and free, as the law 
requires; so then good works proceed from faith itself. 
This is what he means Cap. 3, 31, after he had 
rejected the works of the law, that it reads as if he 
wanted to abolish the law through faith. No (he says), 
"we establish the law by faith," that is, we fulfill it by 
faith. 

11 In Scripture, "sin" means not only the outward 
work of the body, but all the business that is involved 
in and leads to the outward work, namely, the 
foundation of the heart, with all its strength. So that 
the word "do" means when a person completely falls 
away and goes into sin. For there is no outward work 
of sin, fora man goes completely down with body and 
soul. And especially the scripture looks into the heart, 


98 Erl. 3, 1L3-IL5. 


Prefaces by D. Martin Luther. W. xiv, 113-115. 


99 





and to the root and main source of all sin, which is 
unbelief at the bottom of the heart. So that as faith 
alone makes righteous, and brings the spirit and 
desire to good outward works, so unbelief alone sins, 
and brings up the flesh, and desire to evil outward 
works, as happened to Adam and Heva in paradise, 
Gen. 3:6. 

(12) Therefore Christ alone calls unbelief sin, 
when he says John 16:8, 9: "The Spirit will punish the 
world for sin, because they have not believed in me. 
Therefore, before good or evil works are done, as the 
good or evil fruit, there must first be faith or unbelief 
in the heart, as the root, sap and main force of all sin, 
which in Scripture is also called the head of the 
serpent and the head of the old dragon, which the 
seed of the woman, Christ, must crush, as Adam was 
promised. Genesis 3:15. 

13 "Grace" and "gift" are distinguished by the fact 
that grace actually means God's grace or favor, 
which He bears to us in Himself, from which He is 
inclined to pour Christ and the Spirit into us with His 
gifts, as is clear from the fifth chapter, v. 15, where 
He says: "Grace and gift in Christ" 2c. Although the 
gifts and the spirit in us increase daily, and are not 
yet perfect, so that evil desires and sin still remain in 
us, which fight against the spirit, as he says Rom. 7, 
14. f. 23. and Gal. 5, 17. and as Gen. 3, 15. 
proclaims, the strife between the seed of the woman 
and the seed of the serpent, yet grace does so much 
that we are counted completely and fully righteous 
before God. For his grace does not divide and 
separate itself, as the gifts do, but receives us wholly 
into 1) grace, for the sake of Christ our Advocate and 
Mediator, and [because] the gifts have begun in us. 

14 So you understand the seventh chapter, where 
St. Paul still calls himself a sinner, and yet in the 
eighth, v. 1, he says that there is nothing 
condemnable about those who are in Christ, because 
of the imperfect gifts and the Spirit. For the sake of 
the undying flesh 


1) "in" is in the Weimar Bible, but is missing in the Erlangen edition. 





we are still sinners; but because we believe in Christ 
and have the beginning of the Spirit, God is so 
favorable and gracious to us that He will not regard 
such sin nor judge it, but will continue with us by faith 
in Christ until sin is put to death. 

(15) "Faith" is not the human delusion and dream 
that some take for faith. And when they see that no 
improvement of life nor good works follow, and yet 
they can hear and speak much of faith, they fall into 
error, and say: Faith is not enough; one must do 
works if one is to become pious and blessed. That is 
why, when they hear the gospel, they fall, and by their 
own efforts make a thought in their hearts, saying, | 
believe. They consider this to be a true faith. But as it 
is a human thought and thought, which the reason of 
the heart never knows, so it does nothing, and no 
improvement follows after it. 

But faith is a divine work in us, which transforms 
us and gives us new birth from God, John 1:13, and 
kills the old Adam, makes us completely different 
people in heart, courage, mind and all powers, and 
brings the Holy Spirit with it. Oh, there is a living, 
busy, active, powerful thing about faith, that it is 
impossible that it should not work good without 
ceasing. Nor does he ask whether good works are to 
be done, but before he asks, he has done them, and 
is always doing them. But he who does not do such 
works is a faithless man, groping and looking about 
for faith and good works, and knowing neither what 
faith nor good works are, yet washing and babbling 
much talk of faith and good works. 

17 Glanbe is a living, bold confidence in God's 
grace, so certain that he would die a thousand times 
over. And such confidence and knowledge of divine 
grace makes one cheerful, defiant and merry toward 
God and all creatures, which the Holy Spirit does in 
faith. Therefore, man 2) becomes willing and joyful 
without compulsion to do good to everyone, to serve 
everyone, to suffer all kinds of things. 


2) "Man" is missing from the Erlanger, but is in the Weimar Bible. 


100 En. 63, 125-128. prefaces to the German Bible translation. W. xrv, 15-18. 101 





For the love and praise of God, who has shown him 
such grace, so that it is impossible to separate works 
from faith, indeed as impossible as burning and 
shining can be separated from fire. Therefore, 
beware of your own false thoughts and useless 
talkers, who want to be wise in judging from faith and 
good works, and are the greatest fools. Ask God to 
work faith in you, otherwise you will remain eternally 
without faith, you will be dense and do what you want 
or can. 

18. "Righteousness" then is such faith, and is 
called God's righteousness, or that which is valid 
before God, because it gives God, and counts for 
righteousness, for the sake of Christ, our Mediator, 
and makes man give to everyone what he owes. For 
by faith man becomes sinless, and gains pleasure in 
God's commandments; thereby he gives his glory to 
God, and pays Him what he owes Him; but to men he 
willingly serves what he can, and thereby also pays 
everyone. Such justice cannot be achieved by nature, 
free will, and our powers. For as no one can give him 
faith by himself, so he cannot take away unbelief; how 
then will he take away a few small sins? Therefore 
everything that happens apart from faith or in unbelief 
is false, hypocritical and sinful, Rom. 14:23, however 
good it may be. 

19. You must not understand "flesh" and "spirit" 
here to mean that "flesh" alone refers to unchastity 
and "spirit" to the inner part of the heart, but flesh is 
called by St. Paul, like Christ, John 3:6.Therefore, you 
should also know to call him "carnal" who, without 
grace, writes, teaches and prattles much about high 
spiritual things; as you can well learn from the works 
of the flesh, Gal. 5:20, since he also calls heresy and 
hatred the works of the flesh. And Rom. 8:3 says that 
the law is weakened by the flesh, which is not said of 
unchastity, but of all sins, but mostly of unbelief, 
which is the most spiritual vice. 





20 Again, also call "spiritual" him that worketh in 
the most outward works, as Christ when he washed 
the disciples' feet, and Peter when he led the ship and 
fished. So that the flesh is a man who lives and works 
inwardly and outwardly for the benefit of the flesh and 
temporal life, and the spirit is a man who lives and 
works inwardly and outwardly for the benefit of the 
spirit and life to come. 

Without such an understanding of these words, 
you will never understand this epistle of St. Paul, 
which is not yet a book of holy scripture. Therefore, 
beware of all teachers who use these words 
differently, whoever they may be, whether they be 
Jerome, Augustine, Ambrose, Origen, and their like, 
and even higher. Now let us turn to the epistle. 

(22) Since it behooves an evangelical preacher, 
first of all, by revealing the law and sins, to punish and 
make sinful everything that is not lived out of the spirit 
and faith in Christ, so that men may be led to their own 
knowledge and sorrow, that they may become humble 
and desire help, St. Paul also does this, beginning in 
the first chapter and punishing the gross sins and 
unbelief that were public in the day when the Gentiles 
were and are still sinning without God's grace. Paul 
also begins in the first chapter and punishes the gross 
sins and unbelief that are public in the day when the 
sins of the Gentiles were and still are, those who live 
without God's grace, saying that God's wrath from 
heaven is revealed through the gospel against all men 
because of their ungodly nature and unrighteousness. 
For although they know and daily recognize that there 
is one God, yet their nature is so evil in itself, apart 
from grace, that they neither thank nor honor Him, but 
blind themselves, and fall into wickedness without 
ceasing, until, after idolatry, they also commit the 
most shameful sins with all vices, unashamedly, and 
in addition leave others unpunished. 

In the second chapter, he also extends such 
punishment to those who seemed outwardly pious, or 
who secretly sinned when the Jews were, and are still 
all hypocrites who live well [and respectably] 1) 
without lust and love, 


1) The words “und ehrbarlich" are missing in the Erlangen edition,

and are hostile to God's law in their hearts, and yet 
like to judge other people, as is the way of all sinners, 
that they consider themselves pure, and yet are full 
of avarice, hatred, pride and all filthiness, Matth. 23, 
25. They are the ones who despise God's goodness 
and heap wrath upon themselves according to their 
hardness, so that St. Paul, as a right lawyer, leaves 
no one without sin, but proclaims the wrath of God to 
all who want to live well by nature or free will. Paul, 
as a true lawyer, lets no one remain without sin, but 
proclaims the wrath of God to all who by nature or 
free will want to live well, and lets them be no better 
than public sinners; indeed, he says they are hard- 
hearted and impenitent. 

24) On the third day he threw them both into one 
heap, saying: "Let one be like the other, all sinners 
before God, without the Jews having had God's word; 
although many did not believe it, yet God's faith and 
truth are not finished. And by chance he introduces 
the saying from the 51st Psalm, v. 6, that God 
remains righteous in his words. After that he comes 
back to it, and also proves by scripture that they are 
all sinners, and by the work of the law no one is 
justified, but the law was only given to recognize sin. 

25. After this he begins and teaches the right way 
how one must become pious and blessed, and says: 
"They are all sinners, and lack the glory which they 
ought to have in God, 1) but must be justified without 
merit" through faith in Christ, who has merited this for 
us through His blood, and has become for us a mercy 
seat from God, forgiving all our former sins; so that 
He may prove that His righteousness, which He gives 
by faith, alone helps us, which was revealed at that 
time through the Gospel, and testified beforehand 
through the Law and the Prophets. So the law is 
established by faith, although the works of the law are 
put down with it, along with their glory. 

26) On the fourth, when sin is revealed through the 
first three chapters, and the way of faith to 
righteousness is taught, he begins to meet with some 
pleas and claims, and first of all he takes the one 
whom 


1) In the first edition instead of: "and lack - should": "and without God's 
glory". 





All who hear of faith do commonly, how it justifies 
without works, saying, Shall one do no good works? 
So he himself holds up Abraham, saying, What did 
Abraham do with his works, was it all in vain? Were 
his works of no use? And he condemns that Abraham 
was justified by faith alone, without any works, so that 
even before the work of his circumcision he is justified 
by the Scriptures because of his faith alone, Genesis 
15:6. If the work of circumcision did nothing for his 
righteousness, which God commanded him to do, 
and was a good work of obedience, then certainly no 
other good work will do anything for righteousness, 
but as the circumcision of Abraham was an outward 
sign, so that he proved his righteousness in faith, so 
all good works are only outward signs that follow from 
faith, and prove, as the good fruits, that man is 
already righteous before God inwardly. 

With this, St. Paul confirms his previous teaching 
in the third chapter, v. 27, about faith, as with a strong 
example from Scripture, and also cites a witness, 
David, from the 32nd Psalm, who also says that a 
man is justified without works; although he does not 
remain without works when he has been justified. 
Then he sets the example against all the other works 
of the law, and concludes that the Jews cannot be 
Abraham's heirs because of blood alone, much less 
because of the work of the law, but must inherit 
Abraham's faith if they want to be true heirs, since 
Abraham was justified by faith before your law, both 
Mosiah and circumcision, and is called the father of 
all believers. For this cause also the law worketh 
wrath rather than grace, because no man doeth it with 
pleasure and love, that rather disgrace than grace 
cometh by the work of the law. Therefore faith alone 
must obtain the grace promised by Abraha. For these 
examples also are written for our sakes, that we also 
should believe. 

28) In the fifth place, he comes to the fruits and 
works of faith, which are peace, joy, love toward God 
and toward everyone, as well as security, defiance, 
joyfulness, courage and hope. 


104 Eri. 63, 130-133. Prefaces to the German Bible translation. W. xiv, 120-123.

ntribution in affliction and suffering. For all these 
things follow, where faith is right, because of the 
abundant good that God has shown us in Christ, in 
that he sent him to die for us before we could ask him, 
even while we were still enemies. So then we have 
that faith without all works justifies, and yet it does not 
follow from this that one should therefore do no good 
works, but that the righteous works do not remain 
outside, of which the saints of works know nothing, 
and seal up their own works, in which there is neither 
peace, joy, security, love, hope, nor defiance of any 
right Christian work and faith. 

29) After this, he makes an airy departure and 
walk, and tells where both sin and unrighteousness, 
death and life, come from; and holds the two finely 
against each other, Adam and Christ. This is why 
Christ had to come, another Adam, who inherited his 
righteousness on us through a new, spiritual birth in 
faith, just as that Adam inherited sin on us through the 
old fleshly birth. 

(30) This proves and confirms that no one can help 
him even from sins to righteousness with works, as 
little as he can prevent himself from being born in the 
flesh. This is also proven by the fact that the divine 
law, which was supposed to help righteousness, has 
not only come without help, but has also increased 
sin, so that the more the law resists it, the more the 
evil nature becomes hostile to it, and the more it wants 
to atone for its lust. So that the law makes Christ even 
more necessary, and demands more grace to help 
nature. 

(31) On the sixth, he sets before him the special 
work of faith, the contending of the Spirit with the 
flesh, to put to death the rest of the sins and lusts that 
remain after righteousness, teaching us that we are 
not so freed from sins by faith that we should be idle, 
slothful, and secure, as if sin were no more. There is 
sin, but it is not counted for condemnation because of 
the faith that contends with it. Therefore we have 
enough to do with ourselves all our lives, that we tame 
our body, kill a lust, and its members. 





To the extent that they are obedient to the Spirit and 
not to the lusts, that we may be conformed to the 
death and resurrection of Christ, and complete our 
baptism (which also means the death of sins and new 
life of grace), until we are completely clean from sins, 
also bodily resurrected with Christ and live forever. 

32 And this we can do, saith he, because we are 
in grace, and not under the law. Which he himself 
interprets, that to be without law is not so much to say 
that one has no law, and may do what anyone 
desires, but to be under the law is when we deal with 
law works without grace. Then sin certainly reigns 
through the law, since no one is naturally fond of the 
law; but this is great sin. But grace makes the law 
pleasant to us; so there is no more sin, and the law is 
no longer against us, but one with us. 

But the same is the right freedom from sin and 
from the law, of which he writes to the end of this 
chapter, that it is a freedom to do only good with 
pleasure, and to live well without the constraint of the 
law. Therefore freedom is a spiritual freedom, which 
does not abolish the law, but gives what is demanded 
by the law, namely lust and love, so that the law is 
satisfied, and has no more to drive and demand. As 
if you owed a feudal lord and could not pay. You 
would like to get rid of him in two ways: first, so that 
he would not take anything from you and would break 
his register; and second, so that a pious man would 
pay for you and give to you, so that you would do 
enough for his register. In this way Christ has set us 
free from the law. Therefore it is not a wild, carnal 
liberty, which should do nothing, but which does 
much and all things, and is free from the law's 
demand and guilt. 

34 On the seventh, he confirmed this with an 
equality of conjugal life. When a husband dies, the 
wife is also unmarried, and is thus free of one 
another. This does not mean that the wife may not or 
should not take another husband, but rather that she 
is now free to take another husband, which she could 
not do before she was free from that husband. 

So our conscience is connected to the 


106 Erl. 63, i3s-i35. 


Prefaces by D. Martin Luther. W. xi v, 123-125. 


107 





Law, under the sinful old man; when he is killed by the 
Spirit, the conscience is free, and one is rid of the 
other. Not that the conscience should do nothing, but 
that it should first of all cling to Christ, the other man, 
and bear fruit of life. 

(36) Then he goes on to describe the nature of 
sins and the law, how through the law sin now 
becomes quite active and powerful. For the old man 
becomes only the more hostile to the law, because he 
cannot pay what is demanded by the law. For sin is 
his nature, and nothing else can come from him; 
therefore the law is his death and all his torment. Not 
that the law is evil, but that the evil nature cannot 
suffer good to be demanded of it, just as a sick person 
cannot suffer to be demanded to run and jump and 
other works of a healthy person. 

(37) Therefore St. Paul here concludes that where 
the law is rightly discerned and well understood, it 
does no more, for it reminds us of our sin, and by the 
same kills us, and makes us guilty of eternal wrath, 
as all this is finely taught and experienced in the 
conscience when it is rightly met with the law, so that 
one must have something else and more than the law 
to make man godly and blessed. But those who do 
not rightly recognize the law are blind, they go there 
presumptuously, they think they have done enough 
with works, because they do not know how much the 
law requires, namely a voluntary, merry heart; 
therefore they do not see Mosi rightly under their 
eyes, the cloth is put in front of them and covered. 

(38) Then he shows how the spirit and the flesh 
contend with each other in one man, and sets himself 
as an example, that we may learn to know the work 
(to kill sin in ourselves) aright. He calls both the spirit 
and the flesh one law, because just as the divine law 
drives and demands, so also the flesh drives and 
demands and rages against the spirit, and wants its 
pleasure. Again the spirit drives and demands against 
the flesh, and wants to have its pleasure. This quarrel 
lasts in us as long as we live, in one more, in the other 
less. 


1) Jonas: in uno et eodem homine. 


after which the spirit or flesh becomes stronger. And 
yet the whole man himself is both spirit and flesh, 
contending with himself until he becomes wholly 
spiritual. 

39) In the eighth place, he comforts such fighters 
that such flesh does not condemn them, and further 
shows what is the nature of the flesh and the nature of 
the Spirit, and how the Spirit comes from Christ, who 
has given us his Holy Spirit, who makes us spiritual 
and subdues the flesh, assuring us that we are 
nevertheless children of God, however hard sin rages 
in us, as long as we follow the Spirit and resist sin to 
kill it. But since nothing is so good to deceive the flesh 
as the cross and suffering, he comforts us in suffering 
by the help of the Spirit of love and of all creatures, 
namely, that both the Spirit groan in us, and the 
creature longs with us, that we may be rid of the flesh 
and of sins. So we see that these three chapters, 6., 
7., 8., are driving towards the one work of faith, which 
is called killing the old Adam and forcing the flesh. 

In the ninth, tenth and eleventh chapters, he 
teaches about the eternal providence of God, which is 
why it originally begs who should believe or not 
believe, who can be freed from sins or not; so that it 
may ever be taken out of our hands altogether and 
placed in God's hand alone, that we may become 
godly. And this is also most necessary. For we are so 
weak and uncertain that, if it were up to us, not one 
person would be saved, but the devil would surely 
overpower them all. But now that God is certain that 
He will not fail in His providence, nor can anyone resist 
Him, we still have hope against sin. 

But here a mark is to be put on the wicked and 
arrogant spirits, who first lead their minds here and 
start up to search the abyss of divine providence 
beforehand, and in vain worry about whether they are 
provided for. They must then fall themselves, that they 
either despair, or strike themselves into the open 
redoubt. 

42. but follow this epistle in its order, first be 
concerned with Christ and the gospel, that you may 
know your sin and his grace, then contend with sin, as 
taught here in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th 
chapters. After that, if you

109 





When you have come to the eighth chapter, to the 
cross and suffering, the verse in the 9th, 10th [and] 
11th chapters will teach you rightly how comforting it 
is. For without suffering, the cross and the hardships 
of death, the verse cannot be acted without harm and 
secret anger against God. Therefore Adam must first 
be dead before he suffers this thing and drinks the 
strong wine. Therefore, beware that you do not drink 
wine while you are still an infant. Every teaching has 
its measure, time and age. 

In the twelfth, he teaches the right worship, and 
makes all Christians priests, that they should 
sacrifice, not money nor cattle, as in the law, but their 
own bodies, with the killing of lusts. He then describes 
the outward conduct of Christians in spiritual 
government, how they should teach, preach, govern, 
serve, give, suffer, love, live and do toward friend, foe 
and everyone. These are the works that a Christian 
does. For, as has been said, faith does not celebrate. 

44 On the thirteenth, he teaches the secular 
government to honor and obey, which was 
established for this reason: although it does not make 
people righteous in the sight of God, it does so much 
that the righteous have outward peace and 
protection, and the wicked cannot freely do evil 
without fear, or with peace and tranquility. Therefore 
it is to be honored, even for the pious, whether they 
may not be. Finally, however, he puts everything into 
love, and infuses it into the example of Christ, as he 
did to us, that we also do likewise and follow him. 

In the fourteenth, he teaches to guide the weak 
consciences in faith carefully and to spare them, so 
that the freedom of Christians is not used to harm but 
to promote the weak. For where this is not done, 
discord and contempt for the gospel follow, in which 
all need lies; that it is better to give way a little to the 
weak believers until they become stronger, than that 
the teaching of the gospel should perish. And such a 
work is a special work of love, which is also 
necessary now, since the weak consciences are 
shaken with meat-eating and other freedom, boldly 
and harshly, without any need, 1) before they 
recognize the truth. 


1) Thus the first edition. Weimar Bible: "shattered". Jonas: laedunt. 





46. on the fifteenth he sets Christ as an example, 
that we also tolerate the other weak, as those who are 
otherwise infirm, in public sins, or of unpleasant 
manners; whom it is not necessary to cast down, but 
to bear until they also become better. For so Christ 
hath done with us, and doeth daily, that he beareth 
unto us much iniquity and wickedness, beside all 
imperfection, and helpeth without ceasing. 

47. After this, in conclusion, he prays for them, 
praises them, and commends them to God, and 
shows his ministry and preaching, and asks them 
very neatly for taxation to the poor of Jerusalem; and 
is all love, which he speaks of and deals with. 

48. 2) The last chapter is a greeting chapter; But 
under it he mixes a noble warning against the 
doctrines of men, which invade alongside the 
evangelical doctrine and cause trouble, just as if he 
had certainly foreseen that from Rome and through 
the Romans would come the seductive, annoying 
Canons and Decretales, and the whole canker and 
worm of human laws and commandments, which 
have now drowned all the world, and have destroyed 
this epistle and all holy Scripture, together with the 
spirit and faith, so that nothing is left but the idolatrous 
belly, whose servant St. Paul here chides them. Paul 
chides them. God deliver us from them, Amen! 

In this epistle, then, we find in abundance what a 
Christian should know about the law, the gospel, sin, 
punishment, grace, faith, righteousness, Christ, God, 
good works, love, hope, the cross, and how we 
should behave toward everyone, whether pious or 
sinner, strong or weak. Friend or foe, and against 
ourselves. In addition, all of this is well founded in 
scripture, with examples from himself and the 
prophets, so that nothing more is to be desired here. 
Therefore it seems as if St. Paul in this epistle wanted 
to summarize the whole Christian and evangelical 
doctrine and to prepare an entrance into the whole 
Old Testament. Without a doubt, whoever has this 
epistle in his heart has the light and power of the Old 
Testament with him. Therefore, let every Christian 
keep it in common and constant practice. God grant 
His grace, amen.

Preface from the first epistle to the Corinthians. *) 


1522 and 1545. 


In this epistle, St. Paul exhorts the Corinthians to be 
united in faith and doctrine, and to see that they learn 
well the main thing, namely, that Christ is our salvation, 
on which all reason and wisdom stumble. 

2. For just as now in our time, when the gospel has come 
to light, there are many foolish saints (who are called red 
spirits, enthusiasts and heretics), who have become 
wise and learned all too early, and in the face of great art 
and wisdom can keep themselves equal or in harmony 
with no one: One wants to go out here, the other out 
there, as if it were a great disgrace if each one did not 
advance something special and throw up his own 
wisdom, which in turn cannot make fools of anyone, 
since they basically neither know nor understand 
anything about the real main thing, even though they talk 
about it a lot with their mouths. 

(3) In the same way, when St. Paul had taught 
his Corinthians the Christian faith and freedom from the 
law, the foolish saints and unseasonable men of learning 
found each other, broke up the united teaching, and 
made division among the believers. One wanted to be 
Pauline, the other Apollonian, one Petrine, the other 
Christian. One wanted circumcision, the other did not. 
One wanted marriage, the other did not. One wanted to 
eat things sacrificed to idols, the other did not. Some 
wanted to be free in body, some wanted to walk in hair, 
and the like, until they came to the point that one abused 
his freedom and took his stepmother in marriage, and 
some thought nothing of the resurrection of the dead, 
and some not much of the sacrament; and it went on 
wildly and quite disorderly, that everyone wanted to be 
master, and to teach, and to do with the gospel, 
sacrament, and faith, as seemed good to him. And in the 
meantime they left the main thing, that Christ is our 
salvation, righteousness, and redemption, as if they had 
long since torn it to shreds. How then 





Such piece can not stay on the track, where mail begins 
to be clever and wise. 

4. all things, as it is also now with us: after we have 
opened the gospel to the Germans, by the grace of God, 
each one also wants to be the best master and to have 
the Holy Spirit alone, just as if the gospel was preached 
for this reason, that we should show our wisdom and 
reason in it and seek glory, so that these Corinthians 
may well be an example to our people at this time, who 
also need such an epistle. But it must be so, and should 
be so according to the Gospel, that foolish saints and 
unseasonable men of wisdom cause trouble and 
distress, so that those who have proved themselves (as 
St. Paul also says here) may be revealed. 

For this reason St. Paul severely punishes and 
condemns such harmful wisdom. And makes such nosy 
saints fools again, saying badly that they know nothing 
of Christ nor of the spirit and gifts of God given to us in 
Christ, and should still begin to learn. They must be 
spiritual people who understand. Wanting to be wise and 
pretending to be clever in the Gospel is just the right 
trouble and hindrance to recognize Christ and God. To 
stir up mobs and discord, clever reason and wisdom may 
well serve to make vain mad saints and wild Christians. 
But they may never recognize our Lord Christ; they 
become fools again, and let themselves be humbly 
taught and led by the simple word of God. This is what 
he does in the first four chapters. 

In the fifth, he punishes the great fornication of the 
one who took his stepmother and wants to banish him 
and give him to the devil. This indicates that he needs a 
proper way of banishment, that he is to be cast over the 
public vices with the approval of the believing 
community, as Christ also teaches in Matth. 18, 17.

preface is also found in the Hall volume, p. 153. 


112 Erl. 83, 140-142. 
(7) In the sixth, he punishes wrangling and 
quarreling in the courts, especially before the 
heathen and unbelievers, and teaches that they 
should settle matters among themselves or suffer 
injustice. 

In the seventh, he gives instruction on chastity and 
marital status. Praise chastity and virginity, that they 
are useful to wait for the gospel, as Christ also 
teaches Matth. 19, 12. about the chaste, who are 
chaste for the sake of the gospel or the kingdom of 
heaven. But Paul wants to keep them free and 
unconstrained, and without a greater sin; otherwise it 
is better to be free than chastity, which is in constant 
heat. 

(9) In the eighth to the twelfth he deals with 
various ways of guiding and keeping weak 
consciences in external matters, such as eating, 
drinking, clothing, and having the sacrament. He also 
warns that the strong should not despise the weak, 
since he himself, even though he is an apostle, has 
abstained from many things, since he would be right 
to do so. For this the strong may well be afraid, 
because so many perished in Israel a long time ago, 
who were all brought out of Egypt by miracles. And 
makes beside it some information of wholesome 
doctrine. 

(10) In the twelfth and thirteenth, he deals with 
how there are various gifts of God, among which love 
is the best, that they should not rise up, but serve one 
another with one accord, because it is One God, One 
Lord, One Spirit, and all One, however diverse it may 
be. 

In the fourteenth he teaches the preachers, 


1) "zu" is missing in the Erlanger, but is in the Weimar Bible. 
2) In the original: bis aufs. 





Prefaces to the German Bible translation. W. xiv, 131.113 


Prophets and singers, that they use their gifts 
properly, and only for the betterment, not for their 
own honor, preach their sermons, art and intellect. 

In the fifteenth he punishes those who have taught 
and believed wrongly about the resurrection of the 
flesh. 

In the last he exhorts them to brotherly help in 
temporal food for the needy. 


1. 3) The epistle to the Romans was written by St. 
Paul about faith and works, almost properly. But in 
this first one, to the Corinthians, he addresses 
various things that have arisen from it. 

(2) And in the first place, he deals with how the 
gospel does not rhyme with worldly wisdom; and 
finally, that nature and the cross are contrary to each 
other, that human wisdom does not suffer God's 
wisdom. 

In the third and fourth chapters he teaches what 
the apostles should be considered. For the sects 
came from preferring some apostles to others, just as 
the Greek and Roman churches were divided over 
St. Peter. 

4th On the fifth, he teaches the right ban, that 
public sinners should be punished and not suffer. 

On the sixth, he punishes the judicial acts as 
unchristian beings. 

On the seventh he gives instruction in chastity, 
first to widows (as he himself was), second to married 
women, third to virgins. 

7. from the eighth to the twelfth he acts in many 
ways 2c.

reads more briefly like this:

37 Preface to the other epistle to the Corinthians, *) 


1522. 


In the first epistle, St. Paul punished the 
Corinthians severely in many ways, and poured 
sharp wine into their wounds and frightened them; 
but now an apostle is supposed to be a comforting 
preacher, to raise up the frightened and stupid 
consciences, more than to frighten them, therefore 
he praises them again in this epistle, and also pours 
oil into the wounds, and does miraculous kindness to 
them, and calls the sinner to be received again with 
love. 

In the first and second chapters, he shows his love 

for them, how he has said, done and suffered 
everything for their benefit and salvation, so that they 
may have all the best for him. 
3) Then he praises the gospel ministry, which is the 
highest and most comforting work for the benefit and 
salvation of consciences, and shows how it is more 
noble than the ministry of the law, and how it is 
persecuted, yet increases in believers, and gives 
hope through the 





Cross, the eternal glory. But with all this, he touches 
the false apostles, who were driving the law against 
the gospel, and teaching vain outward holiness (that 
is, hypocrisy), leaving the inward shame of unbelief. 
He does this in the third, fourth and fifth chapters. 

In the sixth and seventh, he exhorts them to follow 
this preaching with works and suffering. And with 
their praise he besmirches them, that he may 
provoke them to continue. 

5 In the eighth and ninth he admonishes them that 
they also with temporal food do taxation and help to 
the saints of Jerusalem, in the precious time, who 
from the beginning had surrendered all their goods, 
Acts. 4, 32. 

6. in the tenth, eleventh [and] twelfth he has to 
deal with the false apostles. 

7. in the thirteenth, he gives warning to those who 
have been

Preface to the Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians, ) 


1522. 


(1) The Galatians were brought to the true 
Christian faith and the gospel of the law by St. Paul. 
But after his departure the false apostles, who were 
disciples of the true apostles, came and turned the 
Galatians again, so that they believed they had to be 
saved by the work of the law, and committed sin if 
they did not keep the work of the law, as Acts 15:1 
says. 15, 1. also some high people in Jerusalem. 

To counter these, 1) St. Paul exalts his ministry, 
and wants to be held no less than another apostle, 
and boasts of God alone about his doctrine and 
ministry, so that he can outdo the fame of the false 
apostles who claim to be the true apostle's work and 
name. 


1) to oppose - to counter, to confront. (Dietz.) 





and says, "It is not right if an angel preaches it 
differently, or if he himself preaches it differently, or 
if the apostle's disciples teach it differently, or if they 
themselves teach it differently. 

This is what he does in the first and second 
chapters, and he explains that without merit, without 
works, without law, but through Christ alone, 
everyone must be justified. 

In the third and fourth chapter he proves all this 
with scriptures, examples and parables, and shows 
how the law rather brings sin and cursing than 
righteousness, which is promised by God by grace 
alone, fulfilled through Christ without law and given 
to us. 

In the fifth and sixth, he teaches the works of love 
that should follow faith.

Preface from the Epistle of St. Paul to the Ephesians, *) 


1522. 


In this epistle, St. Paul first teaches what the 
gospel is, how it alone was provided by God in unity, 
and how it was earned and originated through Christ, 
so that all who believe in it may become righteous, 
godly, alive, blessed, and free from the law, sin, and 
death. He does this through the first three chapters. 
(2) Then he teaches us to avoid the secondary 
doctrines and the commandments of men, so that we 
may be bound to One. 


To abide in the head, to be sure, to become righteous 
and complete in Christ alone, in whom we have 
nothing apart from him. He teaches this in the fourth 
chapter. 

3 Henceforth he teaches to exercise and prove 
faith with good works, and to avoid sin, and to fight 
against the devil with spiritual weapons, so that 
through the cross we may stand in hope. 








Preface from the Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians, **) 


1522. 


(1) In this epistle St. Paul commends and exhorts 
the Philippians to continue in the right faith and to 
increase in love. Because the false apostles and 
false teachers of works always harm the faith, he 
warns them against them and shows them various 
preachers, some good, some bad, also himself and 
his disciples, Timothy and Epaphroditum; this he 
does in the first [and] second chapter. 

2. in the third, he rejects the faithless and 


Human righteousness, as taught and held by the 
false apostles, sets himself as an example, who lived 
gloriously in such righteousness, and yet now holds 
nothing of it, for the sake of Christ's righteousness. 
For that only makes the belly a god, and enemies of 
the cross of Christ. 

In the fourth, he exhorts them to peace and good 
outward behavior toward one another, thanking them 
for the gift they have sent him. 





Preface to the Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians. T) 


1522. 


(1) Just as the epistle to the Galatians is patterned 
after the epistle to the Romans, and summarizes the 
same with a short term, which the epistle to the 
Romans elaborates further and more richly, so this 
epistle to the Colossians is patterned after the epistle 
to the Ephesians, and also summarizes the same 
content with a short term. 

2) First of all, the apostle praises and wishes the 
Colossians to continue and increase in the faith, and 
he states what the gospel and faith are, namely, a 
wisdom that knows Christ as Lord and God, crucified 
for us, who came from the world. 





hidden, and now brought forth through his ministry. 
This is the first chapter. 

In the other chapter he warns them against the 
doctrines of men, which are always contrary to the 
faith, and paints them even as they are not painted 
anywhere in Scripture, and rebukes them masterfully. 

4 In the third, he exhorts them to be fruitful in the 
true faith with all kinds of good works toward one 
another, describing their own works to all kinds of 
people. 

In the fourth, he commands himself into their 
prayer, and greets and strengthens them.

42. preface from the first epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians, *) 


1522. 


This epistle is written by St. Paul out of special love 
and apostolic concern. For he praises them through the 
first two chapters, how they accepted the gospel from 
him with such earnestness that they also persevered in 
it through suffering and persecution, and became a 
beautiful example of faith to all the common people 
everywhere, and like Christ and his apostles, suffered 
persecution from the Jews, their own friends, as he 
himself had also suffered among them, as an example 
to them, and led a holy life among them. He thanked 
God that his gospel had produced such fruit among 
them. 

2. in the third, he shows his diligence and care that 
such his work and its praiseworthy beginning are not 
destroyed by the devil and his 





The apostles would be offended with the doctrines of 
men. That is why he sent Timothy to them beforehand 
to find out. He thanked God that it was still found to be 
true among them and wished them to increase. 

In the fourth, he exhorts them to beware of sins and 
to do good to one another. In addition, he answers a 
question they had asked him through Timothy about the 
resurrection of the dead, whether they will all be 
resurrected at the same time or one after the other. 

4 In the fifth, he writes about the last day, how it 
should come quickly and swiftly. He gives them some 
good orders to govern the others and how they should 
behave toward each other's lives and teachings. 


43, preface to the other epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians?*) 


1522. 


(1) In the first epistle, St. Paul had resolved a 
question for the Thessalonians about the last day, how 
it will come quickly as a thief in the night. As it happens 
that always one question gives birth to another, out of 
wrong understanding, the Thessalonians understood 
that the last day would already be there. Thereupon he 
writes this epistle and explains himself. 

In the first chapter he comforts them with the eternal 
reward of their faith and patience in all kinds of suffering, 
and with the punishment of their persecutors in eternal 
torment. 





In the second he teaches how before the last day the 
Roman empire must first fall, and the end-Christ must 
rise up for God in Christendom, and with false doctrines 
and signs deceive the unbelieving race, until Christ 
comes and destroys it with his glorious future, and with 
a spiritual sermon kills it first. 

In the third, he gives several admonitions, especially 
that they should punish the idle who do not support 
themselves with their own hands, and if they do not 
improve, they should avoid them.

44, preface from the first epistle of St. Paul to Timothy, *) 


1522. 


This epistle is written by St. Paul as an example to all 
bishops, what they 1) should teach and how they should 
govern Christianity in all ranks, so that there is no need 
to govern Christians out of their own human conceit. 

In the first chapter, he commands that a bishop keep 
the right faith and love, and resist the false preachers of 
the law, who besides Christ and the gospel also want to 
practice the works of the law. And summarize the whole 
Christian doctrine, what the law is for and what the 
gospel is. He sets himself as a comforting example to all 
sinners and afflicted consciences. 

3 In the second he commands to pray for all classes, 
and commands that the women should not preach, nor 
wear exquisite jewelry, but should be obedient to the 
men. 

4. in the third, he describes what kind of people the 
bishops or priests and their wives are. 


1) In the original: the. 





item, the church servants and their wives, and praise it if 
anyone desires to be a bishop of such a manner. 

In the fourth, he proclaims the false episcopal and 
ecclesiastical state, which is contrary to the foregoing, 
since such persons shall not be, but shall forbid marriage 
and food, and shall wholly do the contradiction with 
doctrines of men of the image which he hath signified. 

In the fifth, he commands how widows and young 
women are to be appointed, and which widows are to be 
fed from the common tax. Also, how pious and criminal 
bishops or priests are to be held in honor, or punished. 

In the sixth, he exhorts the bishops to adhere to the 
true gospel, to practice it with preaching and life, and to 
refrain from the useless, rash questions that are raised 
only to seek worldly glory and wealth. 


45, preface to the other epistle of St. Paul to Timothy.**) 


1522. 


This epistle is a last letter in which St. Paul exhorts 
Timothy to continue as he began in the work of the 
gospel, which is necessary because there are many who 
fall away, and false spirits and teachers are stirring up 
everywhere. Therefore, it is a bishop's duty to always 
watch over and work on the gospel. 


In particular, in the third and fourth chapters, he 
proclaims the perilous time at the end of the world, in 
which the false spiritual life shall seduce all the world 
with outward appearances, under which all kinds of 
wickedness and vice have their being; as, unfortunately, 
we now see this prophecy of St. Paul being all too 
abundantly fulfilled in our clergy.

46 Preface to the Epistle of St. Paul to Titum. *) 


1522. 


1. This is a short epistle, but an example of 
Christian doctrine, in which all the things that a 
Christian needs to know and live are so masterfully 
written. 

2 First, he teaches what kind of man a bishop or 
pastor should be, namely, one who is pious and 
learned to preach the gospel and to destroy the false 
teachers of works and the laws of men, who always 
fight against the faith and deceive the consciences 
from Christian freedom into the prison of their works 
of men, as if they were supposed to make people 
pious before God, which are of no use. 





In the other chapter, he teaches all classes, old, 
young, women, men, masters and servants, how 
they should conduct themselves as those whom 
Christ acquired for ownership through his death. 

In the third, he teaches to honor and obey the 
worldly rulers, and again calls attention to the grace 
that Christ has purchased for us, so that no one may 
think that it is enough to be obedient to the rulers, 
since all our righteousness is nothing before God. 
And commands to avoid the obstinate and heretics. 


47 Preface to the Epistle of St. Paul to Philemon. **) 


1522. 


This epistle shows a masterly, lovely example of 
Christian love. For there we see how St. Paul takes 
care of poor Onesimi and represents him against his 
Lord with all that he is able, and does not present 
himself otherwise than as if he himself were 
Onesimus who had sinned. 

(2) But he does not do this by force or coercion, as 
he would be right, but expresses his right, so that he 
compels Philemon to forgive himself of his right. 





Just as Christ did for us against God the Father, St. 
Paul also does for Onesimum against Philemon. For 
Christ has also declared himself right, and with love 
and humility has overcome the Father, so that he had 
to lay aside his wrath and justice, and take us into 
grace, for Christ's sake, who thus earnestly 
represents us, and so warmly takes care of us. For 
we are all his Onesimi, if we believe it. 


48) Preface to the first epistle of St, Peter. +) 


1522. 


This epistle was written by St. Peter to the 
converted Gentiles, exhorting them to be constant in 
the faith and to accept it through all kinds of suffering 
and good works. 


2 In the first chapter, he strengthens their faith 
with the divine promise and power of the 
blessedness to come, and shows how the same is 
not earned by us, but is first brought about by the

prophets. Therefore, they should live holy in the new 
being and forget the old, as they are born through the 
living, eternal Word of God. 

In the second, he teaches to recognize the head and 
the cornerstone, Christ, and that they, as righteous 
priests, sacrifice themselves to God as Christ sacrificed 
himself, and begins to teach all kinds of classes. First, 
he teaches in common, to be subject to worldly rule, then 
especially, to be subject to their own masters, and to 
suffer injustice from them for the sake of Christ, who also 
suffered injustice for us. 

4 In the third, he teaches women to be obedient, even 
to unbelieving men, and to be holy. Item, the men, that 
they 





tolerate and bear with their wives, and thereafter be 
humble, patient, and kind one to another, as Christ was 
to our sin. 

In the fourth, he teaches to constrain the flesh, to 
comfort and strengthen it with sobriety, watchfulness, 
temperance, prayer, and Christ's suffering. And he 
instructs the spiritual government, how to do God's word 
and work alone, and how to be of service to one another 
with one's gift, and not to be surprised, but to rejoice, if 
we must suffer for Christ's name's sake. 

In the fifth, he exhorts the bishops and priests how 
they should live and feed the people. And he warns us 
against the devil, that he will pursue us everywhere 
without ceasing. 


49 Preface to the other epistle of St. Peter*), 


1522. 


1 This epistle is written against those who think that 
Christian faith is without works. Therefore he exhorts 
them to test themselves by good works, and to be sure 
of the faith, just as trees are known by their fruit. 

(2) And after this begin to magnify the gospel against 
the doctrine of men, that the same only should be heard, 
and no doctrine of men. For when he said, "No prophecy 
has ever been made by the will of man." 

Therefore, in the second chapter, he warns against 
the false teachers of the future, who deal in works and 
thereby deny Christ. And he condemns them harshly 
with three horrible examples, depicting them with their 
avarice, arrogance, sacrilege, fornication and hypocrisy, 
so that it must be assumed that he is referring to today's 
spiritual state, which devours the whole world with its 
avarice and leads a free, carnal, worldly life. 

4. in the third, he shows that the last day will be 





will soon come; and though it seems to men a thousand 
years, yet in the sight of God it is as one day. 1) And he 
describes how it will happen on the last day, that 
everything will be consumed with fire. 2) But he also 
prophesies that at that time people will be quite mocking 
and will not believe in faith, like the Epicureans. 

Summa, the first chapter shows how Christianity 
should stand at the time of the pure Gospel. The second 
chapter shows how it would stand in the time of the pope 
and the doctrine of men. The third chapter shows how 
people will despise both gospels and all doctrine and 
believe nothing. And this is now going on in full swing 
until Christ comes. 


1) Here follows 1522: Now in the sight of God is everything that 
dies, but what lives is in the sight of men. Therefore, the last day is 
coming for everyone soon after his death. 

2) The following to the end is missing in the 1522 edition.

50: Preface to the three epistles of St. John. *) 


1522. 


1) The 1) first epistle of St. John is a righteous 
apostolic epistle and should follow soon after his 
gospel. For just as in the Gospel he urges faith, so in 
the epistle he meets those who boasted of faith 
without works, and teaches variously how works do 
not remain outside where faith is. But if they remain 
outside, faith is not righteous, but lies and darkness. 
But he does not do this by driving to the law, as 
Jacob's epistle does, but with appeals that we should 
also love as God has loved us. 

(2) He also writes hard against the Cerinthians 
and against the spirit of the Antichrist, which at that 
time already began to deny Christ, that he had come 
into the flesh, which is now really going on. For 
although one does not now deny with the 


1) Erlanger: This. 





Although they say publicly that Christ has come into 
the flesh, they deny it in heart, doctrine and life. For 
he that would be saved by his works and deeds does 
as much as he that denieth Christ, seeing that Christ 
came in the flesh to make us saved without our 
works, but by his blood alone. 

3 Thus the epistle contends against both parts, 
against those who want to be without works at all in 
faith, and against those who want to become godly 
with works. And keeps us on the right road, that we 
may become godly by faith, and be freed from sins, 
and after that, when we are godly, do good works and 
love for God's sake, freely without any request. 

The other two epistles are not doctrinal epistles, 
but examples of love and faith, and also have a 
proper apostolic spirit. 


51 Preface to the Epistle to the Hebrews. **) 


1522. 


So far we have had the right certain main books 
of the New Testament. But these four following ones 
have had a different reputation before. And first of all, 
that this epistle to the Hebrews was not written by St. 
Paul, nor by any apostle, is proven by the fact that in 
the second chapter, v. 3, it says: "This teaching came 
to us and remained through those who heard it from 
the Lord himself. This makes it clear that he is 
speaking of the apostles as a disciple to whom such 
teaching came from the apostles, perhaps lukewarm 
afterwards. For St. Paul Gal. 1, 1. powerfully testifies 
that he did not receive his gospel from any man, nor 
through any man, but from God Himself. 





(2) Over this it has a hard knot, that in the sixth 
and tenth chapters it flatly denies and denies 
repentance to sinners after baptism, and Cap. 12:17 
says, Esau sought repentance, and yet found it not. 
This, as it reads, seems to be contrary to all the 
Gospels and Epistles of St. Paul. And although one 
may make a gloss on it, the words are so clear that | 
do not know whether it is enough. It seems to me that 
it is an epistle composed of many pieces, and does 
not deal with one thing properly. 

3) As with all of these, it is a fine, concise epistle, 
which speaks of the priesthood of Christ masterfully 
and thoroughly from the Scriptures, and also 
interprets the Old Testament finely and abundantly. 





*) This preface is found in the Leipzig edition, vol. XII, p. 68 and in the Erlanger, vol. 63, p. 153. **) This preface is found in the Leipzig edition,

It is obvious that it is the work of an excellent, learned 
man who was a disciple of the apostles, learned much 
from them, and is almost experienced in the faith and 
practiced in the Scriptures. And even though he does 
not lay the foundation of faith, as he himself testifies, 
Cap. 6, 1, which is the apostles' office, he nevertheless 
builds on it gold, silver and precious stones, as St. Paul 
says in 1 Cor. 3, 12. Therefore, we should not be 
hindered by the fact that wood, straw or hay may have 
been mixed in. 





but to receive such fine doctrine with all honors, without 
being anything like the apostolic epistles. 

4 But he who has written them is unconscious and 
will remain unconscious for a while; there is nothing in it. 
Today we are interested in the doctrine that he so 
steadfastly founds in and from the Scriptures, and that 
he shows a right, fine grasp and measure in reading and 
acting upon the Scriptures. 





Preface to the Epistle of St. Jacob and Jude. *) 


1 This epistle of St. Jacob, although rejected by the 
ancients, | praise, and yet consider it good, because it 
sets no man's doctrine at all, and drives God's law hard. 
But that | place my opinion on it, but without anyone's 
disadvantage, | consider it to be no apostle's writing, and 
that is my reason: 

(2) First of all, that it straightly gives righteousness to 

works, contrary to St. Paul and all other Scriptures, and 
says that Abraham was justified by his works when he 
sacrificed his son, when St. Paul teaches Rom. 4:2. (3) 
On the other hand, that Abraham was justified without 
works, only by his faith, and proves this with Genesis, 
Gen. 15:6, before he sacrificed his son. Whether this 
epistle might be helped and a gloss found on such 
righteousness of works, it cannot be protected by the 
fact that it contains Cap. 2, 23, the saying of Moses, 
Gen. 15, 6 (which speaks only of Abraham's faith and 
not of his works, as St. Paul uses it in Rom. 4, 3), yet it 
refers to the works, which is why this deficiency 
suggests that it has no apostle's righteousness. 
On the other hand, that it wants to teach Christian 
people, and does not even remember, in such long 
teaching, the suffering, the resurrection, the spirit of 
Christ. He mentions Christ several times, but he teaches 
nothing about him, but says about the common faith in 
God. For the 


The office of a true apostle is to preach about Christ's 
suffering and resurrection and ministry, and to lay the 
foundation of the same faith, as he himself says, John 
15:27: "You will bear witness of me. And in this all 
righteous holy books agree that they all preach and 
practice Christ. This is also the right test to reprove all 
books, when one sees whether they teach Christ or not, 
since all Scripture shows Christ, Rom. 3, 21, and St. 
Paul wants to know nothing but Christ, 1 Cor. 2, 2. What 
does not teach Christ is not yet apostolic, even if St. 
Peter or Paul taught it. Again, what Christ preaches 
would be apostolic if Judas, Annas, Pilate and Herod did 
it. 

4 But this Jacobus does nothing more than drift to the 
law and its works, and throws one thing into the other in 
such a disorderly way that | think it was some good, 
pious man who took some of the sayings of the apostles' 
disciples and threw them down on paper, or is perhaps 
described by someone else from his sermon. He calls 
the law a law of freedom, when St. Paul calls it a law of 
bondage, wrath, death and sin, Gal. 3, 23. 24. Rom. 7, 
11. 23. 

5 About this he cites Cap. 5, 20. the sayings of St. 
Peter, 1 Petr. 4, 8.: "Love covers the

Sins multitude"; item, Cap. [1) 5, 6.: "Humble 
yourselves under the hand of God"; item, Cap. 4, 5. 
St. Panli saying Gal. 5, 17.: "The spirit lusts against 
hatred", although St. Jacob was killed by the Herod 
in Jerusalem before St. Peter, so that it seems that 
he was long after St. Peter and Paul. 

6 He wanted to hurt those who relied on faith 
without works, and was too weak in the matter; he 
wants to do it with the law that the apostles do with 
charms for love. Therefore | cannot put it under the 
right ledgers, but | will not prevent anyone from 
putting it and lifting it up as he pleases, because there 
are many good sayings in it. 2) 


1) Inserted by us to prevent misunderstandings. In Walch and the 
Erlanger: Cap. 5, 16; in the Weimar Bible: Cap. 4, 16. 4, 16. Only in our 
Altenburg Bible correctly: Cap. 5, 6. 

2) In the edition of 1522, this decision reads thus: Summa, he wanted to 
defend those who relied on faith, without works, and is the matter with spirit, 





(7) But no one can deny that the epistle of St. Jude 
is an excerpt or copy of St. Peter's other epistle, since 
all the words are almost the same. He also speaks of 
the apostles as a disciple long after. He also tells 
sayings and stories that are nowhere to be found in 
Scripture. This also moved the old fathers to throw 
this epistle out of the main scripture. In addition, the 
apostle Jude did not come into the Greek language, 
but into Persian, as it is said that he did not write 
Greek. Therefore, although | praise it, it is an 
unnecessary epistle to include among the main 
books that are to lay the foundation of faith. 


He has been too weak in mind and words, and tears up the Scriptures, and 
with them resists Paul and all Scripture, and wants to do it by means of 
proselytizing, which the apostles do by means of appeals to love. Therefore 
I will not have it in my Bible in the number of the right ledgers; but I will 
not hinder any man with it, that he may set it and lift it up as he pleaseth; for 
many other sayings are in it. A man is not a man in worldly matters; how 
then should this single one alone apply against Paul and all other Scripture? 





53 Preface to the Revelation of St. John. *) 


1545. 


(1) Various prophecies are found in Christendom. 
Some prophesy by interpreting the Scriptures of the 
prophets, as Paul says in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14 
and other places. This is the most necessary, and 
must be had daily, as it teaches the Word of God, 
lays the foundation of Christianity, and defends the 
faith, and summa, governs, sustains, orders, and 
directs the ministry of preaching. 

2. some prophesy of things to come, which are not 
written before; and these are threefold: the first 
prophesies with expressed words, without image and 
figures, as Moses, David, and the like prophets 
prophesy of Christ, and as Christ and the apostles 
prophesy of the end-Christ and false teachers 2c. 
The other one does it with pictures, but besides that, 
the interpretation also sets in with 





expressed words, as Joseph interprets the dreams, 
and Daniel interprets both dreams and images. 

4. the third, which does it without words or 
interpretation, with mere pictures and figures, like this 
book of Revelation, and many holy people's dreams, 
visions and pictures, which they have from the Holy 
Spirit, like Apost. 2, 17. 2, 17. Peter preaches from 
Joel: "Your sons and daughters shall prophesy, and 
your young men shall see visions, and your elders 
shall dream dreams." And as long as such prophecy 
remains uninterpreted, and does not receive a 
certain interpretation, it is a hidden, silent prophecy, 
and has not yet come to its use and fruit, which it is 
to give to Christianity. 

5) As has been the case with this book so far. 
Many people have probably been 





*) This preface is found in the Leipzig edition, vol. XII, p. 70 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 63, p. 158. 


132 Erl. 63, 159-161. prefaces to the German Bible translation. W. xiv, 152-154. 1ZZ 


But up to the present day, they have not come up with 
anything certain, and some have brewed up a lot of 
clumsy things from their heads. For the sake of such 
uncertain interpretation and hidden understanding, we 
have also left it up to now, especially because it was also 
considered by some old fathers that it was not St. John 


the Apostle, as is written in libro 3. hist. eccl. cap. 25, 
in which doubt we leave it for us, so that no one should 
be prevented from taking it for St. John the Apostle, or 
as he wishes. 

6. But because we would still like to have the 
interpretation or interpretation certain, we want to give 
the other and higher spirits causes to think about, and 
also give our thoughts to day, namely thus: Since it is to 
be a revelation of future history, and especially of future 
tribulations and accidents of Christianity, we consider 
that the next and most certain way to find the 
interpretation should be to take the past history and 
accidents that have occurred in Christianity so far from 
the histories, and hold them against these pictures, and 
thus compare them to the words. If then it would rhyme 
and coincide with each other, then one could rely on it 
as a certain or at least as an unobjectionable 
interpretation. 

(7) Accordingly, as the text itself says, the first three 
chapters, which speak of the seven commoners and 
their angels in Asia, intend nothing else than to show 
plainly how they were at that time, and to exhort them to 
remain and increase, or to improve. We learn about this 
from the word "angels" in other images or stories, and 
understand bishops and teachers in Christendom, some 
good, as the holy fathers and bishops, some bad, as the 
heretics and false bishops, who are more in this book 
than the latter. 

In the fourth and fifth chapters, the whole of Christendom 
is presented, which is to suffer such future tribulations 
and plagues. There are twenty-four elders crowned with 
faith before God (that is, all the bishops and teachers 
united), who have received Christ, the Lamb, the Lord 
and the Holy Spirit. 


1) In the original: "Geschichten", in Walch: "Gesichten", which is 
perhaps the right thing to say. 





To praise God with the harps, that is, to preach, and to 
serve with the touch, that is, to practice praying. All this 
is for the comfort of Christians, so that they may know 
that Christianity will still remain in the plagues to come. 

In the sixth there are the future tribulations, and first 
of all the bodily tribulations, which are the persecution of 
the worldly authorities, which is the crowned horseman 
with the bow on the white horse. Item, war and blood, 
which is the rider with the sword on the red horse. Item, 
theure Zeit und Hunger, which is the rider with the scales 
2) on the black horse. Item, pestilence and gland, which 
is the rider in the image of death on the pale horse. For 
these four plagues will certainly always follow the 
ungrateful and despisers of the word of God, among 
others, disturbance and change of the authorities, until 
the last day, as is shown at the end of the sixth chapter, 
v. 13, and the souls of the martyrs also do this with their 
cries. 

The seventh and eighth chapters contain the 
revelation of spiritual tribulations, which are various 
heresies. And before that, a consolation picture is 
presented, where the angel draws the Christians and 
fends off the four evil angels, so that one can be sure 
that Christianity will have pious angels and the pure word 
even among the heretics. As also the angel with the 
censer, that is, with the prayer, shows. Such good angels 
are the holy fathers, as Spiridon, Athanasius, Hilarius, 
and the Concilium Nicenum, and the like. 

The first evil angel is TaUanus with his Encratites, 
who forbade marriage, item, wanted to be pious by 
works, like the Jews. For the doctrine of works holiness 
had to be the first against the gospel, and probably 
remains the last; without it always getting new teachers 
and other names, as Pelagians 2c. 

The other is Marcion with his cataphrygians, 
Manichaeans, Montanis 2c., who boast of their 
spirituality above all scripture, and drive like this burning 
mountain between heaven and earth, as with us the 
coiner and the enthusiasts. 


2) In any case incorrect in the original edition: with the bow.

The third is Origen, who, through philosophia and 
reason, has embittered and corrupted the Scriptures, 
as the high schools have done in our country. 

The fourth is Novatus with his Cathars, who 
refused to repent and wanted to be the purest before 
others. The Donatists were also of this kind 
afterwards. Our clergy, however, are almost all four 
kinds. The scholars, who know the histories, will 
know how to calculate this; for it would be too long to 
tell and prove everything. 

(15) In the ninth [and] tenth the real sorrow arises, 
because up to now the bodily and spiritual afflictions 
have been almost a joke compared to these future 
plagues. As the angel himself indicates at the end of 
the eighth chapter, v. 13, three woes are to come; 
which woes are to be inflicted by the other three, that 
is, the fifth, the fiercest, the seventh angel, and thus 
an end to the world. Here both spiritual and bodily 
persecution come together; there shall be three of 
them. The first great, the other still greater, the third 
greatest of all. 

16 The first woe, the fifth angel, is Arius, the great 
heretic, and his companions, who _ plagued 
Christianity so horribly throughout the world, that the 
text here says: the pious people would rather have 
died than have seen such things; and yet they had to 
see such things and not die. Yes, he says that the 
angel from hell, called the destroyer, is their king; as 
if they wanted to say that the devil himself was riding 
them. For they have persecuted the true Christians 
not only spiritually, but also bodily with their sword. 
Read the story of the Arians, and you will understand 
these figures and words. 

17 The other woe is the sixth angel, the shameful 
Mahomet with his companions, the Saracens, who 
have created a great plague on Christendom with 
their teachings and sword. Alongside and with the 
same angel, so that this plague may be all the 
greater, comes the strong angel with the rainbow and 
the bitter book, that is, the holy papacy with its great 
spiritual glow, the masses, and seize the temple with 
their laws, push out the choir, and set up a larval 
church or outward holiness. 


(18) In the eleventh [and] twelfth, two comforting 
images are placed between such evil travails and 
plagues: one of the two preachers, and one of the 
pregnant woman who gives birth to a baby without the 
dragon's thanks. So that it is indicated that 
nevertheless some pious teachers and Christians 
shall remain, both under the two previous woes and 
the third future woe. And now the last two woes run 
with each other, and at the same time attack 
Christianity to the last, and the devil thereby finally 
pushes the bottom out of the barrel. 

So now in the thirteenth chapter comes the third 
woe: Chapter (on the trumpet of the last of the seven 
angels, who blows in the beginning of the twelfth 
chapter) of the same seventh angel's business, the 
third woe, namely the papal emperorship and imperial 
papacy. Here the papacy also gets the secular sword 
into its power, and now rules not only with the book in 
the other woe, but also with the sword in the third 
woe. How then they boast that the pope has both [the] 
spiritual and temporal sword in his power. 

(20) Now here are the two beasts: one is the 
empire, the other, with the two horns, the papacy, 
which has now also become a temporal empire, but 
with the appearance of the name of Christ. For the 
pope has restored the fallen Roman Empire and 
brought it from the Greeks to the Germans; and yet it 
is more an image of the Roman Empire than of the 
body of the empire itself, as it was; yet he gives spirit 
and life to such an image that it nevertheless has its 
estates, rights, members and offices, and goes on to 
some extent in the swing. This is the image that has 
been sore and has been healed. 

But what abominations, woes and damages such 
an imperial papacy has done is not to be told now. 
For first, through his book the world has become full 
of all idolatry, with monasteries, foundations, saints, 
pilgrimages, purgatory, indulgences, immorality, and 
countless more pieces of human doctrine and works 
2c. On the other hand, who can tell how much blood, 
murder, war and misery the popes have caused, both 
with wars themselves, and with charms the emperors, 
kings, princes among themselves? 

22. here now goes and runs the devil's last wrath 
with each other in the swing: there 


136 Erl. 63, 164-168. prefaces to the German Bible translation. W. xiv, 157-159. 


Towards the morning the other woe, Mahomet and 
the Saracens; here towards the evening, the papacy 
and empire with the third woe; to which, as an encore, 
the Turk, Gog and Magog also come, as will follow in 
the twentieth chapter, and thus Christendom in all the 
world and on all sides is plagued with false doctrines 
and wars, with book and sword in the most dreadful 
and miserable way. This is the basic soup and the 
final plague. This is now followed by almost vain 
consolations of the end of such all woes and 
abominations. 

In the fourteenth chapter, Christ first sends the 
spirit of his mouth to kill (as St. Paul says in 2 Thess. 
2, 8) his final Christ, and the angel comes with the 
gospel against the bitter book of the strong angel. 
And now again saints, also virgins, stand around the 
Lamb and preach rightly. What gospel is followed by 
the voice of another angel, that the city of Babylon 
shall fall, and the spiritual papacy perish. 

It follows that the harvest will be kept, and those 
who persist in the gospel apart from the city of Christ 
will be thrown into the winepress of divine wrath. That 
is, through the gospel they are condemned to the 
wrath of God as separated from Christianity. Which is 
much, and the winepress yields much blood. Or 
perhaps there may still be a righteous punishment 
and judgment on our sins, which are out of measure 
and overripe. 

(25) Then in the fifteenth and sixteenth chapters 
come the seven angels with the seven bowls; and the 
gospel is increased, and the priesthood is overthrown 
in all places by many learned and pious preachers, 
and the throne of the beast, the priest's power, is 
darkened, wicked, and despised. But they all become 
angry, and confidently defend themselves. For three 
frogs, three unclean spirits, come out of the mouth of 
the beast and provoke the kings and princes against 
the gospel. But it does not help; their quarrel happens 
at Armageddon. The frogs are the sophists, as Faber, 
Eck, Emser, 2c., who offer many things against the 
gospel, and yet accomplish nothing, and remain 
frogs. 

In the seventeenth century, the imperial papacy and 
the papal emperorship are captured in one image 
from beginning to end, 





137 


and immediately presented in a summa, how it is 
nothing (because the old Roman Empire is long 
gone), and yet is (because there are several 
countries, and in addition the city of Rome also still 
there). Such a picture is presented here, just as an 
evildoer is publicly put on trial to be condemned, so 
that one may know how this animal will soon be 
condemned, and as St. Paul says in 2 Thess. 2, 8, 
will be destroyed by the appearance of the future of 
our Lord. Which, as he says in the text, also the 
patrons of the papacy saw, who now protect it so that 
the clergy will sit almost naked. 

In the eighteenth now such disturbance starts, and 
the glorious great splendor goes to the ground, and 
the robbers and thieves of foundations, the Cortisans, 
listen. 1) For Rome also had to be plundered and 
stormed by her own patron, for the beginning of the 
final disturbance. 

28 They still do not let up, seek, comfort, prepare 
and resist; and, as he says here in the nineteenth 
chapter, now that they can no longer handle the 
Scriptures and books, and have attacked the frogs, 
they take hold of them in earnest, and want to carry it 
out by force; they gather kings and princes to the 
battle. But they run. For he on the white horse, who 
is called the word of God, wins, until both animal and 
prophet are seized and thrown into hell. 

21). While all this is going on, in the twentieth 
chapter the last potion, Gog and Magog, the Turk, the 
red Jews, whom Satan, who was imprisoned a 
thousand years ago and was released after a 
thousand years, brings. But they shall also soon enter 
the lake of fire with him. For we consider that this 
image, as a special one from the previous ones, was 
made for the sake of the Turks, and the thousand 
years are to be counted at the time when this book 
was written, and at the same time the devil was also 
bound. But the calculation must not be so exact every 
minute. The last judgment follows the Turks at the 
end of this chapter, as Dan. 7, 7. 8. also shows. 

30. last on the twenty-first will be the 


1) "Cortisans" (Curtisans) - courtiers.

The final consolation is that the holy city will be fully 
prepared and led as a bride to the eternal wedding, 
that Christ alone will be the Lord, and all the wicked 
will be damned and go to hell with the devil. 

(31) According to this interpretation, we can use 
this book and make good use of it. First of all, for our 
consolation, that we know that no power nor lies, no 
wisdom nor holiness, no tribulation nor suffering will 
oppress Christianity, but it will finally retain and 
prevail. 

32 Secondly, as a warning against the great, 
dangerous, and manifold troubles that are coming 
upon Christendom. For since such mighty power and 
appearances should fight against Christianity, and it 
should be hidden under so many tribulations, 
heresies and other afflictions, it is impossible for 
reason and nature to recognize Christianity, but it 
falls away and is annoyed by it, which is called the 
Christian church, which are the worst enemies of the 
Christian church, and again it is called damned 
heretics, which are the true Christian church; as has 
hitherto been done under the Pabbacy, Mahomet, 
indeed with all heretics, and thus lose this article: "I 
believe a holy Christian church." 

(33) Just as some clever people do now, because 
they see heresy, discord, and various shortcomings, 
that there are many false, many loose Christians, 
they quickly and freely judge that there are no 
Christians. For they have heard that Christians are 
supposed to be a holy, peaceful, united, friendly, 
virtuous people; consequently they think that there 
should be no trouble, no heresy, no lack, but only 
peace and virtue. 

These should read this book and learn to look at 
Christianity with different eyes than with reason. For 
this book (Il mean) shows enough horrible monstrous 
beasts, hideous, hostile angels, desolate and terrible 
plagues. | want to tell you about the other great 


1) "formed" - represented in the picture. 





We see here clearly what cruel troubles and 
shortcomings have existed before our times, since it 
is thought that Christianity has been in the best of 
times, that our time has been a golden year. We can 
clearly see here what cruel annoyances and 
shortcomings existed before our times, since one 
thinks that Christianity was at its best, that our time 
would be a golden year compared to those. Do you 
not think that the pagans also took offense at this, and 
considered the Christians to be mischievous, loose, 
quarrelsome people? 

35 This piece, "Il believe in a holy Christian 
church," is as much an article of faith as the others. 
Therefore no reason, even if it puts on all the glasses, 
can recognize it. The devil can cover it up with 
aversions and mobs, so that you have to be annoyed 
by them. God can also hide her with infirmities and all 
kinds of shortcomings, so that you have to become a 
fool about it and make a wrong judgment about her. 
It is not to be seen, but to be believed; but faith is of 
that which is not seen, Heb. 11:1. 

(36) And she also sings with her Lord the song, 
Blessed is he that is not offended in me. A Christian 
is also hidden from himself, that he does not see his 
holiness and virtue, but sees in himself all unholiness 
and unholiness. And you, coarse kligling, wanted to 
see Christianity with your blind reason and unclean 
eyes?' 

Our holiness is in heaven, where Christ is, and not 
in the world, before our eyes, like a thing in the 
marketplace. Therefore, let the troubles, the mobs, 
the heresies, and the infirmities be and do what they 
may; if only the word of the gospel remains pure with 
us, and we love and value it, then we should not doubt 
that Christ is with us and with us, even if it goes to the 
worst, aS we see here in this book, that Christ is 
nevertheless with and with his saints through and 
above all plagues, beasts, and evil angels, and is 
finally subject to them.

54 Preface to the Revelation of St. John, 1522, 


which Luther suppressed in the late 


In this book of the Revelation of John, | also let 
everyone have his own way; | do not want to bind 
anyone to my conceit or judgment. | say what | feel. 
| do not lack anything in this book, that | consider it 
neither apostolic nor prophetic. First and foremost, 
that the apostles do not deal with visions, but 
prophesy with clear and concise words, as Peter, 
Paul, and Christ also do in the Gospel; for it is also 
proper to the apostolic office to speak clearly and 
without image or face about Christ and his deeds. 
There is no prophet in the Old Testament, let alone 
in the New, who speaks so thoroughly with visions 
and images that | consider it almost equal to the 
fourth vision of Ezra and cannot feel that it is full of 
the Holy Spirit. In addition, it seems to me to be too 
much that he so harshly commands such his own 
book, more than any other holy books do, since much 
more is needed, and 


r editions of the New Testament.*) 


again, blessed are those who keep what is written 
therein, since no one knows what it is, let alone that 
he should keep it, and it is just as much as if we did 
not have it, even though there are many more noble 
books to keep. Many of the fathers have rejected this 
book before, and even though St. Jerome speaks it 
with high words and says that it is above all praise, 
and that there is as much mystery in it as words, he 
cannot prove anything about it and is too lenient in all 
places of his praise. Finally, everyone thinks of it 
what his spirit gives him. My spirit cannot be sent into 
the light, and it is reason enough for me that | do not 
esteem it highly, that Christ is neither taught nor 
recognized in it, which, above all things, an apostle is 
obliged to do, as he says in Acts 1:8. 1:8: "Ye shall 
be my witnesses." That is why | stay with the books 
that present Christ to me brightly and purely.

by Others 


1. preface about the D. Urban Rhegius explanation of the prophecies of the Old 
Testament of Christ.*) 
1542. 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


For many reasons, | am very concerned when | 
hear of the deaths of pious people, especially those 
who distinguished themselves by their efficiency in 
the administration of both the community and the 
household. For first of all, | regret the loss that the 
church, the community, or I, the families suffer who 
have been deprived of their faithful guardians. 

To speak of the churches now: what a great 
damage the Saxon churches have suffered by the 
loss of Urban Rhegius, who in truth was a right 
bishop of the neighboring countries, in which he 
spread the gospel of Christ purely and loudly, 
improved the worship and the life of the people, 
suppressed the nonsensical nature of the 
enthusiasts, ruled many godly ministers of the Word 
and others who are in negation by his teaching, 
counsel and reputation. A large part of these people 
now realize that they are going astray like a flock 
without a shepherd. 

But in thinking of the loss of such men, there comes 
another far greater one 


lam also in greater and more intense pain. For when 
| look in my mind at the churches of all countries 
around, which | also include in my prayers, | think, 
not without great sorrow, of how few capable 
preachers there are, even in those who are 
considered the most excellent, how great weakness, 
even perversity, there is in some. | also lament the 
people's disaffection with the Gospel, who do not 
care for religion, do not strive to maintain the 
preaching ministry, do not fear God's terrible wrath, 
and do not improve their lives. Furthermore, when | 
look at the schools in which the seedlings are to be 
raised, through which the church and the community 
are to be governed in the descendants, how much it 
grieves me when | see the carelessness, the 
ignorance and the presumptuous nature of the young 
people who will be our successors. Finally, when | 
turn my attention to the princes and their courts, | am 
truly filled with a displeasure that is coupled with pain. 
For since this highest estate is, above all, the 
churches 





*Before Rhegius (Regius) turned to the Gospel, he worked in Ingolstadt as a teacher of poetry and oratory. Later he was a zealous promoter of the 


cause of the Gospel and became General Superintendent at Liineburg. In 1532 he collected and explained for his wife all the Old Testament prophecies of 
Christ, and at the request of many friends published them in 1537 under the title: "Dialogus oder Gesprach von der herrlich krafftigen Predigt, welche der 
Heyland aus Mose und den Propheten den zweyen nach Emaus reisenden Jiingern in Eréffnung der heiligen Schriften gehalten. Later, at the request of 
Rhegius, Johann Freder translated this writing into Latin and dedicated it to his sovereigns, the Dukes of Brunswick and Liineburg, from Hamburg in the 
month of April 1542. As can be seen from the preface, Luther wrote it only after the death of Rhegius (but probably already in 1541) for the Latin edition, 
which has the title: Prophetiae veteris Testamenti de Christo collectae et explicatae per D. Urbanum Regium cum praef. D. Martini 


Lutheri etc. 1542. The same is subsequently included in "Opera Urbani Regii latine edita, Norimbergae 1562", tom. I, p. 165. In Latin, the 
preface is also found in the Lupplerueuto Lpi8tolaruru IVlart. ttutkerl euur praek. Luddei, p. 331 and in the Erlanger, Opera varii arAuioeuti, tona. VII, p. 
558. 1VI Greifs prepared a German translation for the Leipzig edition, vol. XII, p. 74, which Walch has reprinted. We have retranslated according to the 
Erlangen edition.

If the ruler should cultivate and nurture, exercise 
discipline, encourage diligent study of the sciences and 
virtuous living, adorn the gospel with good examples, 
show godliness in domestic life, diligence in the 
administration of justice, zeal in serious punishment, 
bravery and valor in protecting the citizens and the 
confederates, what of these things does he do? If the 
princes carefully directed their office, they would in turn 
be adorned by God with great honor, as it is written [1 
Sam. 2, 30/: "Whoever honors me, | will honor him also." 
How great an adornment it would be if God awakened 
them to protect the homeland against the ravages of the 
Turk, 1) and "taught their hand to fight," as the Psalm 
[Ps. 18, 35] speaks. But, to come back to the pointu: | 
deceive myself greatly when | look at the vices of the 
individual estates. And when outstanding members of 
Christ are called away from this life, | am also moved by 
what is indicated by this. 2) For when common 
punishments are imminent, God first takes away from 
the rest of the multitude the elect, as Isaiah [Cap. 57, 
1.2/ says: "The righteous are taken away from calamity, 
and those who have walked rightly before them come to 
peace, and rest in their chambers." Thus, before the 
flood of sin, the godly fathers and their hearers gently fell 
asleep, so that they would not have to witness the wrath 
of God so great, by which the whole human race was 
destroyed, except for the One Family of Noah; and 
before the destruction of Jerusalem, the saints were torn 
out from there. Thus God, as John says [Matth. 3, 12.], 
first gathers the wheat into His barn, but after that He 
throws the chaff into the eternal fire. But at this time the 
deaths of godly people are frequent, and the bad crowd 
remains, which despises God, which is secure, which 
competes with each other in ambition and greed, which 
is devoted to indulgence, which is easy-going, and which 
has no desire to be a part of the world. 


1) This passage shows that Luther wrote this preface around the 
time that he had his "Exhortation to Prayer Against the Turks" 
published, in which the same complaints are made that Luther has 
voiced in the preceding. Cf. St. Louis edition, vol. XX, 2194 ff. 

2) The words: etiam significatione moveor have been given 
by the old translator as: "so gehet mir auch nur die Nachricht davon 
sehr nahe". 





ready, mischievous, well-versed in new and unusual 
deceptions, lying, faithless. Precisely by these signs | am 
moved exceedingly strongly to believe that great 
misfortunes and changes in the conditions of people are 
imminent, which will chasten the insolence of men and 
again put a rein on the unruly world. 

Although it is therefore to be regretted that the church 
is deprived of its protective walls by the death of the 
teachers and the godly, they are to be wished happiness 
in this, one might say, emigration. The Scripture says 
[Revelation 14:13], "Blessed are the dead which die in 
the Lord." Therefore, we are to know that our Urban, who 
has lived continually in right invocation of God and in faith 
in Christ, and has served the church faithfully, and has 
adorned the gospel by a chaste and godly life, is blessed, 
and has eternal life and joy in the fellowship of Christ and 
the heavenly church, in which he now learns, sees, and 
hears as present what he has preached here in the 
church according to God's word. As he previously 
conversed with his wife, with his children, and even with 
all his readers about the sayings of the fathers and the 
prophets, which he cites in this "conversation" in a godly, 
learned and appropriate manner, so he now hears the 
first teachers themselves, and Christ, who interprets 
them, and rejoices that his faith overcomes the voice of 
Christ and the Fathers, and thanks God for the light that 
was given to him before he departed, through which sin 
was blotted out in him and eternal life began. And | 
believe that it was not by chance that he read this talk 
about the resurrection very often shortly before his death, 
as if he had foreseen in his mind his departure from here. 
Since he saw the glorious resurrection of Christ in it, he 
knew that death had passed and inculcated this word of 
Christ in himself, since he says [Hos. 13, 14/: "Death, | 
will be a poison to you; hell, | will be a pestilence to you." 

But as Urban's behavior towards his wife and children 
was exceptionally godly, and his wife is distinguished by 
all the virtues of a godly man, his wife is a godly man.

If the priest had been guided to all honors by his wife's 
room and his family, it is to be believed that he did not 
part from his own who needed his service without 
sadness, but nevertheless he knew that God was the 
father of the orphans and the protector of the widows. 
Now he commands his family to God, who has 
certainly protected the families of godly priests until 
now, and will continue to protect and nourish them, 
even against the will of the world, as it is written [Ps. 
37:25]: "| have never seen the righteous forsaken, or 
his seed going after bread." | also hope that it will 
happen that through the war service of these godly 
women, daughters and sons, that is, through 
godliness and prayer, our churches and communities 
will be protected against the cruelty of the Turk. 

So much for our Urban, whose memory we must 
preserve, so that we may read his writings all the 
more eagerly, for they contain godly and salutary 
teachings. When we commemorate his death, we 
should wish him happiness in his exceedingly loving 
relationship with Christ, but take the orphanhood of 
the churches to heart, and ask God to send similar 
ministers of the Word into the harvest of the Gospel. 
We should also pray that He will alleviate the 
misfortune threatening the whole world and that we 
will improve our lives. 

In particular, however, | command the students 
this "Conversation," which contains an exceedingly 
useful consolation for the godly, and has brought 
together many testimonies in One Little Covenant, 
and interprets them in an erudite manner. The world, 
too, must confess against its will that this teaching of 
the promises of the Gospel, which is presented in the 
Proverbs of the Fathers, has not had as much light in 
many centuries as it now has by God's grace. 
Therefore, these writings must be preserved. But the 
security of the people in the greatest vices is so great 
that it is to be feared that the thickest darkness will 
follow again and the punishments of it, multiple 
misfortunes, changes and disturbances of the 
kingdoms. It is also an honorable and praiseworthy; 
example that he, together with his godly wife, has 
been able to overcome the 





Proverbs of the Fathers and Prophets. For this 
conjugal communion is the beginning and the planting 
place of the church; therefore, it is fitting that married 
couples should discuss no matter more than God and 
His good deeds and admirable works, the examples 
of which godly married couples see daily in the 
witnessing and raising of their children. Then there is 
nothing more lovely than when husband and wife are 
of the same mind in faith and call upon God with one 
accord. It is a great help to each other when the faith 
of one is concerned for the other and makes an effort 
for him before God. Yes, marriage should be such a 
community of which Christ says [Matth. 18, 20.]: 
"Where two are gathered together in my name, there 
am | in the midst of them." Husbands and wives 
should call upon God together in right faith, talk to 
each other about the Gospel, teach their children the 
Gospel. In the walk and dangers of such spouses, 
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is undoubtedly present, 
destroying the works of the devil, who, just as he 
seeks to destroy the whole Church, also attacks godly 
spouses and godly families in the most furious way. 
But under these dangers the faith of the saints shines 
and Christ triumphs. The impure papists and 
defenders of the defiled celibate state ridicule such 
conversations of godly spouses, but there is no doubt 
that the papists will suffer the punishments of their 
immorality, by which they defile the whole order of 
nature and offend God in a terrible way. O, how hard 
and iron are the hearts of men! The sins of Pabstism, 
their idolatry and most shameful lusts are obvious, 
and the punishment, namely the raging of the Turk, is 
before our eyes, and yet such atrocious deeds of 
shame are still praised and defended. Therefore, let 
us pray to God that the exceedingly joyful day may 
soon dawn for the Church, when Christ will publicly 
show Himself to the world and, after raising the dead, 
will destroy the devil and the wicked. He will, after 
raising the dead and casting out the devil and the 
ungodly into eternal torment, make glorious the 
multitude who have been obedient to the Gospel in 
this life under great tribulations.

2. Preface on the D, Wenceslaus Link Annotationes on the 


five books of Moses. *) 
1543. 


Genesis prophesies of his book, and says Deut. 
32, 2. f.:"Let my teaching drip like the rain, and let my 
speech flow like water, like the rain on the grass, and 
like the drops on the herb. For | will praise the name 
of the LORD." This prophecy has been fulfilled and 
will be fulfilled until the end of the world. For as all the 
Greek poets’ art flowed from "Homer" as a fountain, 
so also from it flowed all the prophets' books, yes, 
also the whole New Testament, which is promised in 
it; and all that is well and divinely taught and is taught 
in the people of God or churches, is all from Moses 
originally, from the cause, for he does not preach 
fables nor men's wisdom, but, as he himself boasts 
here, "the name of the Lord | will praise", that is, of 
God and his works he will 1) preach. This is the only 
wisdom, against which all the wisdom of the world is 
nothing. For no heathen speak and teach of God as 
Moses did; nor do the heathen know, nor can they 
know, that God is the Creator of heaven and earth, 
where death and sin come from, what will come after 
this life; and that Messiah must be the seed of a 
woman, who is to bless the world and redeem it from 
death and sin. Sirach also praises Moses, Sir. 24, 32. 
ff.: "All this is the book of the covenant, made with the 
most high God, namely, the law, which Moses 
commanded the house of Jacob for a treasure, from 
which wisdom flowed, like the waters of Pison when 
it is great, and like the waters of Tigris when it 
overflows.

2) From it the mind has flowed, like the Euphrates 
when it is great, and like the Jordan in harvest. From 
the same the breeding has broken out, like the light, 
and like the water Nilus in the summer. He has never 
been, who would have it ausgelernet, and will never 
be, who would have it ausgelernet. For his mind is 
richer than any sea, and his word deeper than any 
abyss." 

This is also truly true. For |, as a lesser Christian, 
have also tried it a little, and when | have brought it 
up, | have become aware that | have hardly been an 
alphabetist in it. Although the great teacher St. 
Augustine also confesses, 3) that he first learned and 
increased in writing and teaching, and is a far 
different man in the last books than in the first.

eat before it is half ripe. Just as we have seen many 
books these thirty years, none of which are 
remembered or present anymore; but there have 
never been too many good books, not yet. So also 
we have a certain command from the Lord that we 
should search the Scriptures. And St. Paul 
commands Timothy to stop reading [1 Tim. 4:13]. 
Now such research and reading cannot be done, one 
must be there with the pen and write down what is 
especially given to him under reading and study, so 
that he can remember and retain it. 

4 And in this way, no doubt, they studied the 
prophets in Moses, and the last prophets in the first, 
and wrote out their good thoughts in a book, inspired 
by the Holy Spirit. For they were not such people as 
the spirits and the mobs, who put Moses under the 
bench, and made up their own faces, and preached 
dreams, but practiced in Moses daily and diligently; 
as he also commands very often and hard to read his 
book, also to the king, Deut. 17, 19. and Joshua 1, 8. 

(5) But whether the same good and faithful 
teachers and searchers of the Scriptures sometimes 
built with hay, straw, wood, and not with silver, gold, 
and precious stones, yet the foundation remains 
there; the other consumeth the fener of the day, as 
St. Paul saith 1 Cor. 3:12, 13, and Moses [Deut. 26:") 
10], "Ye shall eat of the fener, and when the new 
cometh, ye shall put away the fener." For so we do 


also with some writings, as M[agistri] Sententiarum, 
Augustini, Gregorii, Cypriani, and almost all 
teachers. Therefore it is right and well done, whoever 
is given the grace, to take care of the Scriptures with 
right earnestness, to research and search, and what 
good things God gives him, to communicate to others 
also through books, and thus to help interpret the 
Scriptures, and to improve the churches, according 
to the rule 1 Cor. 14, 4. 6. 2) For everything should 
be done for the better. 


1) In the Wittenberg and in the Jena erroneously: "Deut. 26." 
2) Here the Erlanger from Walch has printed: 1 Cor. 14, 46. 





The church is to be established for the glory of God, 
so that we may praise the name of the Lord with 
Moses. 

Since in these annotations my dear lord and 
friend, Doctor Wenceslaus Link, has also taken care 
of Moses, and | know well his gift, which is given to 
him, that he means it seriously and diligently, it is well 
done that his faithful work be communicated to 
others through printing; for he has now been well 
practiced for many years in the pure Christian, 
apostolic doctrine. Would God that they all did so, or 
that those who did not have the grace to leave their 
untimely, useless writing, so that the Church would 
be weighed down, would stand. If 3) Carolstadt, 
Zwingel, and their like had refrained from writing, the 
church would have remained purer, and it would 
have fared better in the end. 

Finally, we shall and will do our part in our time, 
and help to promote the Word of God, according to 
St. Paul's command, that it may dwell abundantly in 
the church, so that no one may have to excuse 
himself at the last judgment that it has not been 
revealed to him, or that it has been revealed too 
scantily and little, but must confess that it has been 
presented to him, not by one book, but by many 
books, not by one doctor, but by many doctors, 
without ceasing, with all fidelity, rightly and well. 
Hereby we are excused and have washed our hand. 
For we should not have it better, neither the apostles 
had it, that they complain of itching ears after new 
doctrine, and weariness of wholesome doctrine [2 
Tim. 4, 3. f.]. Or perhaps this is the last time of which 
they speak; yes, | think it is not perhaps, but certainly 
the same time. For the more abundantly one 
preaches and teaches, the more weary and casual 
the people become; they will answer for themselves; 


we are to [persevere] continually, 4) importune, 
opportune, our labor is not in vain, of this we are 


sure. To God be praise and glory for such his rich gift 
of his word, from now until eternity, Amen.

3, preface about Justus Menius explanation of the first book Samuelis, *) 


1533. 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


Although this booklet deserved to go out to the public 
without my preface, since it is recommended quite 
respectably, both by the name of its author and by the 
value of the work and the content, | had to oblige the 
printers, and add this little ephemera to the wine, which 
in itself is already sufficiently marketable, since they are 
either deceived or persuaded that through the testimony 
of my name, foreign books, which | have approved, attain 
greater favor or appreciation. 

But | hope, yes, | know it for sure, that godly readers 
will find in this booklet a not insignificant knowledge and 
comfort of the spiritual teaching, which has to do with 
your faith. Indeed, in an unfortunate (not to say 
pernicious) way, some ancient fathers have also treated 
the (so-called) histories of the Old Testament. For they 
left aside the faith that is active through love, which is the 
main and the summa in the sacred histories (by this one 
virtue they differ from the worldly histories of the pagans 
like heaven from earth, light from darkness, life from 
death), and imposed on us their cold and unrhymed 
secret interpretations, which were nothing else than new 
histories of the actions of believers and heretics, which 
were presented to us under the name of the old histories. 
Thus it happened that the sacred histories were made 
completely useless to us and, as it were, dead, which 
were only valid in their time, and were only used by us in 
the church out of curiosity or for the purpose of 


1) Instead of differt, either differunt should be read, or 
historia sacra should be added. 





pleasure (if someone wanted to) should be read. Yes, 
even the secret interpretations of them seem to us, since 
they are ecclesiastical histories that already belong to 
the past, to be outdated and dead; they have no more 
use for teaching or admonishing. This would certainly 
completely obscure the histories, the knowledge of 
which must always be very useful and pleasant, 
especially those of sacred things and which have taken 
place among God's people, and completely take away 
both the benefit and the fruit of them. 

This is not how my Menius has done it in this booklet, but 
has traced everything back to the source and the main 
piece, and teaches that the faith of the saints against 
God must be uppermost in the histories. By this means 
he has accomplished what is praiseworthy in orators and 
teachers, namely, that he makes new what is old, gives 
light to dark things, brings to grace what is despised, and 
skillfully combines what is useful with what is pleasant. 
For if you compare this interpretation with the old ones, 
you will see that even the histories, by applying faith to 
them, are reborn and made new, as it were by a kind of 
baptism, and live for us also in our time, yes, forever, and 
serve in a useful way, by the glorious and exceedingly 
clear examples of faith, for chastening, for punishment, 
for instruction, and for comfort, yes, also for everything 
of which Paul writes that the word of faith is useful for. 
For what is sacred history but a visible word of faith, or a 
work of faith, which teaches us by deed and work the 
same things that Scripture elsewhere holds forth by word 
and speech? Now if you neglect to look into the

If we are to act on faith in the sacred histories, which 
Origen has set in motion, the histories of the pagans 
will be far greater and more glorious, so that a mind 
that is without faith and is guided by natural reason 
must necessarily detest and despise the sacred 
histories as minor trifles compared to the 
tremendously great deeds of the world rulers.

everything, and deprive godly hearts of the fruit and

Praised be GOD and the Father of our Lord JEsu 
Christ, who has blessed us again at this time with all 
kinds of spiritual blessings in heavenly goods [Eph. 
1, 3.], and satiates us with the abundance of the 
wheat and the wine of His elect, and by His word, 
which He has sent, melts the locks, the snow and the 
hoar frost, before whose cold no one could stand 
before [Ps. 147, 14-17.]. To these people [through 
whom GOD scatters His blessing] 3) also belongs

GOD and our Father, is Bishop of the Church at 
Wittenberg

through whose ministry this Psalter is given to you, 
dearest reader, opened by the Spirit of Christ, who is 
the key of David [Is. 22, 22. Revelation 3, 7]. It is not 
worth the trouble that | highlight this Psalter with 
many words, because it will be abundantly 
recommended to you (I know that), not by my 
testimony, but by its own content, by which it will 
require you (when you read it) to testify that it is the 
Spirit who speaks these mysteries that have been 
hidden for so many centuries. For in order that a 
comparison may be made both with the 
interpretations of the ancients and with those of the 
moderns, | dare to say, although it is not easy to say 
it, that the Psalter of David has not been interpreted 
by anyone (whose books are available), and that it is 
the Spirit who speaks these mysteries that have 
been hidden for so many centuries.

Let Pommer be the first in the whole world who deserves 
to be called an interpreter of the Psalter; so even all the 
others in general, each with his own, and indeed an

wonders. It is true that | too once began to devote my 
work to this book, but the tyranny of the papists has

itself and the opportunity to clearly and obviously see, 
hear and grasp his David, Isaiah, Paul, John, and even 
himself, not merely through a man's pen or tongue, but

(1) Many strange things have happened in the 
Christian church, some comforting, some frightening, as 
the ancient histories and books testify. But in my opinion, 
if such a diligent scribe were in our time (as the Greeks 
and Romans were), and were to write out the stories that 
have occurred daily up to this point, one would certainly 
read and hear many a miracle. How then all here in this 
booklet an enormous piece of our time stories is 
described. 

(2) For through much practice (praising God) | have 
come to believe that God is the Creator of heaven and 
earth. Which text now and always’ everyone 
understands too well, and has understood, and still will 
understand, except me alone, and some poor sinners 
and fools, as Moses, 





David, Isaiah, and the like (among whom | must boast: 


Nos poma natamus, like the horse dung among the 
apples); they consider God to be a strange man, and say 
that His creation is a miraculous work, yet almost few see 
His miraculous works, although everyone sees His 
creation, and as St. Paul Apost. 17, 24. ff., everyone 
must grasp and feel it. But | am also one of the coarse 
fellows who do not yet understand such a creature of his, 
and (as | said) have hardly begun to believe such things, 
so that I, an old student, and now almost an experienced 
doctor, would like to be astonished how in our times 
people, as soon as they smell a book, know everything 
that the Holy Spirit knows. Nevertheless, they go there 
and see nothing that God does before our eyes every 
day, which is both terrible and comforting; nor do they 
turn their backs on anything that the Holy Spirit knows. 


*Moiban reformed in Breslau and was a preacher there at St. Elisabeth's Church. He died in 1554, and his interpretation was 
published under the title: "Der. xxix. The Psalm of David on the power of God's voice in the lusts of the high rulers, together with several 
terrible storms, which occurred in the recent past in Slesia, interpreted and written. By D. Ambrosium Moibanum parish priest at Breslaw.

as if it were all an illusion. Through Adam's sin, 
human nature has fallen so deeply from God and His 
image, that is, from His knowledge, that we also do 
not recognize our own body and life, how wonderfully 
the same is created, given and preserved daily by 
God. What wonder is it, then, if we are hard, stiff, 
stone-blind, 1) and lumps against other His wondrous 
works, which He shows us apart from body and life in 
all creatures? 

Summa, this life is no good. God is too despised 
and unknown; ingratitude is too great. Come on, 
death, and strangle all the bad boys. And Christ help 
us into his kingdom. Here is nothing good; the devil 
is abbot in the world, and his brothers are all at once

always performs miracles upon miracles, sign upon

such things have not been heard nor seen before,

proud hearts, as Jesus Sirach says: "perform new 
miracles, give new signs" 2c. [For it is the same God 
who does miracles now, who did miracles before, and

what we see and hear now. And our descendants 
(when the history of our time would come to them 
through books or otherwise) will esteem much higher 
what we are doing and suffering now than we 
ourselves, who are present and partly play the game 
ourselves. So God always remains despised when he 
is there, but when he is gone, people search and ask 
for him, but do not find him, as he says: "You will 
search for me and not find me", John 7:34. 

In the end, this history, described in this book, will 
be the same. Many will read it, but it will soon be 
forgotten, whether it is true that such terrible signs, 
which were well forgotten in the times of the prophets 
and apostles, and should be remembered, if we were 
not so unrepentant, stubborn people (that God have 
mercy!). But if we do not turn to it, then he will not 
celebrate it either, and press on such signs, and show 
himself to be seven times harder and stronger (as 3 
Mos. 26, 18) than we are. We will still have to die and

Although at this time, through the abundant grace 
and mercy of God, the holy gospel has gone forth 
abundantly everywhere, and especially among us 
Germans, and shines mightily, thereby causing 
countless abominations, 


The book is a collection of books, which have already 
been published, and which set down the errors and 
abuses, and cleared up many of the annoyances in 
the kingdom of Christ, so that one would have 
enough of the present and already exhausted books.

If the Lord is asleep or celebrating, throwing more 
and more other, new abominations and aversions in 
the way and raising them up, so that he hinders the 
course of the gospel and weakens its power, it is 
highly necessary that we also do not sleep and be 
safe, or keep quiet, but also stop more and more, and 
pursue the gospel diligently and honestly, as St. Paul 
admonishes us in 2 Timothy 4:2 and following. Paul 
exhorts us in 2 Tim. 4:2 ff. and says: "Preach the 
word, persevere, whether in season or out of season, 
reprove, admonish, exhort with all patience and 
teaching. For there will be a time when they will not 
suffer sound doctrine, but according to their own lusts 
they themselves will charge them with teachers after 
their ears itch, and will turn away their ears from the 
truth and turn to fables. But be thou valiant in all 
things, suffer thyself, do the work of an evangelical 
preacher, execute thy ministry honestly." 

3 Truly, we must not believe these words of St. 

Paul now; faith has come into our hands that we must 
unfortunately grasp and feel it. | will be silent, that we 
may see and hear how the people turn their ears from 
the truth of the gospel to the fables of the idolaters, 
and may not suffer teachers to preach what they 
desire to hear, and who can atone for the itching of 
their ears. Just as the enthusiasts do not like to 
preach about the sacrament; their ears almost itch, 
and they are so eager to hear how it is vain bread 
that they like to be tickled and scratched. They must 
be fine teachers, they invite them upon themselves, 
they can suffer them, yes, praise and extol them. 
(4) So the Anabaptists and other abusers atone for 
their lust and itching ears with the fables of the Spirit, 
and must be of the Spirit, let water be water. The 
apostle has truly painted them with the right color, 
and with the right words, that he ascribes to them, 
"They delight in fables, and their ears itch." For 
neither is there 


The only other cause of their turning away is that they 
have grown weary of the truth and have taken 
pleasure in hearing what they like, and after their ears 
itch. It is indeed difficult to preach in such a time, and 
if one should become impatient, to leave the ministry 
and speak: If you want to go to the devil, always go. 
For it is an unmistakable fact that on the one hand the 
papists rage against it with fire, sword, water, and all 
the power of the devil; on the other hand, the weary 
red-blooded spirits and lustful, frivolous hearts, with 
all the cunning of the devil, plot and lie against it. 
Without what is left of ingratitude and contempt 
among the unkind and among ourselves. 

But how should we do 1)? It is said, as St. Paul 
teaches here: "Suffer, teach and punish, forbear with 
all patience" [2 Tim. 4:2]. It is thus proclaimed, it shall 
thus go. Therefore nothing 2) else will come of it, we 
must let it go like this, and consider everything with 
patience, and nevertheless continue with teaching 
and punishing, and always carry on our teaching 
ministry and preaching work and do it honestly. God 
will find the itching ears and lustful hearts. 

Therefore, because this beautiful Psalm, which is 
one of the right main Psalms, and is rightly pointed by 
M. Aegidium to the main piece of our doctrine, which 
is called repentance and forgiveness of sins in Christ, 
| have considered it good to omit by printing, as well 
as apiece and help of our preaching ministry, against 
the itching, weary ears, whether it may also, by God's 
grace, ward off the fables, and still help some with the 
truth. Command the same to all lovers of truth, and 
wish them to read it with great fruit, to praise and 
thanksgiving to God the Father, in Christ Jesus our 
Savior, amen.

Preface to D. Urb. Rhegius' interpretation of the 52nd Psalm, 


against the bloodthirsty Saulites and Doegites. *) 
1541. 


1. although Doctor Urbanus Rhegius blessed 2c. 
neither needs me, nor any preface to his books, since 
he is not only highly enough learned for himself, but also 
highly famous among the teachers of the holy Christian 
church in our time, recognized as a pure, righteous 
preacher of the holy, pure, unadulterated gospel, held 
dear and valuable by all pious orthodox believers; for he 
has been an earnest enemy of your papal abominations 
and of all the mobs, as the 139th Psalm says: "I hate 
them in all earnestness. Psalm, v. 22, says: "| hate them 
in all earnestness, therefore they are enemy to me." But 
he warmly loved the pure word of God and acted with all 
diligence and faithfulness, as his writings abundantly 
testify. 

But because it should have been printed here, | 
wanted to have it confirmed with my testimony, 
especially because he means the bloodhound and 
assassin 1) so seriously, even if he does not name him; 
and to be seen, where he should have lived longer, he 
would have grabbed him much worse in the wool. 
Although all writing and complaining is too little about 
such an outrageous villain, that he should be reserved 
for God's wrath and punishment (which he now brazenly 
despises, and thus confidently runs and hurries to his 
damnation), it also helps to such haste of his damnation 
that one confidently writes against him, complains, cries 
and sighs, both to God and all creatures.

3 One can see from such a murderer that the papists 
despair of their cause and have decided to do everything 
knowingly and willfully that is dear to the devil, to the 
displeasure and displeasure of God; they have chosen 
him as their God, Lord, protection and comfort. Well 
then, let them go. It is cattle and stable, said the devil, 
and drove flies into his mother's butt. Such a god shall 
have such creatures; such trees, as Jothan Richt. 9, 14. 


says, shall have such rhamnum, briar, for a king. 

We should thank God that we learn from this evil what 
kind of fruit the devil and his minions are, that we may 
beware of them and pray all the more diligently. Without 
a doubt, God does not allow the devil to have such great 
willpower and sorrow; he will work much good in the end, 
as St. Augustine says: "God is so good that he would not 
let evil happen where he did not want to make something 
better out of it. He let Adam fall, but out of it came such 
great salvation that God became man and our Savior, 
and thereby honored human nature much more highly 
than the devil had defiled it by the fall; as St. Ambrose 


sings: O beata culpa, quae talem meruit habere 


redemptorem. Not that he loves or likes evil (otherwise 
he would not create good on it, but let evil remain and 
increase), but that he, to the chagrin of evil and the devil, 
may show his goodness the more abundantly, to his 
praise and honor.

Ingolstadt to Eck, was crowned a poet by Maximilian I, taught Protestantism at Halle am Jnn in 1522, and was therefore expelled from there. 
In 1530 he was in Augsburg, from where Duke Ernst of Brunswick took him as court preacher. In 1532 he came to Ltineburg to reform, in 
1533 to Hanover. In 1537 he attended the convent at Schmalkalden and in 1540 that at Hagenau. He died on May 23, 1541. (Erlangen

(5) And this rod of murder is good for chastening us 
according to the flesh, and for trying, testing, and 
purifying our faith, so that it will not only grow stronger in 
us and in ourselves, but will also spread to other 
countries. For it teaches and compels us to pray 
earnestly. But earnest prayer is an almighty, powerful 
and victorious thing. The papists and their god, the devil, 
should and must do nothing else with their raging and 
blustering, but blow into the ashes, so that the sparks 
and ashes fall into their eyes, yes, make our fire of faith 
and gospel shine and burn all the brighter, but finally 
disgrace and condemn themselves. Will keep silent that 
it also makes the worldly regiment valiant and careful, 
the lazy security, both, in spirit and flesh, that is, in the 
spiritual and 





secular! The people of the world have been driven out of 
the country by many evil, useless boys, whom the 
murderers and bloodhounds, the papists, so shamefully 
deprive of their lives and put their blood on their heads. 

We who believe have the right comfort of Christ our 
Lord [Matt. 10:30]: "The very hairs of your head are all 
numbered"; and [Zech. 2:8]: "He who touches you 
touches the apple of my eye"; therefore "take hold of 
your souls with patience” [Luc. 21:19]. Again, what the 
murderers and the papists have to wait for is sung in this 
psalm and many others. They want to have it that way, 
without our thanks; so let what is possible go, and give 
us room for the wrath of God, Rom. 12, 19. Our dear 
Lord keep and strengthen our faith, otherwise the body 
must perish, the belly with the food [1 Cor. 6, 13]. Amen.

To the Careful Johanni Secerio, Printer at Hagenau, 
Martinus Luther. 

1. grace and peace in Christ JEsu. Although | have 

never wanted to have a book printed as much as my 


Ecclesiastes, which | have read here in Wittenberg, by 
the grace of God (for | also consider it a useful and 
necessary book for all those who are to rule and preside 
over others in the external worldly regiment), it has not 
yet been possible for me to have so much time and 
strength, and | do not yet know when | will be able to do 
it, because the press and all kinds of business are 
increasing daily. 

(2) But | am all the more satisfied of this, because | 
hear that you have undertaken to print Johann Brentii's 
Ecclesiastes, to which | would also give way with all my 
heart, if my Ecclesiastes had already begun. For | am 
quite comforted that Christ our Lord, through the same 
man, will give us 


because he has been so richly endowed with the two 
high and proper episcopal gifts, of which Paul says [Tit. 
1:9], namely, that he is mighty to handle the salvific 
Scriptures and so well equipped to fight the mobs, and 
to do both with all humility, diligence and devotion. 

3. Christ, our dear Lord, wanted to keep his dear 
armor pure and fine, and to do much through him, as he 
has graciously begun to comfort us all, so that we may 
also see that we can rejoice in our poor little group. For 
otherwise the ugly, unkind looks of the wretched Satan 
seem to be everywhere, in his mobs, gushers, and wild, 
fierce, insolent spirits, as | have never read nor heard. 
Let us pray and cry out to Christ our Savior without 
ceasing, for Satan rages without ceasing. Hereby 
commanded by the grace of God, Amen.

9, preface about the D. Joh. Brenz interpretation of the prophet Amos. *) 


1530. 


To the man to be highly honored in Christ, D. 
Johann Brenz, the disciple and confessor of 
Christ, the faithful elder of the church at Hall. 

Grace and peace in Christ our Lord. Now, dearest 

Brenz, your Amos is coming back to you, which you 
sent to me a long time ago. It is not my fault that he 
came out very slowly, but the will of the one to whom 
you dedicated him. What reason moved him to do so, 
| do not know. But that you, according to the humility 
of your spirit, subject this whole interpretation to my 
judgment, that | should change it, add to it and do 
away with it what seems good to me, - that is far from 
me, that | should agree with you. For since it is 
already detestable among worldly people when 
someone wants to prove his wisdom by the book of 
another, it is even more detestable among Christians 
when someone arrogates to himself the mastery over 
the disciples of the same spirit. It is enough to test the 
spirits whether they are of God. If they are found 
proven, then one should immediately treat them with 
reverence and kiss them, give up the hope of mastery 
and rather become a disciple. For it cannot be 
otherwise than that where the Holy Spirit speaks, he 
speaks such things as to subdue every man who 
comes into this world and make him a disciple, since 
there is no measure to his wisdom. 

But besides this general praise of the spirit, my 
judgment of your writings is 





This is that my writings seem very contemptible to me 
when they are compared with yours or the writings of 
your equals. | am not flattering, nor am | telling lies, 
but | am also not playing a game, nor am | deceiving 
myself. Not the Brenz, but the spirit | praise, which in 
you is more lovely, gentler and calmer. Sodaun flows 
your speech, which is formed by the art of speech, 
purer, richer and more brilliant, and therefore moves 
more and delights more. My speech, however, 
besides being inexperienced and uneducated in the 
art of speech, emits nothing but a forest and 
disorderly heap of words, and suffers, moreover, 
from the fate of always being forced, as it were, to 
contend with innumerable monsters as a stormy and 
impetuous fighter. Therefore - if one may compare 
great things with small ones - | have received from 
the fourfold spirit of Elijah, 1 Kings 1) 19, 11. f., the 
[great strong] wind, the earthquake 2) and the fire, 
which tears the mountains and breaks the rocks, 3) 
but you and your kind the quiet gentle whirring, which 
refreshes. Thus it comes that even me, let alone

writings. He became a preacher in Halle in Swabia, and when he left there, he became the prefect of the church in Stuttgart and was given the supervision 
of the Tiibingen Academy, whereupon he died in 1570. His writing was reprinted at Hagenau in 1533 and at Schwabisch-Hall in 1544. The preface is found 
in Latin in Buddeus, Supplementum Epistolarum M. Lutheri, p. 192; in Coelestinus, torn. Ill, x>. 57; in De Wette, vol. IV, p. 148 and in the 
Erlanger, opp. var. ar*., tom. VII, p. 511. German in the Eislebenfchen edition, vol. II, p. 17; in the Altenburger, vol. V, p. 275; in the Leipziger, vol. XII,

than others, your writings and words are more 
pleasant. But | console myself with the fact that | 
believe, indeed know, that the heavenly Father of the 
house, with the greatness of his house, also needs 
one and the other, who is hard against the hard and 
rugged against the rugged, who belongs, as it were, 
like an evil wedge on the evil branches. And God, 
when he thunders, needs not only the moistening 
rain, but also the thunder that shakes and the 
lightning that cleanses the air, so that the earth may 
bear fruit more abundantly. 

But this gift of God | love and honor above all 
others in you, that in all your writings you so faithfully 
and loudly urge righteousness by faith, for this 
teaching is the head and the cornerstone, which 
alone begets, nourishes, builds, sustains and 
defends the church of God, and without it the church 
of God cannot exist even one hour, as you know and 
also believe, and so much in such a way persist. For 
no one can teach rightly in the church, nor 
successfully resist any adversary who does not hold 
this article, or, as Paul calls it [Titus 2:1], this 
wholesome doctrine, or, as the same Paul says, 
perseveres in it. Therefore | often wonder, and almost 
with displeasure, how St. Jerome deserved the name 
of a teacher of the church, and Origen that of a 
master of the churches after the time of the apostles, 
since in the books of both one cannot easily find three 
lines that teach of righteousness by faith, and one 
could not make a Christian out of all that they both 
wrote, so they indulge in spiritual interpretations of 
events, or let themselves be taken in by the splendor 
of works. And St. Augustine would have been no 
different if the Pelagians had not finally plagued him 
and driven him to defend righteousness by faith. He 
emerged from this struggle and trial as a true teacher 
of the Church, and almost as the only one after the 
apostles and first fathers of the Church. Not as if | 
wanted to disparage the famous fathers and, as 
Jerome himself calls it, the crows the 


1) but because | believe that we must all be warned 
to read the writings of the fathers with good judgment, 
and that with a very careful and sharp one, following 
the rule of the Holy Spirit [1 Thess. 5:21]: "Test all 
things," and again [1 John 4:1]: "Test the spirits," so 
that we may be pure animals that walk with cloven 
hooves. We see how those who do not do this are 
driven about by great winds of uncertain doctrine, and 
are tossed up and down by opinions that multiply ad 
infinitum, always learning and never coming to the 
knowledge of the truth. And we not only see this, but 
have also experienced it ourselves, since we were 
tossed about in just such eddies of doctrines, until the 
grace of God brought us into the harbor and built us 
on this sure rock, so that we are certain what we are 
to teach, learn and keep, and no longer waver so to 
and fro. Therefore | ask you, dearest Brenz, that you 
may continue, as you are doing, to carry out this 
teaching of righteousness diligently and to excess, in 
all things and wherever you are able. For otherwise 
the whole world is full enough of scribes, screamers 
and printers who bravely set aside this teaching. Yes, 
many pursue it, most (since they can do no harm 
otherwise) obscure and spoil it. And this is not to be 
wondered at. For the same is the some heel of the 
seed, which sits down against the old serpent, and 
crushes his head. Therefore, the devil again cannot 
help but chase after it. But though he can harm by his 
innumerable and exceedingly persistent pursuits, yet 
he cannot overcome and bruise, as it is written, "He 
shall bruise thy head." It is not written: Thou shalt 
tread down his heel or his head. The grace of our 
Lord JEsu Christ be with you, and pray for me. From 
the desert, August 26, in the year 1530.

1. There is no doubt in my mind that the last day 
is not far away, although the highly intelligent and 
overreasonable world does not worry about it, 
certainly, it is not yet necessary for a long time, and 
becomes longer and longer so wicked and evil, that 
even if no last day should not come, it would have to 
say itself, the highly intelligent reason: it may not and 
could not remain so long, but either a flood of sin or 
Sodom's example would have to come, where it is 
otherwise true that there is a God who punishes 
injustice; as from the beginning of the world the 
examples are innumerable, and still daily before our 
eyes, if the highly understanding and deeply blinded 
reason could see such cruel punishment, and be 
moved by it. 

It is an old legend, repeated by many teachers, 
that after the revelation of the end of Christ, people 
will become so wild that they will no longer know or 
think anything about God, but will do as the devil and 
the flesh teach. We see such a time fulfilled before 
our eyes. For after the horrible and terrible lies and 
deceptions of the wretched end-Christ, the Pabst, 
have now been revealed and brought to light by God's 
wonderful and special grace, people are beginning to 
believe nothing at all. And because they feel free from 
the bonds and ropes of the papacy, they also want to 
be free from the gospel and all of God's 
commandments. 


be what they desire and think good. That will be the 
end of the song, if God wills it. 

(3) And it is a strange thing that those who very 
earnestly pretend to cling firmly to the holy papacy 
and want to eat the gospel, along with all who believe 
in it, think much less of their end-Christ than Luther 
himself. For a new, strong planet would have to come 
to heaven, which would be able to do this, where the 
pope should or would banish them, so that they 
would suffer it, although they deserve it a thousand 
times and superfluously against his holy, spiritual, 
end-Christian right. They are so exceedingly good 
Lutheran and evil papal, and yet they want to be all 
too good papal and evil Lutheran. Thus it is that 
neither the Gospel nor Pabst's teaching has any 
power with them, one applies as much as the other, 
so that it may be fulfilled what is said above, how the 
last people on earth, after the revelation of the last of 
the Chalcs, the end of Christ, should no longer ask 
for God, but live according to his will. 

(4) Now all true Christians are well aware of this: 
He who does not respect the word of God does not 
respect God, whether he is the true God or the false 
God. For God has nothing to do with men except 
through His word, and without His word He is not 
known to us as a God, but is no God at all. Therefore, 
whoever respects neither the gospel nor Pabst's 
teaching has no God at all, neither the right nor the 
wrong one, but such are the cowardly swine.

thee to thyself. If you yourself

if you please us. On your side is the wrong (peccatum), 
if there is a wrong here; why did you not give it out 
yourself? Why did you suffer that 


*The first work of Melanchthon on the letter of Paul to the Romans was published by Luther without the knowledge and will of the 


author under the title: Annotationes Philippi Melanchthonis in epistolas Pauli ad Romanos et Corinthios. 1522. 4 This 
happened because Melanchthon could not be persuaded to publish it due to timidity. This writing did not pass into Melanchthon's works, but 
only two later adaptations, which are found there in the third and fourth volumes. It was later reprinted again, as can be seen from von der 
Hardts “.utoAraptm Imtlrori, torn. |, p. 137 and p. 201 and from des Olearius XutoKrapta 1,nttreri p. 13. Walch had an edition in his hands

in 1612 in octavo. This manuscript has also been translated into German. Walch used a translation that had the title: "*nnotation68 Philippen 
Melanchthons. Verzeichnung und kirtzliche Anzeigung des rechten und eigentlichen Verstands der Epistel, die St. Paul zu den Rémern 
geschrieben hat, verdeutscht." Von der Hardt, |. 6. p. 244, mentions an "Interpretation of the Epistles of St. Paul, one to the Romans and two 
to the Corinthians, Philippi Melancht., Germanized by Johannem Agricolam Eislebiensem 2c. Walch notes that the latter translation seems 
to be different from the former, but he cannot say for sure, since he has not seen it himself. Furthermore, he states: In Olearius, p. 13, "I find 
under the year 1522 annot. ?uii. IVlol. in 6p. acl Horn, translated by Luther, together with a preface in 4.", but adds, as we think, nnt rightly:

| have so often begged, commanded and urged you in 
vain to give them up? This is my excuse against you; for 
| want to be and be called your thief, and | am not afraid 
of your future complaints or accusations. By the way, to 
those of whom you perhaps suspect that they will turn 
up their noses, or of whom you fear that not enough has 
been done for them, | will say this: Give out something 
better. | ascribe to you with truth that which the godless 
Thomists liefully ascribe to their Thomas, namely, that 
no one has written better about St. Paul. For Satan 
persuaded them to boast about their Thomas, so that 
they would spread his ungodly teachings and poison. | 
know from what spirit and judgment | am saying this 
about you. What is it to you if those world-famous 1) 
people and giants mock this judgment of mine? Mine is 
the danger. Yes, | want to irritate these wise men even 
more, and say: the interpretations of Jerome and Origen 
are nothing but childish and inconsistent things, if they 
are compared with your remarks. You will say: Why is it 
necessary to provoke even the most gifted people to 
envy me so much? Nevertheless, be humble, but let me 
be proud of you. Who then has prevented these highest 
spirits from issuing something better, and to expose the 
outrageousness of my judgment? If only God wanted 
them to be such people, who would be able to do 
something better! Yes, | also threaten you that | will steal 
even further and also publish what you have prepared 
about Genesis and the Gospels of Matthew and John, if 
you do not come first yourself. You say that one should 
only read the Scriptures. 


1) In the word famosi there is an ambiguity (famous and 
infamous) that cannot be rendered in German. 





read without interpretations. You rightly say this of 
Jerome and Origen and Thomas and the like of them. 
For they have written interpretations in which they have 
taught rather what is theirs than what is Paul's, or 
Christian things. No one will call your remarks an 
interpretation, but only a guide to reading the Scriptures 
and recognizing Christ, which none of the interpretations 
has yet accomplished, at least none that is available. For 
what you claim, that not enough has been done for you 
in all respects by your notes, it takes effort and work for 
me to believe you; but behold, | believe that you have 
not done enough for yourself. This is neither sought in 
you nor demanded of you; rather, we also want Paul to 
retain his honor, so that no one may boast that Philip is 
higher than Paul or equal to him. It is enough for you that 
you are exceedingly close to Paul. We envy none: who 
can come nearer. We know that you are nothing. Again, 
we know that Christ is all in all. If he speaks through his 
ass, it will be pleasing; why should it be displeasing if he 
speaks through a man? Are you not a man? Are you not 
Christ's? Is not his mind in thee? Now if thou thyself wilt 
adorn and increase this little book with more graceful 
speech and richer learning, it shall be pleasant. In the 
meantime, it will also be pleasant against your will that 
we take possession of the things and the mind of Paul, 
which have been brought to light through your service. | 
do not ask for your forgiveness if | offend you by doing

on the epistle to the Colossians, *)

(1) There you have another fine, useful book, my dear 
friends, namely St. Paul's Epistle to the Colossians, with 
Magistri Philippi Melanchthon's instruction and teaching; 
in it is very finely, briefly, and yet clearly and abundantly 
summarized, what Christian doctrine and life is about, so 
that this booklet may be called a large book, and again, 
this booklet may be called a small booklet, and each one 
may carry it with him in his busem as his Christian 
treasure to practice daily. | myself prefer such Magistri 
Philipp's books to mine, and | also prefer to see them

Philipps leads along neatly and quietly, balleting and

given him his gifts abundantly. O the blessed time, if our 
damned ingratitude would let us recognize this. 1) What 
a treasure it should have been for all the world twenty 
years ago, where one could have had such a book! But 
now it has unfortunately come to the point that the Jews

We have grown weary of the bread of heaven, and we 
want to eat ribs and garlic in Egypt; even worse, we must 
throw pearls to the dogs, and sanctuary to the swine, 
which tear and bite us for it. If the word is taken from us 
again, we will cry out in vain, as our ancestors did, and 
no one will listen to us. 

But this booklet (if God wills it) will come to find honor 
and praise, love and thanksgiving. For a good word finds 
a good place, and God's word does not go forth in vain, 
nor does it return empty, as we have promise and 
comfort in the Scriptures [lsa. 55:10]. This booklet shall 
be commanded to the same quiet, pious hearts, which

more the more joyful it shall be to eat, so that they do 
not remember the Egyptian ribs and garlic [Numbers

honor of God, in Christ Jesus our Lord and Savior, to 
whom thanks be given forever for all His abundant,

*) Walch has assumed that this preface, as well as Melanchthon's writing: hilippi Melanchthonis Scholia in Epistolam ad 
Colossenses recognita. Wittenbergae 1528. 8. was originally written in Latin. This is erroneous, however, because the Latin edition 
does not contain this preface. Only in 1529 did Luther write it in German for the translation that Justus Jonas published under the following 
title: "Die Epistel S. Pauli zun Colossern durch Philippum Melanchton ym latein zum andern mal ausgelegt, verdendscht durch Justum Jonam

Preface to an Unnamed Commentary on the Revelation of St. John, *) 


1528. 
Newly translated from the Latin. 


Martin Luther to the Godly Reader. 


Grace and peace in Christ! First of all, | beg you, 
whoever you may be, who read this interpretation, that 
you may not believe that we have published something 
fictitious. | testify (if | have any credibility) that this book 


(codicem) WaS sent to me by very good men from the 
outermost borders of Germany, namely from the region 
of Poland and Ljubljana, unshaped by letters and 
syllables, which actually testify to its time, so that | 
cannot deny that it was written about seventy years 
before our time. From the book itself, however, it can be 
sufficiently recognized that the author of this 
interpretation lived at the time when the exceedingly 
great monster of the (so-called) last schism existed, 
which was finally stilled and ended by the miserable 
Concilium at Costnitz through the blood of John Hus and 
Jerome of Prague, as it were through a sacrifice. For the 
histories testify that through this schism, for forty years, 
there was a triple papacy in one and the same body of 
the church (namely, the derived one), by which God, as 
a certain miraculous sign of discord, undoubtedly 
wanted to indicate that shortly the end of the Antichrist 
would be there. Since no one understood this at that 
time, it pleased God to add a very clear word to this 
obvious and remarkable sign, namely the author of this 
book and many men like him, who distinguished 
themselves through holy life and scholarship; as he did 
not want to deceive the church and its people. 





Even though the wicked do not even understand or 
realize (this is Pharaoh's blindness) what God threatens 
or promises, he sends some people like Elijah and 
Elisha or other prophets to them. This has also been 
sufficiently demonstrated by the doings and the outcome 
of the Concilium at Costnitz. 


You should know, dear reader, that this preface is 
made by us for the sake of announcing to the world that 
we are not the first to declare the Pabstacy to be the 
kingdom of the Antichrist, since so many years before us 
so many and so great men (whose number is great and 
whose memory is eternal) have dared to say the same 
thing so clearly and obviously, and with great spirit and 
bravery, since they were driven away by the ravages of 
papal tyranny even to the farthest ends of the world and 
suffered the cruelest tortures. Nevertheless, they have 
bravely and faithfully persevered in the confession of the 
truth, so that we, although we are far more learned and 
free than they at this time, must nevertheless be 
ashamed, because, since they were held in such great 
ignorance and captivity, they have nevertheless been 
stronger and bolder than we in such great spirit and 
bravery. For even though this author was among the first 
in his time (as | believe) to seek scholarship and holy 
living most diligently, he, hindered by the infirmities of 
his time and by the realm of darkness, could neither 
speak it so purely nor see it so fully as we speak and see 
it in our time. Nevertheless, he says it quite rightly and 
truly that the pope (as he then is)

is the Antichrist, and that with undoubted faith and 
conscience and with the most reliable reasons of proof. 
Namely, he is a witness decreed by God so many years 
before us, in order to confirm our doctrine, which those 
wretched yeasts (as the last breath of the Antichrist, so 
to speak) now want to have eradicated with great and 
many, but vain and futile counseling suggestions. For 
also for us these bodies of the saints rise again with the 
resurrected gospel of Christ and give us a great 
confidence that these wretched bishops, the outermost 
adversaries of Christ (even though they rely in the 
greatest despair on their Herod and Pilate). 





They will not be able to do anything by their loud and 
terrible threats, with which they have started badly and 
as an extreme and futile remedy to heal their lack of 
confidence and their extremely evil conscience. Christ, 
who by his word smote the body of this abomination, and 
then by the sword of Caesar wounded the head, will not 
cease nor desist, until he shall utterly tread down and 
destroy even the dying and vainly puffing up members. 
Let us only pray that he who has begun may also 
accomplish his work for his glory and for our salvation. 
Let every one who loves Christ say Amen. Amen.

1. preface to the booklet, what the old and new man is, *) 


December 1516. 


Before speech. 

First of all, this booklet admonishes all who want to read 
and understand it, especially those who are of sound 
reason and sensible mind, not to rush to judgment, 
because in some words it seems incompetent, or to 
speak from the way of ordinary preachers and teachers. 
Yes, it does not float above, like foam on the water, but 
it is chosen from the bottom of the Jordan by a true 
Israelite, which name God knows and whom He has 
chosen. 





wants to know it. For this time the booklet is found 
without title and name, but to estimate by possible 
memory the matter is almost after the manner of the 
enlightened Doctor Tauleri, Order of Preachers. Now as 
to all that is true, thorough teaching of the Holy 
Scriptures must make fools, or become fools, as the 
Apostle Paul touches, 1 Cor. 1, 23: "We preach Christ, 
a foolishness to the Gentiles, but a wisdom of God to the 
saints." 
F. Martinus Luder 
subscripsit. 





*The booklet mentioned in the title is a fragment of the "German Theology", about the fourth part of this writing (only so much had 


come to Luther's hands at that time), which he published under the following title: "Eyn geystlich edles Buchleynn von rechter underscheyd 
vnd Vorstand, was der alt vn new mensche sey. What Adam's child is, and what God's child is. And how Ada died to us, and Christ first fell." 
At the end: "Printed in Wittenberg by Joanne Grunenbergk. Anno, nach Christ geburt Tausent funffhundert vn jm sechtzenden jar am tag

in the "Gesammtausgabe": in the Eisleben one, vol. |, p. 16; then in the Altenburg one, vol. I, p. 13; in the Leipzig one, vol. XXII, appendix p. 
74; in the Erlanger one, vol. 63, p. 238 and in the Weimar one, vol. |, p. 153. Also in Léscher, Reformations-Acteu, vol. |, p. 301. We give the

*) Not long after Luther had published the fragment with its preface mentioned in the previous number, he had received a manuscript 
containing the entire scripture, which he also published. On June 4, 1518, the new edition was completed, and appeared under the title: "Eyn 
deutsch Theologia, das ist Eyn edles Buchleyn, von rechtem Vorstand, was Adam vnd Christus sey, vnd wie Adam yn vns sterben vnd 
Christus erstem fall." At the end: "Printed in Wittenburg by Joannem Griinenberg. After Christ's birth thousand five hundred, and in the eightieth 
year." Already in the same year, this writing was reprinted in Leipzig, and with a different title, namely "Theologia Teutsch", by Silvanus Ottmar 
in Augsburg. Further, in 1519, again at Leipzig, and under the changed title at Strasbourg by Johannes Knoblouch. For the period from 1518 
to 1520, the Weimar edition lists nine different printings. Until recent times, Franz Pfeiffer counted seventy different editions of the "German 
Theology," and yet several have remained unknown to him. "Luther's editions (so says the Weimar edition) are based on manuscripts that 
have been lost to us. It was not until the middle of our century that a manuscript containing this work was discovered again, but of fairly recent 
origin: it dates from 1497. According to this, Franz Pfeiffer first published the 'Theologia deutsch' in 1851, then improved it and added a new 
translation, and since then Luther's editions have come into disrepute. Pfeiffer's text alone is significantly inferior to Luther's: it is often only a 
matte extension, not a more complete reproduction of the original." The original is published in its entirety by |. K. F. Knaake: "Ein deutsch 
Theologia." Weimar, H. Bohlau. 1883.In all of the previously mentioned editions, Luther's preface is at the very beginning. This is followed by 
a short preface, already found in the manuscript of 1497, according to which the author of the work had been "a priest and a custos in the 
German gentlemen's house at Frankfurt." In the collections of Luther's works, our preface is found: in the Eisleben one, vol. |, p. 1; in the 
Altenburg one, vol. |, p. 12; in the Leipzig one, vol. XXII, appendix p. 74, and in Walch with an incorrect date (namely 1516) but with good text; 
conversely (so says the Weimar edition) with bad text but correct date in the Erlanger, vol. 63, p. 238, "although in the introduction it is brazenly 
claimed that one follows the “Wittenberg] ‘original print’, since in reality a Strasbourg edition, not described at all, is taken as a basis". We give 
the text according to the Weimar edition, which is printed there in Vol. |, p. 378 f. according to the original.

Doctor Martinus Luther, 
Augustinians at Wittenberg. 


3, Preface to Augustine's book de spiritu et litera, * 


1518. 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


It is not without reason that this book of St. Augustine 
should be read publicly in this school, especially at this 
time of ours, when the papists, more than the Pelagians, 
are also furiously persecuting the grace of God by which 
we are made righteous by grace in Christ, so that they 
may defend and fortify their credentials, masses and 
merits. For this reason, those who are concerned with 
theology must familiarize themselves with this book, so 
that they may resist and refute the angry speeches of 
the papists, who cry out that we are bringing a new kind 
of doctrine into the church. For this book of Augustine is 
not new, but convicts the papists that they are the 
inventors of new doctrines, who have introduced their 
impious and blasphemous opinions alongside this old 
doctrine put forward by the apostles, with which they 
have scourged, crucified and buried it. 

There goes with them an even devilish speech, which, 
however, is taken by them for a theological rule, namely, 
that Augustine had gone too far in these things in his 
words. For in such a way they sought to nullify the 
teaching and the work of the holy man, so that they 
would not be able to be recognized by the reputation of 


of St. Augustine, and forced to let go of their worthless 
little bundles. Thereby they bear witness against 
themselves that they have not taught and defended their 
abominations out of ignorance, since they knew and 
read very well that Augustine teaches completely 
different from them. One of them, Gregory of Rimini 


(Ariminensis), dared to bring Augustine to Paris and to 
oppose him to the Sophists in this matter, but he did not 
succeed, because the theologians of the Sorbonne 
suppressed him and, according to their Pharisaic 
arrogance, decided that Augustine had gone too far in 
his speeches. 

Since it is not within everyone's means to acquire all 
of Augustine's works, it seemed necessary to publish 
one and the other of St. Augustine's books for the less 
able, so that everyone might see that we are neither the 
first nor the only ones, who have dared to challenge the 
godless theology of the Sophists, that neither we, but 
rather they themselves, have been the originators of 
new things in the Church, which have left the limits set 
by the Fathers and have led the hearts of the simple 
along their crooked paths and 





*The book to which Luther wrote this preface was published in 1518 in Wittenberg in octavo under the title: Augustini liber de 
spiritu et litera, cum praefatione et praemonitione lectoris. Another edition there in 1545. 8. does not contain Luther's preface, 
but, as Walch, Vol. XXIll, p. 15 notes, "another preface, which tastes like Melanchthon's writing and method. In Latin, Luther's preface is 
found in Aurifaber's collection of letters, tom. |, toi. 55 with the remark: ex VutoAraptio Ue“ripta, and printed from it in the Erlangen edition, 
opp. var. ar*., tom. VII, p. 488. German in the Leipzig edition, vol. XXII, appendix p. 75. We have retranslated according to Aurifaber.

1) have fallen into error (as the Scriptures [Ps. 
125:5, 95:10] speak), so that, according to the 
words of the prophet, Christ's people have forgotten 
him since time immemorial and have been forced to 
fornicate with innumerable wooers who have left 
them no rest by day or by night. 

In praise of Augustine, however, I will say nothing 
else here than this one thing, which, taught by 
experience, I can assert with certainty, that, 
according to sacred Scripture, there is no teacher in 
the Church who can be compared with him in 
Christian learning. To others I concede their praise; 
they may speak like Chrysostom, be versed in secular 
sciences like Jerome; but if you gather them all in 
one heap-

you will not find half as much as in Augustine alone. 
Therefore, if you can and have time, choose this St. 
Augustine as your teacher according to the holy 
scriptures, especially where he argues against the 
Pelagians, Donatists and Manichaeans. For he is a 
man of thorough learning in Christ. Admittedly, he 
also wrote several books at the beginning of his 
activity, but I think that you should read these, 
because you have superfluous and idle hours, as I 
have lost not a few of them with Jerome, Chrysostom 
and similar people. If you do not believe me, who 
have experienced it, then you can certainly make the 
attempt yourself and regret it afterwards, just as I 
did. May our Lord guide and sustain us by His Holy 
Spirit, for His glory and for our blessedness. Amen. 


4, Passional Christi and Antichrist; with Luther's afterword. 


About the middle of May 1521. 


D. G. Kawerau wrote a very extensive introduction 
to this writing - in the Weimar edition it takes up 
twenty-four pages - from which we give a short 
(often copied verbatim) excerpt below. 


The English reformer Johann Wiklef already 
recognized the pope as the Antichrist, but only in his 
later years. In his treatise De Christo et suo 
adversario Antichristo, in twelve "conditiones 
papae Christo contrariae" or "cases (casus), in 
which the pope is an adversary against Jesus Christ," 
he elaborates the contrast between Christ and the 
antichrist, the pope, in full decisiveness and sharp 
drawing in picture and counter-picture. Antichrist (he 
says) is rightly called the one who is contrary to Christ 
in life and teaching. The first sentence of his series 
of antitheses reads: Christ is the truth, the pope the 
principle of lies (in words, writings, works). In part, 
we already find the same images here as in our 
Passional, e.g.: Christ chooses poverty, the pope 
desires worldly splendor; Christ wants his disciples to 
preach the gospel to the nations, the pope and his 
followers are enthroned either in the church or in the 
church. 





Christ disdains worldly rule, the pope claims the reign 
over the kingdoms of the world; Christ is obedient to 
the emperor, the pope weakens the worldly power; 
Christ is without pomp and ready to serve (entry into 
Jerusalem and foot washing), the pope holds 
splendid court and demands that the emperor also 
render him servile services (papal cavalcade and 
kissing the pope's feet) 2c. Nevertheless, we lack any 
evidence that Wiklef's series of antitheses would 
have directly influenced Cranach's work or would 
have been known in Wittenberg. 2) 

But, inspired by Wiklef's tract, in Hussite circles the 
juxtaposition of Christ and the Antichrist did not only 
go into the Hussite

This was not only the beginning of a series of 
pamphlets against the papacy, which lasted through 
the entire sixteenth century, but went one step 
further and added the image to the word. In 1476, 
the town scribe of Prague, Procop, tells in his 
chronicle that those "Germans from Dresden", who 
held a school in the new town of Prague, especially 
that Peter, who had advised Jakob von Mies] to 
dispense the chalice [1414], "carried around boards 
against the pope, which were provided with writing 
and pictures: how Christ rides on a donkey, and the 
apostles follow him barefoot, and the pope goes 
along with the cardinals made of mules and in 
splendid clothes" 2c. Another writing from the year 
1521 tells of Hus himself that he had the very same 
picture of the entry into Jerusalem painted in the 
church on one side, on the other the pope with his 
retinue in great splendor. "Hus said to the 
Bohemians: Which do you want to follow, the humble 
Jesus with his disciples, or do you want to follow the 
proud hopeful Pope with his golden pieces and 
adornments?" 2c. From these and other old 
testimonies it is certain that this image and counter- 
image, called "old Bohemian", with accompanying 
inscriptions, dates from _pre-Reformation times. 
Flacius tells of an old book from the middle of the 
fifteenth century (after 1438), "in which are various 
pictures: how Christ drives the sellers and the buyers 
out of the temple, washes the feet of the apostles; 
how the pope sits on his glorious throne, and of other 
persons. Also attached to each of these pictures are 
sayings from the Holy Scriptures, the Fathers and the 
Decree, which are mostly directed against the 
ignorance, the shameful life, the various errors of the 
pope and the clergy, and against their adherence to 
false doctrine. From this book, as a sample, he shares 
a verse that was written over the picture that 
depicted the pope "sitting on his throne and granting 
various so-called graces to those who ask for them. 
It is noteworthy that the Leipzig professor of theology 
Nicolaus Weigel (died 1444) in an expert opinion on 
a writing of the Franciscan Matthias Déring, 2) in 
which he criticized the author because of the in it 
occurring 


1) The last two lines of the inscription are found in the penultimate 
number of this volume, "Description of Court Life." 

2) Flacius published his writing in 1550 under the title: 
Confutatio primatus papae, ante mcentum annos a 


quodam pio scripta. 





Antitheses on Christ and his vicarius as heretics, 
accurately describes several pairs of images depicting 
the contrast between Christ and the pope, putting it 
beyond doubt that he already had Hussite imagery in 
mind. 

Thus we see that not only the basic idea of the 
Passion, but also a large part of the antitheses of the 
Passion existed in word and image before Cranach, 
and it is possible that one or the other of the earlier 
antitheses was known in Wittenberg at the time of 
the publication of the Passion. Relations between 
Bohemia and Wittenberg had existed since 1519, but 
it must not be overlooked to what extent Luther's 
own course of development towards Pabstism and his 
previous literary work had prepared the way for 
Cranach's Passional. Only gradually, in his struggle 
with Rome, had he begun to suspect that it was the 
power of antichristianity against which he had 
undertaken to fight. On December 11, 1518, he wrote 
to Wenceslaus Link (De Wette, Vol. I, 193): "I will 
send you my little works (nugas), so that you may 
see whether my suspicion is correct, that that right 
Antichrist, as Paul describes him [2 Thess. 2], reigns 
in the Roman court; that he is nowadays worse than 
the Turks, I believe I can prove." A quarter of a year 
later, as he was preparing for the Leipzig disputation, 
he wrote to Spalatin on March 13, 1519 (De Wette, 
vol. I, 239): "I am also dealing for my disputation 
with the decrees of the popes, and (I tell you this in 
your ear) I do not know whether the pope is the 
antichrist himself or his apostle: so miserably is Christ 
profaned and crucified by him in the decrees (that is 
the currency)." These are still confidential remarks 
that he utters against his best friends. But already 
three months later, about the middle of June 1519, 
shortly before the Leipzig Disputation, he publicly 
testified in the "Erlauterung Uber seine dreizehnte 
Thesis von der Gewalt des Pabstes" (Explanation of 
his thirteenth thesis on the power of the pope) that 
the pope was the Antichrist who sat in the middle of 
the temple of God, because the indignation over the 
lying assertion of canon law that all the churches of 
the world had been founded from Rome (St. Louis 
edition, vol. XVIII, 756 ff.), but Peter had received 
from Christ "the authority both over the earthly and 
the heavenly kingdom", drives him to the 
exclamation: "nevertheless we dream that it stands 
well with the church, and do not recognize the 
Antichrist in the midst of the temple !" After having 
read the book of Laurentius Valla, edited by Hiitten,

Constantius," he writes to Spalatin on February 24, 
1520 (De Wette, vol. I, 420): "I am so cornered [by 
the impudent lies of the Decretals, which have taken 
the place of the Articles of Faith] that I almost cannot 
doubt that the Pope is quite actually that Antichrist 
whom the world expects according to generally 
accepted opinion: so much does everything he lives, 
does, speaks, and orders fit." In the writing "To the 
Christian Nobility of the German Nation," which 
appeared in August 1520 (St. Louis Edition, Vol. X, 
266), he proves (and this is not the least of the 
contents of this writing) that antichristianity had 
become manifest in the Pabst. When Luther sent his 
writing "Von der Freiheit eines Christenmenschen" 
(St. Louis edition, vol. XIX, 986 and introduction ibid, 
p. 45 f.) with a letter to Pope Leo (Nov. 1520), he 
reminded him (De Wette, vol. I, 514) "how unequal 
Christ and his governors are," and boldly put the 
question to him: "What might such a pope be but a 
final Christian and an idol?" Luther responded to the 
papal bull of excommunication against him in about 
November 1520 (compare Luther's letter to Spalatin 
of Nov. 4, 1520, De Wette, vol. I, 521) with the 
writing "Wider die Bulle des Endchrists," which he 
published in both Latin and German (Walch, old 
edition, vol. XV, 1732). On Dec. 10, 1520, Luther 
publicly burned canon law, and justified this in the 
writing that went out before the end of the year 
(Walch, old edition, vol. XV, 1927): "Warum des 
Pabsts und seiner Jiinger Biicher verbrannt sind." 
(Why the Pope's and his disciples' books are burned). 
In it he indicates thirty "articles and errors in spiritual 
law and papal books," "therefore they are to be 
burned and avoided," to which he mostly contrasts 
Bible words. A number of these sentences recur in 
the Passional. Therefore, this writing, along with "To 
the Christian Nobility," seems to have been the direct 
model for Cranach's Passional 1). 

For the history of the origin of our Passionale we 
have only scanty testimonies at our disposal, namely 
two passages from Luther's letters. The first from a 
letter to Spalatin, dated March 7. 


1) The word "Passional" has long been used to refer not only 
specifically to the history of the Passion, but also to the history of the 
lite of Christ, Mary, and the saints. These books were traditionally 
equipped with woodcuts; thus the word "Passional" gets the meaning: 
a picture book on the history of Christ or the saints. (Weim. Edition) 





1521 (one day after the imperial citation to Worms 
had been drawn up), reads (De Wette, vol. I, 571): 
Has effigies jussit Lucas a me subscribi et ad 
te mitti. Jam paratur Antithesis figurata Christi 
et Papae, bonus 2) pro laicis liber. [[Lucas 
(Cranach) has asked me to sign these images and 
send them to you; you will get them (to the 
Churfiirst?). Now the juxtaposition of Christ and the 
Pope in pictures; a good book for the laity]. Until 
recent times, this entire passage was referred to the 
Passional, as Aurifaber already understood it in the 
Eisleben Collection, Vol. I, Bl. 44k, where he writes: 
"These figures of the kingdom of the Lord Christ and 
Antichrist are by Lucas Cranach the Elder, and the 
signature of D. Martin Luther, as the holy man of God 
himself testifies in the first Latin tome of his epistles" 
(Aurifaber's collection of letters, tom. I, kok 313 k). 


He was followed by Seckendorf (Hist. Luth., lib. I, 


§ XCI (3)), who says that the famous painter Lucas 
Cranach dared to cut images in wood, which depicted 
the opposite behavior of Christ and the Antichrist: "to 
these images (he says) Luther added inscriptions, 
and sent them to Spalatin on March 7". According to 
this, this view did not only prevail in the literature, 
but further things were added. The biographer of 
Cranach, Johann Heller, writes: "From Luther's 
writings it is known that he saw these illustrations 
beautifully executed in colors [Has effigies!] by 
Cranach, and that he took care of their publication, 
which he then provided with suitable text. He sent 
such a copy to G. Spalatin on May 7 [read: March] 
1521. The first edition appeared in February 1521." 
One then probably referred the first sentence of that 
letter to the German, the second to the Latin edition 
of our writing, and thus dated the appearance of the 
latter to February, and had then also gained a certain 
statement about Luther's share in Cranach's work. 
But with an unbiased reading, the justification to 
understand Has effigies of the same pictures as 
Antithesis figurata falls away. If by Antithesis the 
Latin edition is meant, then it would be surprising 
that this and not the German edition would be 
praised as "a good book for the laity". However, it 
cannot be denied that the designation used here for 
the Passional corresponds almost literally with the 
title of the Latin edition. 


2) In the editions: Cone ot; in the original ot is missing.

The painting is in accordance with the book. - It 
should also be mentioned here that in the Zimmer 
Chronicle it is reported that the Spaniards smashed 
and destroyed Cranach's paintings in Torgau Castle 
in 1547 because they contained "the comparison of 
Christ and the Pope", "as such went out in print years 
ago". Then we would have the pictures of the 
Passion, painted by Cranach, which might have been 
sent to Spalatin. But this news loses its credibility by 
the fact that the Spaniards did not come to Torgau 
at that time; the passage remained denied to the 
imperial troops. King Ferdinand, however, who came 
to the city with his sons and let himself be led into 
the castle to see whether, as had been announced, 
all kinds of defamatory and mocking pictures of the 
emperor and the pope were hung up in the manorial 
rooms, found none of them. There can be no doubt 
that the last sentence of the passage quoted from 
Luther's letters refers to the Passional, but the first 
sentence: Has effigies etc. does not. Therefore, 
Knaake raised the objection in 1871 that this 
sentence does not refer to the pictures of the 
Passion, but to individual pictures, which Luther took 
over from Cranach, for example, for further 
transportation to the Elector. It will not be possible 
to determine what kind of pictures they were. In any 
case, the expression effigies leads to individual 
pictures, not to a writing decorated with illustrations. 
Knaake's assumption has recently found more and 
more general approval. 1) All that we can gather with 
certainty from the quoted passage in the letter is that 
Luther knew about the creation and preparation of 
our writing, that he approved of the plan of the same, 
and that on March 7, one was busy in Wittenberg 
with the production of the Passionale; and with great 
probability it follows that Cranach, the maker of the 
first mentioned pictures, would also have made those 
of the Passionale. The pictures of the Passionals do 
not bear Cranach's mark, because the book was 
published anonymously, but they do show Cranach's 
hand, as Cranach's most recent biographer, Lindau, 
judged. 

More is offered by the second passage, which is 
found in a letter of Luther to Melanchthon, dated May 
26, 1521. From the Wartburg, Luther writes (De 
Wette, Vol. II, 9): Passionale anti- theton mire 
placet. Joh. Schwertfeger in ea opera video tibi 
succenturiatum [The Passio- 


1) Duties with him: Lenz, Kawerau, Kolde, Enders, Lehfeldt and 
others. 


Passional Christi and Antichrist: (Preface).

nal in image and counter-image pleases me quite 
extraordinarily. I see that Johann Schwertfeger has 
helped you with this work]. Here we are talking about 
the German edition, whose title Luther mentions. The 
extremely high praise that he gives to this work leads 
to the assumption that he does not consider himself 
to be the editor, since it is otherwise his manner to 
express himself very reservedly or even disparagingly 
about his own work. Furthermore, we see that Luther 
knows about the collaboration of Melanchthon and 
Schwertfeger. It cannot be doubted that 
Melanchthon's work is to be sought in the biblical 
passages, that of the Wittenberg jurist Schwertfeger 
in the passages from canon law. We will not be 
mistaken if we attribute the translation of the biblical 
passages to Melanchthon, since the translation of the 
same is obviously not by Luther. Furthermore, it is 
clear that a finished copy of the German edition did 
not reach Luther's hands until the end of May. From 
this it follows that the writing was published only 
now, namely about the middle of May - not already 
in February or March. This is confirmed by a letter of 
the Electoral Council Bernhard von Hirschfeld to the 
Nuremberg Councilman Anton Tiicher of May 29. 
From this letter we learn that the Elector only came 
across this document when he returned from the Diet 
of Worms and passed through Wirzburg. The 
Passional must have been sent to him directly from 
Wittenberg. Hirschfeld, who was one of the Prince's 
companions, immediately sent a copy to Tucher as a 
remarkable novelty, which shows that he assumed 
that the booklet was not yet known in Nuremberg. 2) 

Between the time when Luther wrote to Link 
(March 7, 1521] that our Scripture would be 
prepared, and the day when he left for Worms [April 
3, 1521], there is still almost a whole month, and it 
can be expected that during this time Luther will also 
spend a part of his time, which, however, was taken 
up beyond all measure 3). 


2) Concerning a passage from a letter of Duke Johann Friedrich to 
Spalatin of May 26, 1521: "Martinus [Luther's] Passion pleases me 
well, shall also remain concealed until our Lord's Resurrection, but in 
the right way," the Weimar edition notes that the same is erroneously 
referred to our writing by Cyprian, "Nutzliche Urkunden," Vol. Il, p. 
259, and still by Késtlin, "Martin Luther," Vol. | (3), p. 432. - The word 
"Passion" will not refer to the Passional, but to Luther's hidden stay at 
the Wartburg.

Luther had spent a great deal of time and effort on 
this extremely important writing. How far it had 
progressed at the time of his departure, and how 
much Luther had done on the signatures himself, 
cannot be determined. In any case, the Passional 
was completed by Melanchthon and Schwertfeger. 
But the plan for it certainly came from Luther - not 
from the timid Melanchthon - and Cranach may have 
been inspired to produce the images not only by 
Luther's writings, but also by Luther's direct request; 
we also have to think of Luther as a consultant for 
image and word. When the Passional was completed, 
it met with Luther's full approval. Therefore, we have 
no hesitation in considering this work to be the work 
of Luther, in spite of the collaboration of others. 

All old editions of the Passionale are, as already 
mentioned, anonymous and have only the title: 
"Passional Christi und Antichristi" (all in quarto), 
without indication of time, place and printer, with the 
only exception of the Low German edition, where at 
the end is written: "Wittenberg anno 1526." The 
Weimar edition lists seven different German editions, 
of which the first two are printed in Wittenberg by 
Johann Grunenberg, the two following, which contain 
four more pictures, are (not by Melchior Sachse in 
Erfurt, but [Weim. Ausg., Vol. IX, p. 699, note 2]) 
printed in Strasbourg; two others, reprints of the 
second Wittenberg edition, by Matthes Maler in 
Erfurt. The Latin edition is entitled Antithesis 
figurata vitae Christi et Antichristi. The printer 
is Johann Grunenberg, as in the previously 
mentioned Wittenberg editions. The woodblocks are 
the same as in the second German edition, in the last 
edition of which, first on sheet Bd, a longer break 
appears in the upper border line of the woodcut, 
which then also reappears in the Latin edition. From 
this results un- 


Johann Poliander in the Weimar edition fill 75 pages, Weim. Ausg., 
vol. IX, pp. 601-676; eight letters, which take up 16 pages in the De 
Wetteschen collection of letters. Furthermore, three large writings 
came out during this time: "Das Magnificat" (St. Louis edition, vol.VII, 
1372-1445), of which three sheets were printed before the departure 
for Worms and were dedicated and sent to Duke Johann Friedrich; 
the "Antwort auf das Ubergeistliche Buch Emsers" (St. Louis edition, 
vol. XVIII, 1270-1353) and "Luther's Answer to the Book of Ambrosius 
Catharinus" (St. Louis edition, vol. XVIII, 1434-1583). Luther wrote 
and completed this last so extensive writing between March 7 
(because only shortly before this day this book of Catharinus had 
come to him through Link [De Wette, vol. 1, 570)) and April 1, where 
it went out, printed ready, with his letter to Wenceslaus Link. 


doubtful the priority of the first German edition and 
the first edition of the second German edition over 
the Latin. 

The first German edition of the Passionals "is 
completely facsimilirt in 'Deutsche Drucke dlterer Zeit 
in Nachbildungen' herausgegeben von D. Wilh. 
Scherer Ill. Berlin, Grote. 1885." (Weim. Ausgabe, 
Vol. IX, p. 690.) The same is provided with an 
introduction by G. Kawerau. Another reprint was 
published in 1874 by Robert Hoffmann in Leipzig with 
the letter of Pope Pius IX and the reply of Emperor 
Wilhelm. This Leipzig reprint "with pictures by Lucas 
Cranach the Elder" appeared "reissued and endorsed 
by C. F. W. Walther, St. Louis, Mo. 1878," at the 
printing house of the Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and 
other states (now Concordia Publishing House). 

Numerous are the "imitations" of the Passionals. 
In 1557 and again in 1558, an Antithesis de 
praeclaris Christi et indignis Papae facinoribus 
was published in Geneva under the name of the 
printer Zacharias Durant, in which 18 antitheses are 
found in 36 woodcuts, of which 25 are copies or 
imitations of Cranach's, r68p. of the additions in the 
Strasbourg edition. Under a different title, Eustathius 
Vignon at Geneva published a Latin edition in 1578, 
whose images are printed from the same stock as 
those in the two previous editions. In the same year 
he also published a French translation: Antithese 
des faicts de Jesus Christ et du pape etc.. The 
same was reprinted in 1584, likewise in 1600 with the 
caption: Imprimi a Rome Pan du grand jubila, 
M. DC. The Weimar edition also gives the titles of 
two German imitations, as well as an Italian and a 
Spanish translation. Sepp, Verboden Lectuur, p. 
126, also lists a Dutch one. 

The Passional was imitated in a different way in 
the church of Wilhelmsburg Castle in Schmalkalden. 
There, in 1587, Landgrave Wilhelm had the painter 
Georg Krachard depict twenty antitheses between 
Christ and the Pope in 40 pictures on the parapets of 
the galleries and on the west wall. Each pair of 
pictures is accompanied by a biblical passage or a 
quotation from the Decretals, and, as in the 
Strasbourg edition, by a Latin hexameter and a 
German rhyme. For this, the verses of the 
aforementioned edition are obviously used. In 1608, 
the pictures were removed from the chapel and 
moved to the castle in Rotenburg.

brought. In 1641, Duke Ernst the Pious received 
them as a gift and gave them a place in the library 
on Friedenstein near Gotha. In 1701, B. G. Struve 
had described the pictures and published their Latin 
and German inscriptions; also E. Sal. Cyprian had 
them still 1718 before eyes and communicated a part 
of the inscriptions. Since then the pictures have 
disappeared. The verses have also been preserved in 
the acts of the Marburg State Archives. 

In the collections have our writing with pictures: 
Die Eislebensche, Vol. I, Bl. 44. The images are 
mostly printed from the original woodblocks, only 
images 7 and 17 are mirror reproductions. Image 11, 
like the second Wittenberg German and Latin 
editions, shows the Carrying of the Cross. The 
epilogue is missing, but Aurifaber has included the 
contents of the same in his introduction. The 
Altenburger, vol. I, p. 579, has mirror reproductions 
that are rather poorly executed according to the 
Eisleben edition. The Weimar edition brings vol. IX, 
p. 701 ff. the reprint of the text according to the first 
German Wittenberg edition, and as a supplement at 
the end of the volume a complete facsimile of the 
title 





sheet, the images and the epilogue of this edition, 
also the replacement image of the second Wittenberg 
edition. Without the pictures, the signatures are 
found in the Leipzig edition, vol. XXII, appendix, p. 
76, by Walch and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 63, p. 
241. We reproduce the text according to the Weimar 
edition, the pictures from the plates of Walther's 
single edition, which are cut after the pictures of the 
first Wittenberg edition. Similarly, we have placed the 
German verses of the Strasbourg edition 1) above 
the images, and the cited passages of canon law (in 
parentheses) are shown according to part and page 
of the Céln edition of 1717 recognized by the Pontiffs. 


1) The first Latin hexameter of the Strasbourg edition is rendered 
thus in the Weimar edition: 
Eegna fugit Christus Presulque [Papa imperat orbi.] with 
the note: "The bracketed is missing, but is so added in handwriting in 
the copy formerly belonging to D. Knaake." If one scans, one can 
easily convince oneself that the word is too much. It also does not 
belong in the verse, but is only a gloss that the scribe has made 
praesul; in the verse it is to be deleted.

The kingdom of Antichrist is entirely external. What does the pope's law say otherwise than the order of

5, Preface to a collection of small writings by Joh. Wessels from 
Groningen. *) 


1522. 


Greetings to the Christian reader GOtt! 
The prophet Elijah the Thisbite once thought, when 
the word of the Lord was precious and there was little 


| have always wished that | too would be taken away from 
the midst of my Baalites and live civilly dead in a corner 
for myself, completely despairing that | could accomplish 


prophecy [1 Sam. 3, 1], and almost all prophets were 
inactive for fear of the exceedingly godless Jezebel, that 
he alone was left [1 Kings 19, 11]. Therefore he was 
weary of life and desired that his soul be taken from him 
[1 Kings 19:4], because he thought that he alone would 
not be able to bear the infallible burden of the 
exceedingly godless people and the princes of it, and 
did not yet know that seven thousand were left to the 
Lord [1 Kings 19:18], and that Obadiah had been 
preserved with a hundred hidden prophets [1 Kings 18:3 
ff]. This seems to me, if small things may be compared 
with great, to have a likeness with this time of mine. For 
| do not know by what providence of God I, carried away 
into the public, have fought with these monsters of 
indulgences and the papal laws and the falsely famous 
theology (1 Tim. 6, 20.) in such a way that | thought | 
was alone. Although | have always had courage enough, 
so that | am now and then accused of being too biting 
and ruthless, because of the too 


anything with these godless iron foreheads and iron 
necks. But behold, it is also said to me that the Lord's 
remnant celebrates unharmed even at this time, and that 
the prophets have been preserved in secret; and this is 
not only said, but also made known with joy. For Wessel 
(called Basil), a Frisian from Gréningen, has come forth, 
a man of admirable gifts, of a rare and great spirit, in 
whom it is also seen that he is in truth taught of God, as 
Isaiah [Cap. 54, 13] prophesied that the Christians would 
be. For it cannot be supposed that he received it from 
men, any more than | did. If | had read this before, it could 
have been regarded by my enemies as if Luther had 
drawn everything from Wessel; so much does our two 
minds agree. But this increases my joy and my strength, 
and now | have doubts. 





*) "Some friends of the Reformation in the Netherlands, among whom especially the jurist Cornelius van Hon (Hoen) or Honius is to be 
mentioned, sent to Luther in the summer of 1522 through the theologian Rode or Rodius, Rector of the Brothers of Common Life in Utrecht, 
a collection of small writings by the pious and learned theologian Johann Wessel (died 1489). It was put into print and Luther wrote a preface 
to it." (Késtlin, Martin Luther (3), Vol. |, p. 680.) Aurifaber brings this preface into his Latin collection of letters, tom. Il, toi. 89, under this 
heading: Praefatio D. M. Lutheri in Farraginem rerum Theologicarum Vuesseli Groningensis viri doctissimi Anno M.D.XxXIl.

is made there to Schitze, "Ungedr. Briefe Luthers," D. Ill, p. 297. Walch claims in the preface to the 14th volume, p. 22, that our preface 
actually belongs only to the collection of his letters, but not to the karrnFO rornrn tkeoloKieurnin, which appeared at Wittenberg in 1522 in 
quarto, to which Joh. Arnoldus Bergellanus had prepared the preface. For this, he refers to the "innocent news 1707", p. 213. However, it 
seems to us from the content of the preface that it refers not only to letters, but also to other theological doctrinal writings, thus Aurifaber is in 
the right with his statement. Our preface is found in German in the Eisleben edition, vol. |, p. 109; then in the Altenburg edition, vol. Il, p. 206; 
in the Leipzig edition, vol. XXII, appendix, p. 79, and in Walch. We have replaced the old translation (probably by Aurifaber) by a new one, 
according to Aurifaber's Latin collection of letters.

| do not doubt that | have taught correctly, since he 
agrees with me in all things in such a constant sense 
and almost in the same words, yet at different times, in 
a foreign sky and country, and under different 
circumstances. | wonder, however, what misfortune has 
prevented this extremely Christian writer from reaching 
the public; it may have been the cause that he lived 
without war and bloodshed, in which alone he is unlike 
me. Or it might have been the fear of our Jews who, with 
their godless inquisitions, seem to be born to turn all 
extremely good books into heretical ones, while they 
impose their Aristotle and their more than heretical 
books on us as Christian ones. Now these from God's 
judgment take an end with disgrace. Therefore, a godly 
reader may read, and read with good judgment, that in 
which this man excels, and which he also expresses in 
an excellent manner. And those who take offense at me 
because of excessive sharpness, at others because of 
the "excessive" subtlety of expression, 1) have nothing 
to complain about here. His way of writing is a generally 


passable one (frivialis), and for his time, the matter 


itself is treated in an appropriate and proficient manner. 
And 


1) The previous passage is given by the old translator: "andern 
auch nicht gefallet, dass ich so reine, gute Worte braucht". In Latin it

Since Virgil was able to extract gold from the dung of 
Ennin, a theologian will also be able to extract something 
from our Wessel, which he can add to the treasures of 
his eloquence. May the Lord Jesus give us many other 
people like this Basil. Farewell, dear brother in Christ. 
Wittenberg, July 30 [1522].

[October 4]. He is buried in Groningen in the 


monastery called the Spiritualium Virginum. 
Divination M. Wessels. 


M. Johannes Ostendorpius, canon of the church of 
St. Levinus in Deventer, a man who was very learned

when he was still a youth, to the old Wessel the 


Frisian (who was commonly called lux mundi), and 
heard from him, among others, as if he already saw 
before his eyes what would happen, also this: My 
young student, you will live to see the time when the 
teaching of these newer and _  quarrelsome 
theologians, Thomas, Vonaventura and others of the 
same ilk, will be rejected by all truly Christian 
theologians. Noviomagus heard this from the already 
aging Ostendorpius in the church of St. Levinus in 
1520 on April 22.

St. Franciscus, 1) they say, brought this man to ruin for 
no other reason than that he wanted a purifier for the 
Roman cesspool. And at that time that Antichrist dared 
to hope that the memory of this great man would be 
destroyed, even under the curse, but behold, he lives 
and his memory is blessed. Christ canonizes him (as 
they say) through us, even if the pope and the papists 
burst with him over it. 

Then you will also perceive in these interpretations how 
works have no honor at all before God, and how 
necessary in judgment and in death the sole and firm 
faith in the mercy of God is, without all works (on which 
one can rely), since you see here how even faith itself 
struggles and can hardly prevail through the word of 
God, - so much is lacking in it that you cannot see the 


You could have confidence that the works here are able 
to do something. And even though the dung of human 
theology still hangs on his feet, on which he seems to 
have spent much time uselessly (for who could have 
been completely clean of this filth at that time. 3), he still 
shows you a pure and beautiful example of faith, trust 
and hope in God's mercy, but of mistrust and despair of 
us and our powers, that is, an example of evangelical 
doctrine and Christian godliness. For you do not see him 
walking along trusting in his monastic vows, 2) not in his 
religious rules, his cap, masses, and the works of his 
order, but standing, as ready to practice the gospel of 
peace, clothed with the cancer of righteousness and 
armed with the shield of faith and the helmet of salvation, 
not as of the order of preaching monks, but as of the 


common order of Christians. Be well, and follow him. 


1) "Luther probably means the Franciscan Francis of Puglia, who 
in his Lenten sermons in 1498 in the church of Santa Croce 
denounced Savonarola as a schismatic, heretic and false prophet."

2) vota substantialia are the vows that constitute the essence of

Alexander VI to the stake. During the imprisonment that preceded his death, from April 8 to May 23, 1498, he wrote reflections on the 51st 
Psalm and on the first three verses of the 31st Psalm. The completion was prevented by his death. L. von Ranke, Werke, vol. 40/41, p. 327, 
says: "The writing is like a confession, a religious soliloquy, in which, despite all scholastic and exegetical subtlety, a deep, warm and genuine 
religious feeling prevails" (Weim. Ausg.). Both interpretations soon became popular edification writings and appeared in numerous editions in 
Latin, Italian and German. Still in 1522, the interpretation of the 51st Psalm went out on June 30 and that of the 31st Psalm on July 4 in 
German, both in the same printing house, but without indication of the place and the printer. In 1523, these two writings appeared in Latin at 
Wittenberg under the title: Meditatio pia et erudita Hieronymi Savonarolae a papa exusti super psalmos Miserere mei et In te 
Domine speravi. V Vittembergae 1523. The printing is by Johann Grunenberg. Luther wrote our preface to this manuscript. Whether he 
himself ordered the reprinting, we do not know. The Weimar edition describes two more reprints, which have the same title, and says of the 
first, which is marked on the title page in the copy with the year "Al.V.XXiIlI.", that it went out in Strasbourg (probably by Joh. Herwagen) only 
in 1524. The second reprint is without place, time and printer. Furthermore, the Weimar edition gives the title of a print that Veit Dietrich 
organized of Luther's interpretation of the 51st and 130th Psalms (cf. our edition vol. V, 472, where we have followed the information of the 
Erlangen edition), which appeared in Strasbourg in 1538, ‘put’ Eratonsm MMura. “n. H).XXXVIII. Llsnss 8spt.", which, together with 
Savonarola's reflection on the 51st Psalm, contains our preface on p. Il 2. In 1524, Nickel Schirlentz in Wittenberg published a German 
translation of the first part of the Llstitutio, namely the interpretation of the 51st Psalm, under the title: "Eyn andechtige vnd kunstreyche 
betrachtung odder ausslegung Hieronimi Sauonarole vom Bapst Verbrand vber den eyn funfftzigisten Psalm, Gott erbarm dich meyn.

1) Friedrich Fischer. 





“Johann Apel, a native of Nuremberg, was Canonicus in Wirzburg under the bishop Conrad von Thingen, and just like his friend 
Friedrich Fischer, he was employed as a councilor from "the bishop's chancellery. Although both were lawyers, as canons they were bound 
to celibacy. At first, Fischer had entered into a secret marriage with a Fraulein from Mainz, and his example was followed by Apel, who 
married a noble nun from the Wurzburg monastery St. Marx "zu rettung seines gewisfens". After some time, both of them were indicated by 
adversaries. The bishop asked Apel to return the nun to her convent, but he refused because she was his wife. In mid-May, when he was 
cited before the bishop, he asked for permission to submit his justification in writing, and then, on the following day, submitted his letter of 
protection. But already on June 1, he and Fischer were arrested at the chancellery and "thrown into the bottom of a deep tower" on 
Frauenberg. The two women, warned in time, saved themselves by escaping. Only after several orders of the imperial regiment, which had 
been caused by repeated supplications of the relatives of both husbands, it finally came to the bishop that on August 26 the prisoners were 
released from their custody, and on September 27 the bishop gave the verdict that they should be deprived of their office and benefice, and 
shortly thereafter they left the monastery. Apel, recommended to the Elector by Lazarus Spengler, went to Wittenberg and took over the 
lectures on canon law given up by Jonas. 

Already earlier Apel had had relations with the Wittenbergers. In 1502 he was one of the first students at the newly opened university. 
Luther, Melanchthon, Jonas, Joh. Lang from Erfurt and others belonged to his friends, and he had an old friendship with Spalatin. Probably 
before his imprisonment, he had sent a copy of his defense to his friend Crotus Nubeanus in Fulda, and the latter had the document sent to 
Luther, who decided to make it known through printing and prefixed a letter to Crotus. It appeared while they were still prisoners under the 
title: vetensio lolunnm pelli ua Lpseopnm Herbiwo1on8om pro 8u0 eoniuZio. Four leaves in quarto. At the end: liuproWunr VVittomvorM: 
1523. Luther's letter begins on the back of the title page. The printer is Johann Grunenberg in Wittenberg. A second edition, which is otherwise 
identical to the first, corrects the printing error on the title page and offers Lpi8eopum; in addition, in several copies there is only a dot after 
VVittooaberM instead of the colon. A reprint was published in Kénigsberg in Prussia in 1524. The whole manuscript is reprinted in "Innocent 
News 1710," p. 199, with Luther's letter; the letter alone in Aurifaber, toro. Il, toi. 141; in De Wette, vol. Il, p. 358; in the Erlanger, opp. vnr.

Edicte of the emperor finally say valet. We will not, of 
course, burn (as they do) or throw into bonds, or do 
anything by force (for that is not proper for Christians), 
but 1) protect the honor of the Word with words and 
writings and chastise the abominations of the papists 
more thoroughly. 

But that you admonish me that | should also punish 
our screamers, because they cause great trouble with 
their uncouth words and customs: their conscience 
certainly gives them testimony that they do not have from 
me what is offensive to you. But, dear Crotus, who 
knows whether Christ, according to his supreme 
counsel, does not want such impetuous evangelists to 
be so nonsensical, not for our sake, to whom they can 
do no harm, but for the sake of the enemies of the Word, 
the bishops and sophists? For until now, although they 
have been asked so often in all humility and modesty, 
they have never wanted to admit those who wanted to 
give an account, 2) but with closed ears and eyes, like 
angry and senseless people, as the gospel could only be 
heard, they condemn and persecute everything, so that 
they are not worthy to see or hear a humble evangelist. 


1) which was forbidden by the imperial edict, as it commanded not 
to have controversial writings printed, 

2) The Weimar edition rightly notes: "de Wette declares this 
passage ‘obviously erroneous' without reason." 





Look at the tyrant Apel with his whoremongers. Are 
they not quite worthy, according to your own judgment, 
that, having despised such a godly and thorough 
defense, and having crucified Christ who speaks wisely, 
they not only like to hear their lies and wickedness, but 
also do not see the saving gospel preached in any other 
way than that they are twice, thrice, seven times, even 
without end, offended and corrupted by it? And that 
those who would not be softened by the wise Christ are 
hardened to the end by the foolish Christ? O how 
incomprehensible are his judgments! 

Therefore, dear Crotus, let us bear the grievances of 
our fellow men, and by prayer seek redress for these 
things from the Lord. Of course, | do not entirely dislike 
the fact that some of us stumble like this (as far as the 
matter itself is concerned). For through this weakness of 
ours it will happen that the adversaries will hope for 
victory and take courage to blasoheme. This hope of 
theirs is our salvation and their destruction, as it is written 
[Ps. 73:18], "Thou overthrowest them when they rise up." 
"Over a little while, so shall he come that is to come, and 
shall not be pardoned" [Heb. 10:37.]. In him prosper. 
Grace be with you, amen. Wittenberg, 1523.

to whom Agrippa von Nettesheim had recommended him, and came to Eisenach in November 1522. (Erlanger Br.-W., Vol. IV, p. 38 f.) From 
there he wrote several letters to Luther, in which he asked him for assistance. Luther repeatedly interceded for him with the Elector through 
Spalatin, who then also gave him support several times, after good testimonies about his righteousness had arrived from abroad, and Luther 
himself had gotten to know him personally and had spoken favorably about him. From Eisenach, Lambert had gone to Wittenberg (against 
Luther's wishes), and we find him there on January 22, 1523 (Erlanger Br.-W., Vol. IV, p. 65), expecting to earn his keep as a lector at the 
high school. But on August 3, Luther wrote to Spalatin (Erl. Br.-W., vol. IV, p. 200) that Lambert was complaining about the ingratitude of his 
audience, who paid him nothing. He read about Hosea in front of a large audience, about the Gospel of Luke and about the Song of Songs. 
In a letter to the Elector on November 2, he wrote that he had been interpreting Lucas for six months and had received only fifteen groschen 
from all his listeners together. As early as mid-August 1523, he was therefore considering leaving Wittenberg for Zurich, hoping to make a 
better living in the vicinity of France. But his departure was delayed. On December 4, Luther wrote for his sake to Nie. Gerbe! in Strasbourg 
to get him a position there, but, as it seems, in vain. It was not until mid-February 1524 that he left Wittenberg for Metz, where he had been 
called to preach. But already after eight days he had to give way before the papal clergy, and then turned to Strasbourg, where he remained 
until October 1526. In 1527 he came to the newly established University of Marburg. His straitened circumstances, however, had not prevented 
him from marrying a maid servant in Wittenberg as early as July 13, 1523. (Cf. Luther's letter to Spalatin of June 24, 1523, Erl. Br.-W., vol. IV, 
p. 168 f.) The booklet to which Luther has written our preface seems to have been begun not long after his first arrival in Wittenberg, for his 
preface is dated: IVittsrabsrMs Msnss Martio 1523. It appeared under the title: Christianissimi Doc. Martini Lutheri, et Annemundi 
Cocti Equitis Galli, pro sequentibus commentariis Epistolae: Evangelici in Minoritarum Eegulam Commentarii, Quibus

capite est, multarum sectarum perditionis Catalogum invenies. Francisco Lamberto Gallo Theologo authore. 62 octavo leaves. 
Without place and year. In 1524, a German translation appeared under the title: "Inhalt. Des aller Christelichsten Doctor Martin Luthers vund 
Annemund Cocti des Adels vB Gallia zwen Sendbrieff zi lob diesem volgenden bichlin. - A Gospel description of the Barefoot Rule, which 
reveals not only what is to be kept from its rules, but also from other Munich rules and statutes. Therein also many sects of corruption are 
described. - By the godly Franciscum Lamprecht of Gallia. M.D.xxiiij." 40 quarto leaves. At the end: "In the year M.D.xxiiij. Am achten tag des 
Mertzen." We assume that this edition was published in Strasbourg, and that the clumsy, un-German, and in part also erroneous translation 
may have been made by the author himself during the first period of his stay in Strasbourg. Walch, Vorrede zum 14. Bande, p. 23, also 
mentions an octavo edition published in Strasbourg in 1525, which the author himself must have produced. - Seidemann places [De Wette, 
Vol. VI, p. 41), because Lambert's preface is dated March, also Luther's preface in the same time. But since Coctus' letter already mentions 
the burning of the two martyrs in Brussels on July |, 1523, this letter cannot have been written before the end of July. Likewise, Luther's preface 
was not written until the beginning of the printing. The same is found in Latin in Aurifaber's collection of letters, tom. Il, tot. 228 5; in De Wette, 
vol. VI, p. 41 and in the Erlanger, opp. var. aiL., tova. VII, p. 499. German in Walch and in the Erlanger Ausgabe, vol. 63, p. 248, in the above- 
mentioned translation (which is certainly not by Luther, therefore should not have been included in the Erlanger Ausgabe); in a translation 
made by Greifs in the Leipziger Ausgabe, vol. XXII, appendix, p. 81. We have retranslated according to Seidemann - De Wette.

1524. 


Luther wrote this preface to the Waltherschen 
Chorgesangbichlein, which was a joint work of Luther 
and the cantor at the court of Frederick the Wise, Johann 
Walther, and was published in Wittenberg in 1524. The 
title of the only known original copy, which contains only 
the tenor and bass parts, reads: "Geystliche gesangk 


Buchleyn. Tenor. Wittemberg. M.D.xxiiij. Five parts, 
according to the five voices, tenor, discantus, altus, 


bassus and vaganS (second tenor). Bassus.

Our preface is found in the Wittenberg edition (1569), 
vol. IX, p. 553; in the Jena edition (1562), vol. VIII, p. 
356; in the Eisleben edition, vol. |, p. 186; in the

vol. XXII, appendix, p. 82; in the old Walch edition twice, 
namely here and vol. X, 1722 and in the Erlanger, vol. 
56, p. 296. Since this preface is already included in the 
tenth volume of the St. Louis edition, Col. 1422, we omit 
it here. In the heading there (as correctly in the preface 
to vol. X, Col. 115, § 44), the year 1524 should be set 
instead of 1525. 


Luther's answer to Otto Braunfels, who had given him writings by John 
Hus, *) 


October 17, 1524. 


To his dearest brother in the Lord, Otto Brunfels, the 

servant of Christ. 

Grace and peace in Christ. It is nothing that you 
suspect, dear Otto, that | do not recognize your 
willingness to serve and your affection for me. | certainly 
acknowledge them, but | am too small for such esteem 
and not worthy of it. | am glad that John Hus, a true 
martyr of Christ, will come to light in our time, that is, will 
be properly canonized, even if the papists should burst. 
Would God that my name were worthy, that such a man 
would be dedicated to him and go out under him. 





Only | wanted them to refrain from praising me. 
Otherwise, by God's grace, through the long habit of 
hearing curses, | have now come so far that it makes no 
difference to me in this life whether | am blessed or 
cursed. Therefore, prepare yourself, and also bring to 
light what is left, so that he may be completely 
canonized. | have nothing to say against it. | ask only 
one thing of you, that you command me, a wretched 
man, to Christ in your prayer. In him you are quite well. | 
have not been able to write more, | have so many things 
to do. Farewell and greet all of us. October 17, 1524.

11. preface to Johann Lichtenberger's prophecy, *) , 


1527. 


1. Because this book of Johannis Lichtenberger with 
its prophecies is not only widely used, both in Latin and 
German, but is also held in high esteem by many, and is 
also despised by some, but especially the clergy are now 
highly consoling and rejoicing about it, after an almost 
mean speech has arisen from this book, that it would one 
day pass over the clergy, and after that it would be good 
again, and think that it has now happened, that they are 
through, that their persecution by the peasants’ revolt 
and Luther's teaching is meant by this Lichtenberger. 
For the sake of all this, | am moved, with this preface, to 
leave out one more thing about the same Lichtenberger, 
to give my verdict on it, for the instruction of all who 
desire it, except the clergy, whom | forbid, along with 
their followers, that they believe nothing of me, for those 
who are to believe me will find themselves well without 
them. 

First, there are some prophets who prophesy from 
the Holy Spirit alone, as Zechariah 7:12 says: "The 
words that the LORD of hosts sent by his Spirit in the 
prophets," as Peter also testifies, 2 Pet. 1:20 f.: "The 
prophecy of the Scriptures does not come from their own 
interpretation, for no prophecy has ever come forth from 
the will of man, but the holy people of God have spoken, 
driven by the Holy Spirit. This prophecy is directed and 
aimed at the punishment of the wicked and the salvation 
of the pious, and it always urges faith in God, and to 
secure and build up consciences, and when there is 
distress and affliction, or when it is to come, it comforts 
the pious. And it also deals with the pious alone; it has 
nothing to do with the wicked. 


It does not comfort them or promise them, but it does 
threaten them and punish them. 

Against this prophecy Satan also has his prophecy, 
that is the false prophets, sects and heretics, by which 
he corrupts the faith in God, destroys and seduces the 
consciences, comforts with lies, threatens with 
falsehood, and thus fights without ceasing against the 
pure prophecy and teaching of God. 

4 The Lichtenberger is not of this kind, for he does not 
claim fame or appeal to the Holy Spirit, as the true and 
false prophets do, but bases his prophecy on the course 
of the heavens and the natural arts of the celestial bodies 
with their influences and effects. He neither teaches nor 
seduces, neither comforts nor punishes, but speaks 
badly of future things, whether they affect the godless or 
the pious, 1) as his art in the stars gives him. He also 
speaks of the true Christian church, but not otherwise 
than as it stands outwardly in bodily possessions and 
goods and dominions, nothing at all as it stands in the 
faith and comfort of the Holy Spirit; that is, he speaks 
nothing of the true Christian church, but as the same 
stellar art is wont to speak of all other heathen dominions 
and kingdoms. Therefore he also remembers the 
Hussites as enemies of the church, and the family of 
Dan, from whom the end-Christ should come. And his 
reformation stands in cutting the long hair, cutting off the 
beaks on the shoes, and burning board games; these are 
his Christians, so that [it] is even a bodily prophecy, of 
vain bodily things. 


1) In the original: godless or pious. 





*The prophecies of the astronomer Johann Lichtenberger, who 





ived in the second half of the fifteenth century, were widely read and 


repeatedly reprinted. When Stephan Roth published this book again in 1527, Luther wrote a preface to it. The title was: "Die weissagunge 
Johannis Lichtenbergers deudsch, zugericht mit vieys. Sampt einer nitzlichen Vorrede vnd Unterricht D. Martini Luthers, Wie man die selbige 
vnd der gleiche weissagunge verneinen sol. Wittemberg. M.D.xxvij." In quarto. At the end: "Printed in Wittemberg by Hans Lufft. M.D.xxvij." 
The preface is found in the Wittenberg edition (1569), vol. IX, p. 537p; in the Jena edition (1556), vol. Ill, p. 438; in the Altenburg edition, vol. 
lll, p. 777; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XXII, appendix, p. 83; and in the Erlanger edition, vol. 63, p. 250. We give the text according to the 


Erlanger, comparing the Wittenberg and Jena editions.

5 His prophecy is not a spiritual revelation, for this is 
done without the art of the stars, and is also not subject 
to the art of the stars, but it is a pagan, ancient art, which 
was almost splendid and common with the Romans, and 
also before that with the Chaldeans; but they could not 
tell the king of Babylon his dreams, nor interpret them, 
Daniel must do it through the spirit; so the Romans were 
also often lacking. Therefore, it is to be seen whether this 
art is also able and able to hit something, because | 
myself do not know this Lichtenberger to despise in all 
places, has also hit some things, especially with the 
images and figures close to it, almost more than with the 
words. 

6) Here it is to be noted that God, who alone made 
everything, also governs everything Himself, also alone 
knows and can say future things, has nevertheless taken 
to Himself both His angels and us humans, through 
whom He wants to govern, so that we work with Him and 
He with us. 1) For though he could govern, nourish, and 
protect wife and child, house and farm, without us, yet he 
will do it through us, and appointeth the father or ruler of 
the house, saying, Be obedient to father and mother; and 
to the father, Teach and instruct thy children. Item, so 
could he also without kings, princes, lords and judges 
rule worldly, Keep peace, and punish the wicked; but he 
does not want, but hands out the sword, and says: 
Punish the wicked, protect the pious, and keep the 
peace. Although he does it himself through us, and we 
are only his shell, under which he hides himself, and 
works everything in everyone, as we Christians well 
know. Just as he himself does everything in the spiritual 
government of his Christians, teaches, comforts, 
punishes, and yet outwardly commands the apostles to 
do the word, office and ministry. Thus he needs us men, 
both in physical and spiritual government, to rule the 
world and all that is in it. 

(7) In the same way he has need of angels, though we 
do not know how this is done; for he does not command 
them the sword, as the temporal authorities do, nor the 
outward word, as the preachers do, nor the bread and 
wine. 

1) Thus the Wittenberg. Jenaer and Erlanger: act. 





Clothes, cattle, and house, as to the keepers of the 
house, and parents. For we neither see nor hear of the 
angels, as we see and hear of men; yet the Scripture 
says in many places that he rules the world through the 
angels, assigning to every emperor, king, prince, lord, 
even to every man his angel, who does his best with him, 
and promotes him in his rule and reign, as Dan. 10, 13. 
20. the angel of the Jews complains that the angel of 
Persia has resisted him, but the angel of the Greeks 
comes to his aid. 

8. But how the dear angels remain one before God, 
and yet are against each other before men, just as the 
kings, commanded to them, are against each other, | 
leave here this time for the sake of the full spirits, who 
can learn in a moment all that Christ and all the 
necessary articles of faith require, and then fall to 
questions, worrying about what God did before the world, 
and the like, so that they also have to atone for their 
presumption with the dear angels here, but want to do 
the very easiest, which they also understand deliciously 
well as soon as they hear it. 

9. Namely, because God rules the wicked in worldly 
authority through Himself and His angels (as has been 
said), mostly for the sake of His word, so that it may be 
preached, which could not happen unless there were 
peace in the land: So he also takes them seriously, and 
sometimes lets them secure and have happiness 
through his angels, sometimes also miraculously escape 
from misfortune, as all pagans themselves confess that 
strife and victory stand badly not in man's power nor wit, 
but in happiness. This happens when the dear angels 
are there, and by internal stimulation suddenly give 
advice or a meaning, or outwardly place a sign and 
impulse in the way, so that man is warned or turned to 
do this, to leave that, to go this way, to avoid that, even 
often against the first intention. 

010 For because they speak not unto us in words, 
they enter into it with their mind, or 


2) Thus the Wittenbergers. Jenaer: fordere; Erlanger: forder. 


270 Erl. 63, 255-LS7. 
external cause, just as we yell at horses and oxen, or put 
wood and stone in the way, so that they do not fall into 
the ditch. Such outward signs or causes are called omina 
by the pagans, that is, evil indications or warnings, of 
which their books are full, for they see it happening, but 
they do not know who is doing it, of which much would 
have to be written and examples given. 

11 The angels do this on earth. Above this, God in 
heaven also performs his signs when misfortune strikes, 
and causes stars to appear in the tail, or the sun and 
moon to lose their light, or otherwise appear in an 
unusual form. Item, on earth horrible miracles are born, 
both in humans and animals, which all the angels do not 
make, but God himself alone. With such signs, He 
forewarns the wicked and indicates future calamities over 
lords and countries to warn them. For the sake of the 
pious, such things do not happen, because they are not 
allowed to, therefore they are also told not to be afraid of 
the signs of heaven, as Jeremiah says Cap. 10, 2. For it 
does not apply to them, but to the wicked. 

(12) This is the origin of astrology and divination. 
Because it is true that such things happen, and 
experience proves that they mean bad luck or good luck, 
they went to the stars and wanted to grasp it and make al 
certain art out of it. Then they went up to heaven and 
wrote it in the stars, and because they had his thoughts, 
so that it rhymes with the stars, now the stars and nature 
must do it, which God and the angels do; just as the 
heretics first find their thoughts, then carry them into 
writing, and must then call writing what they dream. Then 
the devil struck, mixed himself in, and as he is a lord of 
the world against God's rule, he has also caused many 


similar signs on earth, which they call OMINa, and has 
awakened soothsayers in some places, as in Delphis and 
Hammon, who have interpreted such signs and have told 
future things. 

(13) Now that he is the prince of the world, and has 
before him all ungodly kings and rulers, with their] 
countries, minds, and beings, and has seen all the 
experience from the beginning of the world

271 


he can easily see where it wants to go with them. But 
because he is not sure (for God often breaks his armor 
and does not always let him hit), he gives out his 
prophecies with such wavering words that, if it happens 
or not, he is nevertheless true. As when the king asks 
Pyrrhus whether he would strike the Romans? he 


answers: Dico Pyrrhum Romanos vincere posse; as 
when | speak in German: Ich sage Hansen Petern 
schlagen; es schlagt nun Hans oder Peter, so is it both 
understood by the words. And he has done many such 
things by God's decree, and still does them, and often 
happens that [it] happens. But God does not allow it to 
happen all the time, so art is uncertain and makes do with 
it; if it fails in one place, it happens in another; if it does 
not happen in this place, it happens in that one. 

14 What do we say to Lichtenberg and the like? This is 
what | say: First, | consider the reason for his star art to 
be right, but the art uncertain, that is, the signs in the 
heavens and on earth are certainly not lacking, they are 
God's and the angels' work, warn and warn the godless 
lords and countries, also mean something; but to make 
art on it is nothing, and to capture such in the stars. On 
the other hand, it may well be beside the point that God 
or his angel moved him to write many pieces that apply 
equally, even though he thinks the stars give it to him; but 
nevertheless, in order that God might think that art is 
uncertain, he has let him miss it several times. 

15 And the summa summarum of it is: Christians shall 
not ask for such prophecy, because they have 
surrendered themselves to God, and are not allowed to 
have such prophecies and warnings. But because the 
Lichtenberger shows the signs of heaven, the godless 
lords and countries should be afraid of all such 
prophecies, and not think otherwise, for it is meant for 
them, not for the sake of their art, which can and must 
often be lacking, but for the sake of the signs and 
warnings that come from God and angels, on which they 
want to base their art, for these are not lacking, they 
should be sure of that. In our time we have seen many 
suns, rainbows and the like in the sky. Here there is no 
starry

There is no one who could certainly have said that it was 
for this or that king; nevertheless, we see what certainly 
happened to the king of France, Denmark, Hungern, and 
will certainly happen to other kings and princes as well. 
16 Therefore | give the Lichtenberger and the like to the 
great men and countries, that they may know that it is for 
them; and where he meets, that this is done from the 
signs and warnings of God, on which he is based, as 
they certainly apply to the great men, or by the decree of 
God from Satan's input. But where he is mistaken, it is 
because of his art and Satan's temptation; for God's 
signs and the angels' warnings are mixed with Satan's 
suggestions and signs, just as the world is worthy of 
being desolate among itself, and nothing can be 
discerned differently. Let this be my judgment and 
teaching, the Christians ver 





| stand by my choice, that [it] is so right. What the others 
believe is of no concern to me, for they must learn how 
to listen to the pistons of fools. 

(17) Now that my ungracious lords, the clergy, rejoice 
as if they had passed over, and that they should be well 
henceforth, | wish them happiness; they may well do so. 
But because they do not improve their ungodly doctrine 
and life, but also strengthen and increase it, | have also 
prophesied that when it comes about a little while that 
such their joy will be put to shame, | will ask very kindly 
that they remember me, and confess that Luther has 
done better than both the Lichtenbergers and their own 
thoughts. If not, | hereby earnestly command them that 
they must confess it without their thanks, and have all 
the misfortune to do so. For this, God keep them, as far 
as they convert. God grant His mercy, amen.

1527. 


Martinus Luther to all dear lords and friends in 
Christo. 

Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord 
Jesus Christ! Gentlemen, the end is near, for until now 
we, who lived under the papacy, have committed such 
sins that might have been forgiven, namely those that 
we did not recognize because of blindness, error and 
darkness; which sin is not only forgiven by God's 
unspeakable grace, but for which we have also received 
the riches of grace from God. 





Light of Christian truth given, abundantly and publicly 
presented before all the world, and not cast under a 
bushel; so that no one can excuse himself for ignorance. 


Now consider another sin, which unfortunately will 
give us the last one, that is, the sin in the Holy Spirit, 
which cannot be forgiven, but brings with it the two last 
calamities, that is, deprivation of the truth in the Spirit, so 
that God's Word is abandoned, and after that bodily 
disturbance in

wantonly 1) against the publicly recognized truth, there 
is no more help nor advice. Therefore, to warn all who

13. preface about brother Clausen's face in Switzerland), 


1528. 


Martinus Luther to the worthy Doctor Paulo Sperato, 

preacher at K6nigsberg in Prussia. 

1. grace and peace in Christ. We have received the 
face of Brother Clausen in Switzerland, sent to us by you: 
and although | also saw and read it in Carolo Bovillo 
some years ago, nothing moved me then but the one 
who had nothing to do with the Pope. 

But now the sight goes to my heart, because | have 
become funny by pranks to think about the things. Truly 
Christ gives many signs to the papacy, but they have 
gained a forehead of brass and a neck of iron [Isa. 48, 
4], that they turn not to them all, that they may perish and 
perish without all grace. 

You have certainly seen the booklet that went out at 
Nuremberg with the figures, in which the papacy is not 
forgotten. It has come to an end with the final Christ, and 
Christ will put an end to it. God be praised forever and 
ever, amen. 


4) Erlanger: ehrene. 





Accordingly, we are sending the brother Clausen to 
you again, so that you may gather him together with the 
others, who are also fellow witnesses of Christ against 
the final Christ. God's grace be with you, amen. 


To the honorable and wise Thoma Saghem 
Paulus Speratus wishes his greeting. 


1. Although no one will henceforth consider the deceit 
of the Roman beast (which has now been sufficiently 
revealed) so often again to be useful, especially in the 
time in which, due to our ingratitude, so many new and 
harmful evils arise one after the other, which we, 
however, in the power of Christ, mean to resist: But what 
harm is there, as you most strongly urge, since in our 
time we are now thought to be prudent alone to bring to 
light the testimony of some of the ancients, so that by 
their previous opinion ours, which has followed, may be 
confirmed among the weak. For those who are strong, 
neither new nor old, without the word of God, praise 





*) "Luther, together with Speratus, published in 1528 a vision of the pious Swiss hermit Nicolaus von der Fluhe, who died in 1488, 
previously published by the writer Bovillus (Charles de Bouelles, 1508), with illustration and his own interpretation" (Késtlin, Martin Luther (3), 
vol. Il, p. 150). The title of this writing is: "Eine gesichte Bruder Clausen in Schweytz vund seine Bedewtunge." Then follows a woodcut: a needle, 
in the middle of which is a man's head with a triple crown; the spokes of the wheel are six swords without handles; three of them have their

or rebuke, but believe the word alone, without and 
against all things. 

2. Therefore, after the 1) Apocalypsi, which we 
obtained through your help from Lithuania, the face of 
Brother Niclausen also went out in Switzerland, which 
we came across approximately as soon as we opened 
the book (which Carolus Bovillus wrote), since we were 
with Brismann, who sent himself on his way from there 
to Liefland, where, as you know, he was required by two 
letters from Riga, chosen by everyone with great 
eagerness as their future preacher, but whom we have 
lost here (which | testify with all the blessed) with great 
sorrow of heart. Farewell, dear Saghem, remember also 
your prayer to God. Given at the castle of the city of 
K6nigsberg in Prussia, on the 4th day of Januarii An. 
1528. 


Carolus Bovillus sends his greetings to Nicolao 
Horio, elected bishop of Rems in France. 


1) You write to me, my dear Lord, that you consider it 
2) that nothing has happened for five hundred years that 
would resemble what my writing has told you, namely 
about the two knights of Christ, and what | have seen in 
part and heard in part. | will tell you further about another 
holy and wonderful hermit of our times, who has now 
died in peace at the age of twenty. His name is Claus 
vom Felsen, he was a German by birth and a Helvetian; 
3) the Helvetians, however, are Germans from the upper 
countries, which are now commonly called the Swiss, 
and they are located in the mountains. 

There | traveled through the year of our salvation, 
which was counted 1503. And when | heard about the 
virtues of the deceased hermit, | soon received an 
eagerness to experience such a newly unusual thing. So 
from that time on | went to his wilderness. There | was 
then accommodated by his eldest 


1) In the old editions: "dem" and immediately following: "welchs". 

2) Thus the Wittenbergers and the Jenaers; Erlanger: du artiger 
Mann, du habests. 

3) "Helvetians" set by us instead of "Helwetzer" in the original. 





Son, who showed me his father's garment. The next day 
we went to his father's cell, where his father, because he 
was alive, had stayed for twenty-two years until he died, 
without any natural food or drink. So that he taught us 
mortal men how true is this holy and divine saying [Deut. 
8:3, Matt. 4:4]: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by 
every word that proceedeth by the mouth of God." 

3) The Helvetian or Swiss authorities, both spiritual 
and secular, have often besieged the roads and paths to 
his wilderness, to find out whether someone would 
secretly bring him food. But they found out, when it was 
also true, 4) that the same man, now having become 
something higher than a man, to some extent surpassed 
human nature, and like the angels in this world, when he 
was still clothed with flesh, was not subject to human 
need. He also did miraculous works both in his life and 
after his death, as they say, as | have also read in his 
stories. 

Now | will tell you about a vision that appeared to him 
in the sky one night when the stars were shining and he 
was in prayer and devotion. 

5 He saw a head of a human form, its face terrifying, 
full of wrath and affliction. 

The head wore on a triple or papal crown, and on the 
top appeared a ball, into which a cross was stuck. The 
beard hung below him and was also triple. 

Six swords without hilt were seen coming out of his 
face, but in an absurd way. One sword went up from the 
middle of the forehead, and its broad part touched the 
forehead, but with the tip it pierced the cross, or the ball 
at the top of the crown. 

8) Two other swords went out from the eyes, but kept 
their point in the eyes, only the broader part went down, 
5) but two other swords went out from the eyes. 


4) Erlanger: wars. 
5) Wittenberger and Jenaer: "herdan", which will be so much as: 
hervor. Erlanger: "her then".

both nostrils, yet remained with the width in the nostrils. 

9th The sixth sword had its width at the bottom, but 
let its point go into the mouth. And these six swords were 
all seen alike, one like the other. 

The hermit had such a face painted in his cell, which 
| saw and took into my mind, and thus also painted in my 
memory. 

(11) Since | do not know what this means, although it 
soon made me understand with its terrible face that light 
thunderbolts would not come upon the world, | trust that 
you will perhaps understand what God meant by this and 
comfort me again with your Scriptures, so that | may 
receive a certain understanding of a great thing from 
you. 

But if it would be too much for you, because it is such 
a new and difficult thing, write to me again, as you can, 
so that | may tell you my opinion of such stories in 
writing. Farewell. Given from our Sancuria, on the 
evening of Saint Laurentii [August 9]. Anno 1508. 


Nicolaus Horius gives his greeting to Carola 
Bovillo. 


1 Your letter has been very pleasant and sweet to 
me, which your honorable and good friend has sent to 
me. For herewith you have proven your great love for 
me; where | would have doubted it, you may truly have 
given it up. 1) 

(2) But when you ask me to expose to you the face of 
a peculiar hermit who, after living a holy life in the desert 
for twenty-two years, has ascended to the bright heaven, 
| do not promise you that | will do it in such a way that | 
will open up and bring forth the best and truest meaning 
for you. 

3. for no one can accomplish this, except the same 
greatest Spirit who bestows it. 


before with such a great gift. But | will recently reveal to 
you my opinion that | believe it to be so, 2) one must 
interpret the image, which the blessed man saw in the 
desert, when he was praying, thus: that by the human 
head, crowned with a threefold or papal crown, a 
supreme spiritual prince is meant. 

4) That the face of this chief was not only red, but also 
signified gloom and fierce anger, is sufficient to indicate 
the future abomination of the same. 

What more do you ask? Do you want me to explain 
the other? Listen, the sword, which stood broadly on the 
forehead and raised its point to the holy cross, means 
that the same spiritual prince would be an anti-Christian. 
But the sword, which not only touches the one eye, but 
also blinds it, means the darkness of avarice, that he may 
be blinded. 

The other sword, which stabbed the other eye and 
then blinded it with its point, shows his great unchastity 
and avarice. 

7 Furthermore, the tip of two swords, the wider parts 
of which are stuck in the nostrils and clog them, prove 
that the latter will be such a man, who would not feel and 
have any pleasure in heavenly, fragrant things. For his 
inhuman cruelty, which is signified by the swords, will be 
a hindrance to him. 

8) The last sword, which joined the lips together and 
sewed them together with its point, hit him most of all and 
meant that he would become a lazy prankster who would 
not preach even the word of God to his people. 

9) But this is what the hilt of the sword meant, which 
was taken from it, that in the same way, if one really 
wanted to push such and such a number of swords, 
which had no hilt, out of his brother's face, he would have 
to cut himself into it; thus 4) also the sword must not be 
cut. 


2) Erlanger: hab. 
3) Erlanger: neihet. Wittenberger and Jenaer: "neyet", that is, 


1) The meaning will probably be: would you like to have given me | nahet.

Squires do not punish anyone. Whoever is subject to it 
must be tormented by such 1) terrible and gruesome 
rage. 

(10) His beard was also threefold, long and hard; from 
this it may be presumed that he will be a future cause of 
all evil in which all the people will be defiled. For even 
though he was bound to punish everyone, he often 
allowed people to transgress God's law. 

This is my opinion, which you have desired to know, 
which | also want to send to you out of love and 
friendship, which | bear toward you. Farewell. Given at 
Rems in the city, August 28. 2) Anno 1508. 


Martinus Luther. 


1. this face means, how the papacy should be 
revealed before all the world, what kind of thing it is; 
because by the face everything is known. 

First of all, it is red and angry, because it is a 
tyrannical, murderous, bloody regime, both over body 
and soul, which rules with vain 3) anger and compulsion. 

3. secondly, three sword points go out, one from the 
forehead above, and two on either side of the nose 
below; again, three sword points go in, one from below 
to the mouth, and two to both eyes, three against three 
2c. 

The first point of the sword is the doctrine of men, 
which comes from the head and brain of men and is 
invented as the doctrine of spiritual life and good works, 
which goes against Christ's teaching and the faith in 
Christendom, and disturbs the word of the cross. 

5. the other tip, on the right side of the nose, is the 
spiritual right, that he may judge and govern spiritual 
things, and is a 


1) Erlanger: "such ... Witherichen". The Wittenbergers and the 
Jenaers have our reading. 

2) Thus, the Wittenberg and Jena editions have correctly resolved 
the date of the original: "an der. v. kalend. Septembris" correctly 
resolved. - In the Erlanger, at the end of this paragraph, it still says: 
"B." - The Erlanger also has "RenB" instead of: Rems, i.e. Rheims. 

3) Wittenberg and Jena: all. 


angry, strict law, for the noses mean anger in Scripture, 
Psalm 74:1. 

The third, to the left, is his worldly regiment, since he 
also rules temporally in. Is also wrathful, and both come 
out of his nose, that is, are himself driven into the world 
with wrath and anger, without God's command, just as 
the first comes out of his forehead, that is, from human 
wisdom. 

(7) The other three spies have no beginning or origin, 
but come out of the air into his face, that is, the Spirit, 
which openly thrusts the gospel into his face, so that he 
cannot help it, though he is angry and sore at the sight of 
it. 

The first point from below into his mouth, is the word 
of God, which gives him the lie in his doctrine of men, and 
sets up again the faith against his hypocrisy. 

The point to the right eye is the word that blinds and 
disgraces all its wise and prudent in their spiritual right. 
For the gospel condemns such a regime and spiritual 
splendor of all things. 

The third point, in the left eye, is the same word that 
condemns and punishes his worldly ways and worldly 
rule, because according to the Gospel such things are 
not right and forbidden to the apostles of Christ. 

(11) The fact that he does not have a body means that 
the Christians and the church do not hold with the pope, 
nor do they know him as their head, even though they 
must suffer under him. 

The three holy beards are those who adhere to it in 
the three parts, namely the saints of works, as monks, 
priests, nuns. The scholars, as lawyers, theologians, 
masters. The mighty, as kings, princes, lords. Each part 
has its hair, and makes its pile around its chin. But they 
also do not belong to the Christian churches; they hang 
on their heads alone and do not touch their necks or 
bodies. 

13) The sword points without handles mean 4) that such 
a thing should be done with sayings taken from the 
Scriptures; for the pope performs sayings for himself, so 
they are also performed on him, and almost the same 
sayings in the same form and word as he performs them. 


4) In the editions: "significant".

as these points are almost all the same, except that one 
turns them over from his false mind, proving him to be

14, preface about the booklet of the false beggars Bitberei. *) 


1528. 


Preface Martini Luther. 


This booklet about beggars' truffles was previously 
printed by someone who calls himself Expertum in 


truffis. This is a quite experienced fellow in beggary, 
which this booklet also proves, although he would not 
have called himself so. However, | considered it good 
that such a booklet not only remained in the daytime, but 
also became common almost everywhere, so that one 
could see and learn how the devil reigns so powerfully 
in the world, whether it would help that one would 
become wise and want to beware of him once. Of 
course, such a red-welsh language comes from the 
Jews, because there are many Hebrew words in it, as 
those who understand Hebrew will probably notice. But 
the gloss and right mind to it, the faithful warning of this 
booklet, is of course this, that princes, lords, councils in 
cities, and everyone should be wise, and look at the 
beggars, and know that, where one does not want to 
house poor and meager 





Neighbors shall give and help, as God has commanded, 
that out of the devil's incentive, by God's right judgment, 
one give ten times as much to such lost, desperate boys, 
just as we have done up to now to the monasteries, 
convents, churches, chapels, mendicant monks, when 
we abandoned the right poor. Therefore, every city and 
village should know and know its own poor as recorded 
in the register, so that they may help them. But what 
foreign or alien beggars would suffer, not without briefs 
or testimony. For there is too much abuse among them, 
as this booklet reports. And if any city were to take care 
of its poor in this way, such abuses would soon be 
controlled and prevented. This year | myself have been 
cheated and tempted by such tramps and tongue- 
thrashers, more than | want to confess. Therefore, be 
warned whoever wants to be warned, and do good to his 
neighbor according to Christian love and 
commandment. God help us, amen.

15 Preface to Stephan Klingeheil's booklet on priestly marriage, *) 


1528. 


Preface Martini Luther. 


1 | must boast once, because | have not boasted for 
a long time. People have long cried out for a concilium, 
so that the church would be reformed. | mean, | have 
caused a concilium and made a reformation, so that the 
ears of the papists ring, and the heart wants to burst with 
great malice; for | hold it true that if the pope were to hold 
a common concilium, not so much would be 
accomplished in it. 

First, | have chased the papists into the books, and 
especially into the Scriptures, and have driven the pagan 
Aristotelem and the Summites together with the Sophists 


with their [Magister] Sententiarum from the place, so 
that they neither rule nor teach in the pulpit or in schools 
as they did before, which | respect that no concilium 
would have been able to do. 

3 Secondly, | have quieted the great bustle and fair of 
the seductive indulgence, which no concilium should 
have touched. 

Thirdly, the pilgrimages and the devils of the field 

have almost been put out of the way. So | also hope that 
the monasteries and convents will henceforth become a 
measure, and many other large pieces more, which the 
papists must drive, fall and lie down, so that they do not 
rage and rage so unreasonably; they should also have 
ingratitude, where they would be hostile to me without 
cause, | have honestly deserved it. Praise be to God, 
amen. 
5 Again, by God's grace, | have accomplished so much 
that, praise God, now a boy or girl of fifteen knows more 
in Christian doctrine than all the high schools and 
doctors knew before. For the right catechism has once 
again emerged from the 





| have, by God's grace, 1) brought into good conscience 
and order every man, that he may know how to live, 2) 
and how he may live in his state, and in sum, all the 
estates of the world, and in sum, all the estates of the 
world, | have, by God's grace, 1) brought to good 
conscience and order, that each one may know how he 
should live, 2) and how he should serve God in his 
estate, and no small fruit, peace and virtue has resulted 
among those who have accepted it. None of these have 
ever been taught rightly in a monastery, high school, or 
parish, as is evidenced by their books and sermons. 

(6) Yes, rather they have taught 3) the contradiction, 
so that they have also made counsels out of the 
commandments of Christ, Matt. 5 and 6, and in sum 
have taught vain men's estates and works, suppressed 
the faith, diminished and destroyed worldly authority and 
marital status, and the abominations of much more; 
indeed, to this day they know nothing of true Christian 
and necessary articles or catechism. 

(7) And consider it still certain that if the papists, 
especially those who are now almost blubbering with 
letters, were all pressed into one vat and then melted 
and distilled seven times, there should not be a fourth of 
a tongue brought out of it that could teach such articles 
properly, and not find so much out of all their teaching as 
a servant against his lord, a maid against her wives, and 
so on, in the sight of God.

of: lives.

he is doctor, poet, and master of all art, with their bunch. 

(9) Because | have now chased them into the 
Scriptures, and yet they 2) cannot understand nor act, 
help God, what a wild, desolate clamor and clamor | 
have caused with this. Here one howls about one form 
of the sacrament, there the other one laments against 
the clergy marriage; here one barks about the mass, 
here 3) the other one shrieks about good works; there 
one murmurs about monastic vows, there one hums 
about the holy service. 

10 Summa, it is Luther's Reformation. He has caused 
a strange hunt, and hunted such asses' heads into the 
Scriptures, as if one had brought all kinds of animals into 
an animal garden. 

Here, Doctor Cocles barks like a dog; there, Brand 
von Bern screeches like a fox; the blasphemous 
preacher at Leipzig howls like a wolf; Kunz Doctor 
Wimpina quacks like a grunting sow; and there are so 
many different sounds and cries of vermin among each 
other that | am almost disgusted by my hunt, when | 
realize that nothing helps everywhere that they are 
hunted into the Scriptures. The kind will not leave the 
kind, nor the bird sing differently than its beak has 
grown. They are supposed to be in the Scriptures, and 
yet they cannot deal with it; | would like to have mercy 
on their misery myself. 

| have written so many little books, and not one has 
been found who can give me the right 6) answer. 


1) The words: "against his subjects” are in the Wittenberg and in 
the Jena, but are missing in the Erlangen. 
2) In the editions: the same. 
3) Erlanger: kreiset. _ F . 
4) "Cocles" is Cochlaus. The "Brand von Bern" is v. Mensing. Cf. 
St. Louis edition, vol. XIX, 1346. 
5) "one" is missing in the Erlanger. 
6) "correct" is missing in the Erlanger. 





7) | am not going to answer "the same"; everyone lets it 
stand, and meanwhile teaches me other things, which | 
know well before, namely human commandments, that 
they have made me lazy and safe, and | have to let their 
noise and shouting pass by. 

For this reason, | have allowed myself to omit this 
booklet by the worthy licentiate Stephan Klingebeil, in 
which he writes of the priests' marriage against such 
vermin, not only because it is almost well founded in 
Scripture, but also because it is finely and well equipped 
with the papal laws and the sayings of the fathers, 
whether my vermin and wild hunters would understand 
their own howling and clamoring. 

14 For the world cannot deny that the apostles and 
ancient bishops were married, and many ancient canons 
confirm such marriage. It is well known that St. Cyprian 
(who had more spirit and holiness in one hair than all the 
papists have in their whole life and being) not only 
allowed but also advised even the deacons, who had 
vowed chastity, to marry, so that they would be safe from 
the danger of unchastity. 


15: This is what is written in the spiritual law Distinet. 


27. C. Quidam, that St. Augustine speaks thus: Some 
say that they are adulterers who are free after the vow of 
chastity. But | say that they are hardly sinners who 
separate from one another. From this saying it is easy to 
see what St. Augustine thought about the vow and the 
conjugal life, although after that such a saying had to 
give way to the pope. 

16 Thus says there Pope Martinus, Cap. Diaconus: If 
a deacon wishes to renounce his office, and be free, he 
may do so; and gives such a reason for the answer: For 
(says he) although at the time he was ordained he vowed 
chastity, yet the sacrament of marriage is so powerful 
that such a marriage cannot be divorced, although the 
vow is broken. | think it should be clear from such a text 
that the ancients were more concerned with the marital 
state than with the vow of chastity, and that they did not 
consider the vow of chastity as a vow.

Marriage for the sake of vows (as is happening now), but 
have torn the vows for the sake of marriage. 

17 Yes, the pope knows this well, and does it, for he 
has often taken monks and nuns out of the monastery 
and let them marry, as we read in the histories; so that 
the papists themselves, together with their head, do not 
consider it wrong for clergymen to marry, otherwise the 
pope would not do it; therefore it cannot be their 
seriousness that they rage and rage against it. 

(18) But this they have, that they seek only cause to 
lie against us, and to deceive the common man, though 
they know otherwise; and the end of the song is this, If 
they did it, or permitted it, it would be right; but because 
we do it, and permit it, it is wrong. From this you see how 
they seek the truth and love the right, namely their own 
tyranny, and the prison of the poor conscience. They are 
boys in the skin, and all who knowingly and wantonly 
keep it with them. There you have the reason why they 
strive so nearly against our marriage, namely their 
desperate, malicious will to be brave, and nothing else. 
19 Notice also that they not only blaspheme and 
desecrate the innocent marriages of ours, but also so 
chasteningly silence the most heinous whoremongers 
and public adulterers and wife-stealers and maiden- 
abusers, if they themselves are among themselves, that 





their insolent cries of sin fill heaven and earth. There is 
no Cocles, no fire, not one papist who murmurs against 
it. 

(20) And | am reminded of such impudent boys, as if 
a coarse elf in the middle of the market stood up in front 
of everyone and made his muck, and meanwhile pointed 
to a house, where a child with discipline and secretly 
arranged his misery, and thought thereby to beautify 
himself and to move everyone to laugh at the child. 
Shouldn't such a rascal be put out with dogs, or be 
hunted down with rods? 

(21) My papists also do the same: they make their 
filth in all kinds of unchastity most shameful and 
annoying before all the world, and then point to the 
marriage of the priests, who keep themselves with a wife 
by breeding and in silence; nevertheless, they think that 
they want to cover their abominable filth of whoredom 
and fornication with it. Oh, let them go, the blind leaders 
[Matth. 15, 14]. God's wrath has come upon them to the 
end that they shall see no more. 

(22) We have the Scriptures for us, along with the old 
fathers' sayings, and the laws of the former churches, 
along with the Pope's own custom; there we remain. But 
they have some of the fathers' contradictions, new 
canons and their own will, without all Scripture and the 
word of God, so they may remain; if we are heretics, they 
are even greater heretics. But Christ will be the judge of 
all this, amen.

Captain at Wittenberg, my favorable master and 
good friend. 

1. grace and peace in Christ, together with a strong, 

full understanding of this booklet. 


Strict, firm, dear sir and friend! Although this booklet 
would almost be worthy to go out without my name and 
a few letters, not only because of the fact that [there is] 
in it an artful, finely Christian, useful, comforting 





*The book of Menius, to which this preface is placed, has the title: "An die Hochgeborne Firstin, fratv Sibilla Hertzogin zu Sachsen, 
Oeconomia Christiana, das ist, von Christlicher Haushaltung Justi Menij. With a beautiful pigioce by D. Martini Luther. Wittemberg. M.D.XXIX."

booklet, but also that it is attributed to the laudable, 
highborn princess, our gracious Lady Sibylla, Duchess of 
Saxony 2c., | have also undertaken to besmirch it with 
my name and preface, and with the same to give you a 
copy of it, not only to serve the printers with it, who 
sometimes use my name and testimony to distribute their 
books, some falsely, some honestly, but also for the 
benefit of everyone who desires it and respects my 
testimony, so that he may have this booklet all the better 
and learn more diligently. 

2 Mostly, however, to admonish you quite faithfully with 
it. For methinks the Master, He Just Menius, has well met 
a great part of your heart therein, and painted your need 
(though blindly) fine and even, that | hope God will grant 
grace that you will also once give this booklet an image 
and example, Amen. 

(3) For | think that this booklet must also please our 
adversaries themselves, although they do not want to 
please anything of ours, because nothing of theirs is 
attacked in it, but only the marriage state is praised and 
extolled in a simple and clear way: how much more 
should it please us and ours, who recognize and praise 
God's word and work? Truly, such and such a booklet is 
not only very useful, but also very necessary to read and 
keep, so that many, or almost most of the people, even 
though they consider the marriage state to be right and 
divine, do not consider it necessary or commanded, just 
as virginity is considered to be a right and divine thing, 
but not necessary or commanded. So they go along 
safely, not thinking that God's commandment forces and 
compels them to marry, just as if they were free, and it 
were at their discretion and free will to marry if they want 
to, or never; nevertheless, they remain beside it in 
publicly recognized sinful life, comforting themselves of 
the last hour, in which they want to atone, when they can 
no longer sin, and sin does not leave them, but sin leaves 
them. 





4 To such, | say, this booklet is necessary to have and 
to read, so that they may know how high need and hard 
commandment it is, since God says [Ex. 20:13, 14], 
"Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery," just 
as high need and hard commandment, yes, much higher 
need and harder commandment it is: You shall be 
married, you shall have a wife, you shall have a husband. 
For there is God's word [Gen. 1, 27]: "God created man 
male and female," and said [Cap. 2, 24]: "They shall be 
one body; the man shall leave father and mother, and 
cleave to his wife." Such words of God are not left to our 
free will, like virginity and solitary chastity, but it must and 
should be as they read, "Man and woman were created 
to be one body, and to cleave to one another and to 
remain. Such a commandment must be enforced with 
sermons and such books, and the consciences of single 
persons who are not gifted for solitary chastity must be 
burdened with it, and they must be harassed and 
tormented until they have to go to it, and finally say: If it 
is to be, it must be, and if it cannot be otherwise, then 
God will will it, and be daring. 

(5) Above these are some others, who think that it is 
enough for them to be married or to have a wife, and 
think no further than, If | had a wife, | would have a 
husband; or when they come up, they think of goods and 
honor, how they may become rich, and go up, and inherit 
great goods for their children, and ask nothing of the 
discipline of children. And how now some say: If my son 
learns so much that he wins the penny, he is learned 
enough. And now no one wants to raise children in any 
other way than on jokes and art for food; they think 
nothing else, except that they are free, and are free to 
raise the children as they please; just as if there were no 
God who had commanded them otherwise, but they 
themselves are God and lords over their children. If, 
however, there were a strict, orderly regime in the world, 
and such harmful, wicked people were found that they 
did not want to mend their ways and raise their children 
differently, then the authorities should punish them all, 
both in body and in property.

or chase them out to the world. For such people are the 
most poisonous and harmful people on earth, so that 
neither Turk nor Datier can be so harmful. 

The reason is this: as much as there is in them, they 
do nothing else but that both the spiritual and the secular 
state perish, and both housekeeping and child rearing 
perish, and remain vain wild beasts and swine in the 
world, which are good for nothing but to eat and drink. 
Notice that if one does not breed children for teaching 
and art, but makes vain gluttons 1) and drunkards, who 
seek only food: where will one take pastors, preachers 
and other persons to the word of God, to the church 
office, to pastoral care and worship? Where will kings, 
princes and lords, cities and countries take chancellors, 
councilors, clerks, officials? There is no village so small 
that could do without a scribe; we would all learn to live 
in such a way that we would not have to deal with the 
people in the world with whom art and writing are in use 
and honor; what kind of a desolate, horrible world would 
that become? Both spiritual, worldly, marital and 
domestic status would have to go to the ground, and the 
world would become a pure pigsty. But who will help? 
Who is guilty of such an abomination, because just such 
horrible, harmful, poisonous parents, even if they have 
children, whom they could draw to God's service, and 
draw them only to the service of the womb? Woe upon 
woe, and woe to all the same! 

(7) Such wicked worms or careless parents and 
husbands are highly recommended to read or listen to 
this booklet, so that they may learn what God has given 
them and what they owe God for their children. My dear 
journeyman, if you have a child who is sent to be taught, 
you are not free to raise it as you please, nor are you 
free to do with it as you please, but you must see that 
you owe it to God to promote His two regiments and to 
serve Him in them. God needs a pastor, a preacher, a 
schoolmaster in his spiritual kingdom, and you can give 
him one, but you do not do so: behold, there 


1) In the original print (after Dietz): "freslinge". De Wette und die 
Erlanger (Vol. 54, 119): Freschlinge. 





you rob not one skirt from the poor, but many thousands 
of souls from the kingdom of God, and push them into 
hell, as much as is in you, because you take away the 
person who would be capable of helping such souls. 

(8) Again, if you breed your child to be a minister, you do 
not give a skirt, you do not endow a monastery or a 
church, you do something greater, you give a savior and 
minister who can help many thousands of souls to 
heaven. Why is it that not all of them are saved? 
Nevertheless, some do. How do you know it will be your 
son? Thou art not worthy, with all thy goods, to help one 
hour to such a divine foundation and great service, and 
canst help it all thy life. But now you are doing the 
opposite, not for one hour, but for the rest of your life. 
This means storming and robbing the monasteries, 
convents and churches, so that the storming of the 
rebellious peasants can hardly be counted as an insult 
and a prelude. Tell me, what hell can be deep and hot 
enough for such your harmful wickedness? O, what a 
punishment will come upon us for the sake of such 
iniquity! 

(9) So also, in the worldly government, you can serve 
your lord or city more with child discipline than by 
building him castles and cities and collecting treasures 
from all over the world. For what is the use of all this if 
you do not have learned, wise, pious people? | will 
remain silent as to what temporal benefit and eternal 
reward you have from this in the sight of God and the 
world, that your child is also better nourished with this 
than according to your shameful, 2) harmful, sour 
counsel and conduct. Another time | will admonish you 
with a special booklet, which God gives, against such 
shameful, harmful, damned parents, who are not 
parents, but harmful sows and poisonous animals, who 
eat their own young. Let it now be enough of an 
admonition to read this Christian booklet with diligence 
to every householder who wants to exist blessedly here 
and there before God and the world. To this end, God 
grant His grace, amen.

Preface from Caspar Hubcrinus book: "Vom Zorn und der Gite GOttes. 


‘) 


1529. 


To any devout Christian. 


| have gladly put this booklet into print, and have 
done so before, firstly for the benefit of all who love 
Christian doctrine. Secondly, for the strengthening of all 
pious Christians against many an annoying sect and 
blasphemy, through which the angry Satan violently 
storms against our dear gospel, and would like to tear it 
down. But these fine books of ours, which so honestly 
confess and preach Christ, will remain secure on the 
rock on which they are built. For Christ says in the 
seventh chapter of Matthew: The house that is built ona 
rock is built securely, and though the winds and the 
downpours and the waters storm against it, it still stands, 
and lets the angry winds, the raging rains, and the raging 
waters rush by, and whistles after them with a little cliff, 
saying, "Behold! Was it you, angry lords and scholars, 
who wanted to snatch me away and destroy me? 


Behold, here | still stand, you are past; who knows where 
you remain, | nevertheless remain here. 

2 So now we let the papists, the Rottists, the 
Erasmists, with their blasohemies and lies, rush upon us 
also, and strike at our rock, and run up and down, and 
judge who will mock the other at the last. They defy that 
they have much wind, rain and water; we insist that we 
have nothing but a small, poor, patient rock, and if it 
could fear as much as they are angry (perhaps they are), 
then we would truly also have to build on water, wind and 
rain. But it is better to throw ourselves into the water, 
wind and rain than to build on them. For if one builds on 
it, it falls to pieces; if one throws it in, it flows and flows 
away, so that the stench does not harm our noses, and 
finally remains with them in the abyss of the sea, yes, of 
hell, where they go and want to go; the devil leads them. 
Our rock protect us, and stand by us, amen.

1 Christ, our dear Lord, when he had fed five thousand 
men with five barley loaves, commanded his disciples to 
gather the rest of the loaves, that nothing should perish, 
John the sixth, v. 12. According to the same command, 
| also have taken up this little book, that it perish not; 
which, of course, is not contrary to good works. 


One of the fragments is left over from the gracious food 
of the Holy Gospel, so that God, the Father of all grace 
and mercy, now feeds the world so abundantly and 
wonderfully. And to such fragments | have woven this 
basket, that is, this preface, in which it would be 
gathered and kept. 


*The book of Caspar Huberinus, "Vom Zorn und der Giite GOttes" ("Of Wrath and the Goodness of God") was published in Wittenberg 
in 1529 and again in 1538 in octavo and in Lower Saxon dialect in Magdeburg in 1544 in octavo. Luther's preface to it is found in the Eisleben 
edition, vol. |, p. 482; in the Altenburg edition, vol. IV, p. 703; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XXII, appendix, p. 94 and in the Erlangen edition, vol.

**In 1529, Luther had the treatise by Thomas Venatorius, "A Short Instruction to Hold Before Dying People in a Completely

482; in the Altenburg, vol. IV, p. 703; in the Leipzig, vol. XXII, appendix, p. 94 and in the Erlangen, vol. 63, p. 284. We give the text according

2. and is well worth it, because it is a useful little book, 
which does not deal with foolish works or useless 
gossip, as now, unfortunately, the world is full of useless, 
harmful books and writers, but deals with the right 
necessity and main things, which the enthusiastic spirits 
and mad saints have almost completely obscured with 
their great, exuberant wisdom and wisdom, since God 
protects us for it. 

(3) For even our adversaries had this booklet printed 
and spread out before we did, so that they might confess 
that there is nothing evil in it, but only good, which they 
themselves must praise and honor. Now there is no 
papist doctrine in it, but the right Lutheran one (as they 
call it), since it is obvious that all papists in one bunch, 
with all their art, are not able to make such a booklet, no 
matter how small it may be, because they do not have 
such a mind. 

(4) And | will believe that if my name or any other well- 
known Lutheran name had been written on it, they would 
neither have printed it nor read it; just as they have often 
praised my own books and read them with pleasure 
when my name is torn from them. So my name is an evil 
thing: if it is written on a book, it is evil, however good it 
may be; if it is not written on it, it is good, however evil it 
may be. 

5 | have also not wanted to do or change anything in this 
booklet (which | have also 


297 


| did not know how to do it well), but have let it stay in its 
measure and at all, as | got it printed, so that | do not 
spoil it and take away its natural strength and juice with 
my superstition, or rob it of its taste, as commonly 
happens to good books when Master Kliigling comes 
over them; as also happened to my New Testament, 
which the blasphemer and Sudeler in Meissen 1) has let 
pass for his own. 

For this reason, | ask all dear friends, both preachers 
and listeners, to be diligent and to help practice this main 
part of Christian doctrine, namely faith. For the foolish 
saints, papists, and red spirits, truly do not understand 
what the piece is, therefore they do not practice it either. 
And the devil, through all their mad holiness and 
spirituality, does not seek badly to raise up their mad 
holiness, but rather to destroy this main piece, which 
crushes his head and destroys his kingdom. Truly, he 
does not care so much about other things. Therefore, let 
us be courageous and beware, he is not asleep, he is 
trying and trying to overthrow and disrupt the faith and 
with it the true church. May Christ our Lord be with us 
and not forsake us, to whom be praise, glory and 
thanksgiving forever and ever, amen.

Preface by Martini Luther. 


1 | have often and long undertaken to compile such 
a book myself, as it is from the decree and spiritual laws, 
and that the same to our spiritual and temporal lords, 


who follow our doctrine, so that they may see how 


completely blind they are, who not only do not hold their 
own doctrine, but also condemn it as vain heresy. From 


this one can well feel how great

Let it be serious that they pretend to expel heresy, who 


are not so diligent about the matter that they might know 
and learn what they themselves believe, or what their 
own doctrine is, or how far it is against us, but go along 
badly: We do not like this doctrine, therefore let it be 
heresy, even if it were our own doctrine and set in our 
books. But what good is there in such people who 
condemn other people and themselves, and do not 
know why, how, or when? 

(2) | know of a great archbishop, whom | will not 
name, who thought much of St. Cyprian, the holy bishop 
and martyr, and read a little of his books against the 
Lutherans, as if he meant to overthrow them; but when 
it was pointed out to him that in the same St. Cyprian's 
books the holy Christian church was not only in Rome 
but in all the ends of the world, he said. Cypriani's books, 
how the holy Christian church was not only in Rome, but 
in all the ends of the world, he said, "If | knew that 
Cyprian taught this, | would also burn his books as a 
heretic. And when this was presented to him in the book, 
he threw away St. Cyprian with his book, and would not 
read the heretic. 





But because they want to remain blinded and 
hardened by God, we must honor the truth and show 
with this book how the wretched people not only teach 
and live so differently from the ancient fathers, but also 
against their own right, which is why they fight, rage and 
rage so shamefully until he comes who will redeem us 
and repay them according to their merit. 

4 Therefore this booklet pleases me well, and is also 
well worth reading, for we have so far offered ourselves 
so highly to desist and to do everything that they could 
only set and command, when they left us free only the 
main pieces of Christian doctrine, which are also much 
in their own book of laws, and they themselves know 
nothing about it. May Christ our Lord hear our sighs and 
prayers, and put an end to all error and evil; to Him be 
praise and glory, together with the Father and the Holy 
Spirit for ever and ever, amen.

Alkoran" 1) and equally a "Selection from the Alkorau" 


(Cribratio Alcorani) of Nicolaus of Cufa, but until now 
| wish in vain to read the Alkoran. One could see that 
both that "refuter" and the author of the "selection" 


(Cribrator) wanted to deter the more simple-minded 
Christians from Mahomet and keep them in the faith in 
Christ; But since they are too eager to read out of the 
Alkoran everything that is exceedingly shameful and 
inconsistent, which arouses hatred and can move the 
common man to spite, and either pass over the good that 
is in it without having refuted it, or conceal it, it has 
happened that they have found very little faith and 
reputation, as if they had published theirs out of hatred 
for them or because of their inability to refute it. 

This man, however, whoever the author of this book 
may have been, seems to treat the matter with the 
greatest fidelity. Through this faithfulness he has also 
gained great reputation with me, so that | firmly believe 
him as one who tells the truth honestly. And although 
there are small and minor things that he tells, and | would 
like to have more and greater things, he nevertheless 
also shows the small and minor things faithfully. For he 
tells them in such a way that he not only reports the evil 
that is found among them, but also contrasts it with the 
very good that they have, and praises it in such a way 
that he punishes and reproves our people by comparing 
them with them. And yet he does not call it good, as if it 
were done godly, but refutes it heartily and vigorously, 
as much as was possible at that time. These, of course, 
are certain signs of a sincere and honest mind, which 
writes nothing out of hatred, but tells everything out of 
love for the truth. For he who only rebukes the enemy, 
and only what is disgraceful and 


1) This will probably be the scripture which Luther translated and 
published in 1542. It is found in our edition vol. XX, 2218 ff. 





He who heaps accusations on what is untruthful about 
him, but conceals what is honorable and praiseworthy 
about him, does more harm than good to the cause. For 
what is easier than to publicly accuse shameful and 
dishonorable things (which refute themselves)? But to 
refute good and honorable things by stripping them of 
their beautiful appearance, that is, to benefit the cause, 
that is, to avert arousal and to deprive the angel of light 
of his lying form, and to make him hateful by his own 
shamefulness and deprivation of light. 

From this book we see that the religion of the Turks 
or Mahomet in the ceremonies, | would almost say also 
in the customs, has a much more beautiful appearance 
than that of ours, also of the monks and all clergymen. 
2) For such modesty and simplicity in eating and 
drinking, in dress, in dwellings and all things, as this book 
indicates, likewise such fasts and prayers, such general 
gatherings of the people are nowhere to be seen among 
our people, indeed it is impossible to persuade our 
common people to do so. Then, the astonishing and 
unbelievable severity of fasting and mortification among 
their monks, - which of our monks would not be put to 
shame, whether he be a Carthusian (who want to be 
considered the best) or a Benedictine? Our monks are 
only shadows compared to them, and our common 
people are quite unholy compared to their common 
people. Nor even the true Christians, neither Christ 
himself, nor the apostles, nor the prophets have ever had 
so great a beautiful appearance. And this is the cause 
that many so easily fall away from the faith in Christ. 


2) As a sample of translation, we here communicate how the 
preceding sentence in Jonas reads: "Thus we shall see in this little 
book that the Turk's and Mahomet's religion, ceremonies and false 
worship have a much greater, more splendid appearance and shine 
more gloriously than old knotted ropes, downcast eyes, gray caps, 
wooden shoes of the barefoot monks or all our monasticism. 





It is striking that both the Jena and Erlangen editions have brought this translation of Jonas, because both principally only reproduce Luther's 
writings in the language he used. In Latin, the preface is found in the Erlangen edition, oxp. var. ar’., tom. VII, x. 514. According to the text 


offered in the same, we have translated it anew.

fall away from Mahomet and cling to him so stubbornly. 
| fully believe that no pope, monk, clergyman, 1) or 
follower of their faith, if he spent three days among the 
Turks, would remain in his faith. | am talking about those 
who sincerely hold the faith of the pope and are the best 
among them. The other group and the largest part of 
them, especially the Whales, believe nothing at all, 
because they are swine from the army of Epicurus; they 
are secure against all heresy and error, and strong and 
unconquerable in their Epicurean faith, both against 
Christ and against Mahomet and against their own pope. 
And for this purpose we publish this book and thrust it 
under the eyes of those who are hostile to the Gospel, 
so that they, having been disgraced in their foolish 
opinion, may learn by the thing itself and grasp with their 
own hands that what the Gospel teaches is true, namely, 
that the Christian religion is something quite different 
and higher than apparent ceremonies, plates, caps, sour 


feasts, fasts, feast days, seventh tides (horas canonica) 
and all the offerings of the Roman church throughout the 
world. For in all these things the Turks are very far in the 
lead, who deny and most fervently persecute Christ, no 
less than our papists deny and persecute him. Then they 
can also see with their hands that this is true, namely, 
that the Christian religion is something far different from 
good morals or good works, for this book shows that in 
these things, too, the Turks are far superior to the 
Christians. 

Go therefore, ye tyrants and bishops, and slay, burn, 
slay, chase away, and rage in full fury for the faith of 
Christ, that is, for the sake of your ceremonies, although 
ye see here that the bright glow of your ceremonies is 
not a bright glow compared with the glorious:: bright 
glow of the Turks, and that your customs, compared with 
the customs of them, are clearly abominable. Therefore 
we publish this book at the same time as a kind of 
defense for our gospel. For now | see what the cause 
has been, 


1) Instead of elsruin we have assumed elsrieuru. Jonas offers: "that 
among the papists no monk, priest, canon or curtisan" 2c. 





why the religion of the Turks was kept so hidden by the 
papists, why they only told what is shameful about them, 
namely because they realized, which is also really the 
case, that if it came to a dispute about religion, the whole 
papacy would have to fall with all its members, and they 
would not be able to protect their faith and refute the faith 
of Mahomet, since they would have had to refute that 
which they themselves approve of to the highest degree 
and on which they rely most, and to protect that which 
they approve of to the highest degree and on which they 
rely most::. 

There are, | confess, many things among the Turks 
that are disgraceful and unrighteous, even in 
appearance, and perhaps there are more of them in the 
meantime, and the Turks are now not all as they are 
portrayed in this book, which was published before the 
capture of Constantinople, that is, seventy years ago, as 
everything tends to get worse with time. But these evil 
things are nicely covered by the so effective and strong 
appearance of ceremonies, good customs and false 
miracles. For what a shameful nature was not also 
among our people in so many abominations of pleasure, 
avarice, greed, pride, jealousy, discord, blasphemy, lies, 
vanity, impiety, so that we surpassed Sodom and 
Gomorrah, and yet this was concealed by a much 
weaker appearance of ceremonies than that of the 
Turks, that all this was not seen, and they were 
nevertheless considered saints: how much less will the 
Turks be moved by their shameful things adorned by 
such religious ceremonies! 

Therefore we publish this book also with this second 
intention, that we may prevent the Mahometan arousal. 
For since we now have the Turk and his religion in the 
neighborhood, ours must be reminded that they should 
not be moved by the beautiful appearance of the religion 
of those people and the prestige of their customs, or by 
the low prestige of our faith and the 


2) Instead of utilitats we have assumed vititats. Jonas offers: "and 
whether our holy Christian faith seems less".

The Christian, who is annoyed by the vexatious form of 
the customs, denies his Christianity and follows 
Mahomet, but learns that the religion of Christ is 
something other than ceremonies and customs, and that 
for the Christian faith it is not at all decisive which of the 
two ceremonies, customs and laws is better or worse; but 
he throws them all into one heap and declares that they 
are not sufficient for righteousness, and that they are not 
necessary. If we do not learn this, there is danger that 
very many of our people will become Turks, since they 
are otherwise already inclined to much less brilliant 
errors. 

And although the author of this book sufficiently 
scourges the unrighteous and shameful things of the 
Turks, and then also refutes their glaring agitations (by 
which, as he confesses, he himself was moved and 
sometimes fell) quite clearly and correctly, we still see 
that at that time our highest protection and our strongest 
weapons were not so publicly displayed, which are the 
articles of Christ: Namely, that Christ is the Son of GOD, 
dead to our sins, raised again that we might live, that we 
might be justified by faith in him, and blessed through the 
forgiveness of sins 2c. These are the thunderbolts that 
destroy not only Mahomet but also the gates of hell. For 
Mahomet denies that Christ is the Son of God, he denies 
that he died for our sins, he denies that he rose from the 
dead to bring us to life, he denies that through faith in him 
sins are forgiven and we are justified, he denies that he 
will come as judge of the living and the dead, as 





Although he believes in a resurrection of the dead anda 
day of judgment, he denies the Holy Spirit, he denies His 
gifts. By these and similar articles the conscience must 
be fortified against the ceremonies of Mahomet, by these 
means his Alkoran must be refuted. 

For if someone denies the articles just mentioned, 
what can it profit him if he also has a spirituality of angels, 
if he is also twice as spiritual as the Turks? On the other 
hand, if a man holds to these articles, what harm can it 
do him if he neither fasts so much, prays, watches, 
abstains, nor is so modest in food and drink, clothing, 
offerings, and housekeeping? The Turks, the Papists 
may be glorious in these things, but at the same time 
they lack the right faith and are full of other exceedingly 
shameful vices and are an abomination before God and 
hateful to men. But it is to the author's credit that, 
hindered by the infirmity that was common to all in his 
time, he did not touch upon the greater things, and that 
what he did touch upon, he set forth in the manner of 
writing common to his time. He is to be praised, however, 
for his excellent zeal, for his sincerity and diligence, by 
which he faithfully accomplished as much as he was 
able. | will perhaps say more when Mahomet himself and 
his Alkoran come into my hands. For | hope that our 
gospel, which shines in such great light, will also make 
an attack on Mahomet, the abominable prophet, before 
the day of judgment. May our Lord Jesus Christ do this 
soon, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.

The first part of the book is a preface from Justus Menius' booklet: Der 
Wiedertaufer Lehre und Geheimnif aus heiliger Schrift widerlegt (The 
Anahantists' Doctrine and Mvsterv Refuted from Holv Scrinture). *) 


Preface Mart. Luther. 


1 Our Lord Jesus Christ proclaimed clearly enough in 
Matth. 18, 7, that his dear church must always suffer 
from riots and sects, when he says: "There must be 
offenses, but woe to the man through whom the offenses 
come. St. Paul also said in 1 Cor. 11:19: "There must be 
heresies, so that the proven ones may be revealed"; and 
2 Pet. 2:1: "But there will be false teachers among you, 
just as there were false prophets among them," as has 
been the case from the beginning of Christianity, even in 
the time of the apostles, until now, and will continue to 
be the case until the end of the world. For Christ is a King 
and Lord, therefore he must also contend and fight. But 
if he contends spiritually with the truth against the lie, the 
lie resists and will not be defeated. So the mobs begin, 
and there is such noise and tumult in Christendom. 

(2) Therefore let no one be astonished or dismayed 
when he sees the rise of the heretics among Christians, 
and their terrible railing against the truth. If you are a 
Christian and believe Christ and his apostles, then you 
must also believe this and wait for them when they say 
that there must come revolts and rebellion [1 Cor. 11:19], 
and consider their word to be no lie, or loose, frivolous 
speech, but that they speak of honest, great, terrible 
things, as God's word is to speak. And you must not let 
it be strange to you when they come, but get used to it, 
so that you can say, "Go ahead and let come what is 
coming, | have already heard it. 





knew very well that there would have to be a mob; if it is 
not them, it must be others; if they leave, it is others who 
are watching. If you want to have the good gospel, you 
must also have the hellish gates and devils, so that you 
do not have the same gospel with love and peace, as 
Christ says: "I give you my peace, not as the world gives" 
[John 14:28]. 


And in sum, the devil is a poltergeist and rumbling 
spirit, he can't stop poltergeist and rumbling. Up to now, 
under the pope, he has rumbled in houses, in churches, 
in the fields, in the woods, and thus has established a 
soul market, has offered and sold souls for sale, thereby 
dragging the mass and all Christian works into purgatory, 
even into hell, and putting all the world's goods into 
slothful bellies, even sinking them into monasteries and 
monastery cloacas and secret chambers. Now, however, 
such a soul market has been laid low for him, he is 
causing a new riot and another rumble, through the 
spirits of the mobs. Therefore, just as we are no longer 
afraid of the rumbling spirits in houses, we should also 
no longer be afraid of his! Therefore, just as we are no 
longer afraid of the rumbling spirits in houses, we should 
also no longer be afraid of their rumbling in the huts; 
there must be rumbling and rumbling as long as the 
world stands. 


(4) But everything must be to our advantage, and not 
to our benefit. First of all, that we are trained to act and 
keep the word of God more diligently, and thus become 
more certain of the truth the longer. For if we did not have 
such groups, through which the devil wakes us up, we 
would become too lazy, sleep and snore ourselves to 
death, and both faith and word would be lost in us.

XXII, appendix, p. 98 and in the Erlanger, vol. 63, p. 290. We give the text after the latter, since it brings the original print.

darken and corrode until everything is spoiled. But now, 
such mobs are our grindstone and polisher, sharpening 
and polishing our faith and doctrine so that they shine 
smoothly and purely like a mirror, getting to know the 
devil and his thoughts, and becoming fit and skilful to 
fight against him, which would all remain, where we 
would have peace from the mobs. 

(5) Secondly, the word itself is brought to light before the 
world in a more powerful and brighter way, so that many 
learn the truth through such warfare, or are strengthened 
in it, who otherwise would not be able to do so, because 
it is a busy thing about the word of God, therefore God 
also gives it work, hangs on it and hounds both the devil 
and the world, so that its power and virtue are revealed 
and the lie is put to shame. Whether some are deceived 
by this is also right, and is done for punishment and 
vengeance on the godless, proud despisers and 
ungrateful people who persecute, blaspheme or despise 
our teachings. For what devout, simple hearts are 
deceived besides, there is hope that they may come to 
right again. But the proud and the clever shall be 
hardened within, and shall receive in themselves the 
reward of their ingratitude and their own trustworthy 
prudence. 

6 You will find all this in abundance here in this fine book, 
how God exercises and strengthens our faith through the 
lazy, lame lies of the Anabaptists; and again, how justly 
he punishes their proud conceit and ingratitude, that 
they, blinded and obdurate, speak such foolish things, 
and therefore do not like to come into the light, but hide 
their poison in the darkness. And although all their lies in 
this book are clearly and powerfully overcome, | will also 
give a little indication, so that one may think that the devil 
has sent them out, and deal with vain lies, although it is 
all understood in this book. 

(7) First of all, this is a sure sign of the devil, that they 
creep through the houses, and walk about in the country, 
and do not appear in public. 


1) In the original and in the Wittenberg (at both locations): "glw". 
This has already been resolved by the Jena edition by: glatt. Cf. 
Walch, St. Louis edition, vol. IX, 856, K 94. 





They do not preach as the apostles did, and all ordinary 
preachers do daily, but are vain preachers of lies, and 
come even into strange houses and places, where they 
are neither called nor sent of any man, neither can they 
bring any certain reason nor sign for such creeping and 
running. This piece is not lacking, and it is certain that 
they come from the devil, as Christ says John 10:8: "All 
who come before me are thieves and murderers." Thus | 
have just admonished Psalm 82, 4. 2) both authorities 
and subjects, that one should not suffer such sneakers, 
assassin teachers and angle preachers, because there is 
no God, but certainly the devil himself, no matter what it 
may be. 

8. secondly, their doctrine is nothing else than worldly 
goods, temporal, carnal and earthly promises, which the 
mob likes to hear, namely, that they, like the Jews and 
Turks, will invent a kingdom on earth, in which all the 
wicked will be slain and they alone will have good days. 
Who would not like that? That is a public, tangible lie. For 
Christ has not appointed a worldly kingdom for His own, 
but a heavenly kingdom, and says [John 16:33], "In the 
world ye shall be in anguish and distress." Item [Cap. 18, 
36]: "My kingdom is not of this world," and means that we 
deny this world and wait for the kingdom of heaven, 
otherwise the former saints and martyrs, Christ and all 
the apostles would have to go without such a worldly 
kingdom; therefore this piece is a sure sign that the devil 
is riding them. 

(9) Thirdly, that they teach that Christ will kill the wicked 
by the sword, and will command the sword to such 
covenant-breakers; there thou seest manifestly the 
murderous, seditious, revengeful spirit, whose breath 
stinketh for the sword. And, that is still much finer, they 
preach themselves, they want to be such fellows, to lead 
the sword, and that they would have cleaned the lies so, 
that not they themselves, but others should do, as the 
prophets prophesy of the future Christians, so it would 
have a little color. But these fellows are not comfortable 
with their neighbors. 


2) See Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. V, 720, §56ff. 


310 Erl. 33, 294-296. 


Therefore they must preach themselves, not Christ nor 
his works, but what they would like to do and their 
murderous works. 

(10) But we know that Christ commanded not a sword 
unto his own, but forbade it, saying Luc. 22:26, "But ye 
shall not be or do so." He has not revoked such a word, 
nor will he punish himself with lies, and will not kill the 
wicked with the sword, but with the breath or spirit of his 
mouth, and by the appearance of his future he will put 
them to death. Therefore this is a sure and tangible sign 
that it is the wicked devil. 

(11) Fourthly, behold, how finely they teach of good 
works; saying, they give their good works for a penny. 
With this they want to be our monkeys, and teach us, 
because they have heard that we teach that good works 
do not make one pious, nor do they wipe out sin, nor do 
they reconcile God. The devil adds to this and despises 
good works so much that he wants to sell them all for a 
penny. | praise God, my Lord, that the devil, in his 
prudence, must so shamefully abuse and deceive 
himself. 

(12) We teach, then, that God's reconciling, 
sanctifying, and atoning for sin is such a high, great, and 
glorious work that Christ, the Son of God, alone must do 
it, and that it is actually a pure, simple, and special work 
of the one true God and His grace, to which our works 
are nothing, nor are they able. But that therefore good 
works should be nothing, or worth a penny, who has ever 
taught or heard it, except now from the lying mouth of 
the devil?

(13) | would not give one of my sermons, one of my 
lectures, one of my writings, one of my father-universes, 
yes, however small works | have always done, or still do, 
for the goods of the whole bet; yes, | consider it more 
precious than my body's life, which is and should be 
dearer to everyone than the whole bet. For if it is a good 
work, God has done it through me and in me. If God has 
done it, and if it is God's work, what is the whole world 
against God and His work? Even if | do not become godly 
through such a work (for that must first come about 
through Christ's blood and grace, without any work), it 
has nevertheless been done for God's praise and honor, 
for the neighbor's benefit and salvation, none of which 
can be paid for or compared with the good of the world. 
And this fine mob takes a penny for it. Oh, how finely the 
devil has hidden himself here! Who could not grab him 
here? 


14. against faith they teach a worldly kingdom; against 
good works they teach temporal goods and money, and 
had them less than a penny; against the cross they teach 
sword and vengeance. Oh, they must be tender and fine 
Christians to me! Therefore, he who believes such 
obvious, tangible lies and blasphemy of the devil, is 
surely damned. But further you will find in the book itself 
and see how Christ attacks, overthrows and destroys this 
lying spirit; to him be praise and thanksgiving forever, 
together with the Father and Holy Spirit, true God and 
Lord, amen.

[First Sermon.] 
Of the Most Holy Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ. 


Preface Martini Luther. 


1. Although | Know that my letter is now lost among the 
papists, and is completely in vain, because they gave 
themselves to the devil after this Diet, or just as Satan 
went into Judah after the holy morsel of bread, and 
possessed him completely, so also now, after all our 
high and faithful admonition, pleading and request, 
Satan has gone into the papists and possessed them 
completely, so that they are hardened, and can now no 
longer hear nor suffer God's word or work: Nevertheless 
| will not cease or be silent, but will cry out and cry to my 
grave, and shall cry no more, but cry trembling and 
murder over the hardened wicked, and with me exhort 
all that can cry out, at last also stone and wood, until our 
crying up in heaven compels our faithful Saviour and 
righteous Judge to descend and see how poor Lot fare 
in this shameful Sodoma. 

(2) And as they ask nothing after our writing, 
supplications, entreaties, cries, and shouts, but always 
continue: so will | also, together with mine, ask nothing 
after their raging and tumulting, but also always continue 
and confidently cry out; will see who is the first to grow 
weary, or the last to cease. Perhaps God will continue 


That over that they are spiritually mad and senseless, 
they may also be possessed bodily, and so become 
thoroughly mad and foolish according to their merit, 
amen. 

(3) For we have the advantage that our cry is not without 
our great benefit, and their raging is not without their 
great harm, and our benefit is many. First, that God's 
name and His word are honored, as with a proper 
service and sacrifice of thanksgiving that pleases Him. 
Secondly, that God's word may be the more abundantly 
(according to the teachings of St. Paul) practiced among 
us, so that many may be instructed, strengthened in the 
faith and admonished. 

Thus it also serves that the papists are overwhelmed 
with the multitude of divine testimonies, and are 
incessantly accused before God, and are finally 
disgraced before the world, so that they can have all the 
less excuse, and are condemned all the deeper into the 
abyss of hell, and also perish all the sooner. For because 
they force us to such cries with their rage, it will not be 
long with them, God cannot suffer such cries for long. | 
know this for certain, as Christ says Luc. 18, 7. 8.: 
"Should God not save His elect, who day and night 


1) "before" is missing in the Erlanger. 


*M. Alexius CroBner was Canonicus at Altenburg and court preacher of Duke Georg. On June 8, 1527, he preached a sermon on John 
6:55 of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ at the Schléffe in Dresden, and on June 29, 1527, he preached a sermon on the Holy 
Christian Church. He had to leave Dresden. In 1531 he had these two sermons printed and dedicated them to Duke George, but not exactly 
as he had preached them, but increased and improved. Luther wrote a special preface to each of these sermons. The first appeared under 
the title: "Ein Sermon vom Hochwirdigen heiligen Sacrament, des leibs vnd bluts Christi, durch Alexium Crosner von Colditz auff dem Schlos 
zu Dresden jnn Meisten gepredigt. With a preface by Mart. Luther. Wittemberg H).XXXI." 8 quarto sheets. At the end: "Gedruckt zu Wittemberg

cry out to him? Yes, | tell you, he will save them in a short 
time." 

5 It is read in the book of Joseph that at the time 
Jerusalem was besieged by the Romans, and they 
remained obdurate and unrepentant, as our Papists are 
now, a man was found running about in the city and on 
the walls, crying out, Woe, woe, woe to thee, Jerusalem! 
and no one could make him speak nor keep him silent; 
they brought him before the lords and had him beaten, 
but it was no use. He cried out in unison until he was shot 
on the wall. So we must also cry out against our 
hardened enemies of God and murderers of Christians, 
the papists, as long as we live, until the judge comes, 
and brings with him the hammer and mace, that 1) he 
may break such iron hard heads of the desperate 
wicked. 

For this reason, these two sermons by Alexis have 
pleased me well, and | would rather have them printed 
than a murderous cry against the papists, who now, as 
nonsensical rabid people, profess at the same time that 
it is right to administer and receive both forms of the 
Sacrament, and yet, out of wanton, right malice, and no 
other cause, forbid, blaspheme, and persecute such 
right, and in addition, with all kinds of sins against the 
Holy Spirit, without ceasing, profane and defy God to the 
highest degree. 

(7) And | do not let them go out because the damned 
enemies of God should be convinced or overcome with 
it. For they know it themselves, and confess it 
themselves, that they are overcome, and that our cause 
is right, especially in this article; much less that | would 
admonish them with it, or move them to concede and 
relent in such an article. Such humility and mercy toward 
them is over. | have now done this for ten years and 
more, for too much enough. The devil begs them again 
to grant it. And the devil also thanks them for letting us 
have it. We have it, and we want it, and we do not want 
to look at them, but because of this | want to publicly 
accuse them before God and the world, cry out and 
expose them, so that they will be disgraced and mocked 
forever, as those who, out of devilish malice and with 
unheard-of iniquity, have violated God's word.

(which they profess to be God's word and order) 
knowingly condemn, blaspheme and forbid, so that our 
descendants may know what devilish people lived in our 
time and what horrible, monstrous beasts we had to deal 
with. Otherwise, perhaps no one among our 
descendants would believe that such great wickedness 
could have existed on earth. For | myself could not 
believe that such wickedness would come into a human 
heart that could say: This is God's word, | know it well, 
yet | will not suffer it, but condemn and blaspheme it, 
only because | do not want it. 

8 These two sermons also help to strengthen our 
people. For the more witnesses of the truth there are, 
the better they strengthen the faith of the weak, and 
ward off the counterclaims and poisonous fables. For | 
hear that now in Halle some cryers pretend that there is 
no danger; if they are obedient to the authorities and use 
one figure, they do not sin. One must be obedient to the 
authorities. 

The wretched evil-doers, who before our letter never 
knew anything about obedience to the authorities, but 
tore all authorities to pieces and trampled them 
underfoot, now cry out from our teaching: one should be 
obedient to the authorities. They have already forgotten, 
even disregard, where they brought the poor man, D. 
Krausen, 2) with such poisonous speech; the shameful 
murderers of souls and bloodhounds wanted to increase 
and multiply such terrible examples. 

10. God does not give us much authority in this. It is 
said that all authority here shall be called lowliness. All 
majesty here shall be lowliness. Let all the world shut its 
mouth. For God the Most High speaks here, it is His 
word that we act upon, but one must be more obedient 
to God than to men (Apost. 5, 29.]. And it does not help 
that we are obedient to the authorities, where we thereby 
become disobedient to God. He has already made the 
judgment, Matth. 15, 8. 9.: "This people honors me in 
vain with commandments and doctrines of men." What 
will he judge about those who do not serve him with 
human commandments and teachings alone, but set 
their human commandments and teachings against and 
above his divine commandments and teachings? 


2) For v. Krause, see Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. IX, 262, note.

They condemn his words and his order, which he 
himself instituted for his worship, so that their anti- 
Christian and anti-godly service might continue. 


(11) Therefore, let every man watch and 
beware of such poisonous mouths, and let the 
example of D. Krausen be to him a greater 
terror and dread than the terror and dread of 
his furious tyrant. For with D. Krausen's 
example God himself, who lives eternally, 
dreads and terrifies. But with the 
commandments of men, tyrants, who are 
nothing but water bubbles and dead lice 
bellies, soon have to leave, as Isa. 8, 12. says: 
"Do not be afraid of their terror." And again 
[Isa. 51:12]: Why are you afraid of a man 


who dies? 

12) But if anyone would let himself be overthrown, 
and his devil's head, that is, his furious authority, 
would become willina, he should watch and still 





and is much worse than sin, for which he repents and 
atones. God does not want the death of the sinner, nor 
does He want those who have fallen to be rejected 
[Ezek. 18, 32. 33, 11.] It is enough if one recognizes his 
sin and repents of it. Let those repent and atone who 
defend their sin, and after they have defiled God and His 
word, still want to be right and pious in it. It is a much, 
much greater sin to force people to willfully sin against 
God than to sin against God out of fear. The latter is a 
papal and episcopal sin, but this is a human sin. 
Nevertheless, one should not sin for the sake of man, 
much less sin on the mercy of God, as some crude, 
impudent souls do. 

God, our Father, grant that these two sermons may 
well comfort and strengthen the pious, and may well cry 
out the papists, and bring them to all shame before God 
and the world, amen. 


[Second Sermon.] 
From the Holy Christian Church. 


The papists have introduced a new article in the 

faith, which is called: We clergy are the holy Christian 
church, and paint ourselves as sitting in a ship, and 
the other Christians as swimming in the sea and 
rising. All their buildings are based on this, with their 
teachings and life, and they conclude that they 
cannot be mistaken, but that what they teach and do 
is vain law and the article of the Christian faith. For 
the Christian church is so holy that it cannot err, 
neither in life nor in doctrine. So surely the Holy Spirit 
governs it. When the article was in his power and 
ruled, they did well; what they wanted had to be right 
or wrong, as we have experienced at times, and 
unfortunately all too often; and if it were to be proven 
even today, we would have to let go and do whatever 
they wanted. 
(2) But now the fruits of the clergy, both with 
doctrines and life, are so bright in the day that they 
themselves must confess, and do confess, that it is 
not holy, but harmful, worse, and worse. 





It is not a bad thing, and may not be appropriate for 
the holy Christian church. Therefore, it is necessary 
to recognize what the holy Christian church is. If it is 
the clergy with their mobs, then the devil has won, 
and we both, God and His Word, have lost. For, even 
if they are most blatantly wrong, who will accuse 
them of error or judge them? If God's word is taken 
against them, they can say: We may not err, we are 
the holy church, and therefore all error must be 
considered holy, free and unpunished. 

(3) From this it must follow that their avarice, 
fornication, and other vices must be vain virtues. For 
where thou wouldest say, In some things and 
manifest vices, which are contrary to the word of 
God, they may well be reproved, judged, and 
punished; but fornication with the © sixth 
commandment, and with the sayings of St. Paul; that 
endureth and accomplisheth nothing. For since they 
publicly condemn the one form of the sacrament 
against the word of God, and condemn 


Z18 Erl. 63, 3V3-306. 


Prefaces by D. Martin Luther. W. xiv, 239-292. 


319 





They want to be unjudged and unpunished with such 
God's word, but say that the church cannot err in this, 
even if it does against God's word, and have the 
intercession of the Holy Spirit against it. 

(4) Let them then act against such a great, high 
article of the sacrament, and say: We cannot err, the 
Holy Spirit governs us thus, as rather a priest may have 
a fence against the lesser commandment of God, and 
say: | cannot err, the Holy Spirit governs me thus. But if 
they cannot do this in a minor article, how can they do it 
in such a major article? 

For this reason | have let this sermon of M. Alexii go 
out, so that everyone may see or learn from now on what 
the holy Christian church is called and what it is. Where 
this is well recognized, one has a great, comforting 
protection against all false teaching. For of course this 
must be true: that the Christian church is holy, and may 
not err in the faith, because with Christ it is One Body 
and One Spirit. But here, truly, one must also diligently 
notice and know what is meant by holy, and what is 
meant by error in the faith. For even today our papists 
teach us no other holiness than that which is in us and 
is attained by works, although here a sharp and certain 
distinction must be kept between holiness by works and 
holiness in the church, and between faith and works or 
life. 

6 For this must be confessed, that the church has not 
become, nor can become, the holy church by works or 
merit, what 





Would Christ with his death otherwise be necessary or 
useful to us? Thus, the holy church cannot be without 
error and sin even for the sake of life, otherwise it would 
have to lie and mock God when it asks in the Lord's 
Prayer: "Forgive us our trespasses" [Luc. 11, 4]. And 
Christ himself would also have to lie, since he calls his 
dear apostles, who were holy: "You are wicked and 
without understanding 2c. [And there can be no saint 
who does not have to pray the Lord's Prayer; and the 
Church altogether, if it is the holiest, must also pray it. 
Behold, the papists have never thought of such things, 
and make vain saints of works in heaven, and among so 
many legends of the saints there is not one that 
describes a saint who would have been holy according 
to Christian holiness, or according to the holiness of the 
faith. All their holiness is that they prayed a lot, fasted, 
worked, chastised, lay hard and dressed. What kind of 
holiness even a dog and a sow can practice every day. 

(7) Therefore we must speak differently of the matter, 
and know that the Christian church is holy, not in itself, 
especially in this life, but in Christ; and is a sanctification 
of grace, begun here and accomplished in that world. 
But in itself it is not yet holy, as St. Paul to the Romans 
Cap. 6 and 8 clearly teaches of all Christians. But you 
will find further meaning in this sermon. God help us all 
to stay with the pure truth until the end; praise and 
thanks be to Him for eternity, Amen.

He is always devoted to the divine work and creature that 
we call the marriage state. How reluctantly he lets men 
come into it! How he resists with fornication and other 
carnal vices! But even more reluctantly he lets people 
stay inside. How he has to do here with all his angels (as 
if he had nothing else to do on earth), how he makes 
man and woman divided, drives them apart, tears them 
apart with adultery and murder, or, if they will not or 
cannot run away from each other, he makes such a 
miserable life out of it that it might well be called a hell, 
in which the husband is the wife and the wife the 
husband's devil. 

(3) Above this, he made the matter of marriage much 
worse through the pope. First of all, he condemned it as 
a state in which one could not serve God, which is why 
he made the celibate spiritual state a service to God, so 
that the married state, God's work and highly blessed 
creature, had to stink, be nothing, and be considered a 
disgrace compared to the great, glorious honor of the 
chaste celibate clergy. Although God smelled such 
disgrace of his creature, and paid the celibates honestly, 
blinded them and pushed them to the point that Sodoma 
and Gomorrah seem to be holy compared to their 
impudent, abominable, blasphemous whore life and boy 
life. And it was right for them, because they knew that it 
was a work of God, and yet did not praise nor honor, but 
condemned and blasphemed, he gave them uprightly in 
a wrong mind, so that nothing could please them but the 
most shameful custom and lust of the flesh, and they 
received their reward in their own bodies, as it was due 
[Rom. 1:24 ff]. 

Secondly, that he has confused marriage with such 
cords of his laws that no one can get behind him or in 
front of him. He divorces spouses for adultery, but does 
not allow them to change. Forces to chastity a man from 
whom his wife has run away without cause. He confirms 
the secret vows, bequeaths the degrees, and sells them 
again; and all in all, he has never been serious in this 
matter, but plays with it according to his liking, makes 
laws as much as he wants to trick the others with, but he 
judges without law, according to his own will. 


no conceit. But it is all the devil's trumpery, who would 
gladly deny even the earth, air and water to the marriage 
state. Thus marriage in the papacy stands on one side 
condemned and forbidden, as in the case of the 
spiritless; on the other side permitted, as in the case of 
the secular, but still so confused with laws, cords, 
consciences, and rulings that it is almost as much as a 
forbidden thing, or at least as a dangerous monster. 

Now, without this, marriage is sufficiently confused by 
the devil's business, and strange, whimsical cases occur 
within it, that it would not be necessary to first help with 
dangerous laws and erroneous judgments, but rather it 
would be necessary to have certain and safe laws in 
such large, extensive trade, so that one does not create 
even more unnecessary danger and confusion, but that 
those who commit too much of their own could pay for it 
as quickly and as quickly as possible. For it is impossible 
that one should make laws for all cases, if new cases 
arise daily. But this could happen, that no law would be 
made nor tolerated, which would confuse the conscience 
without cause, or would push into danger of unchastity 
without cause, as the Pope's laws do a lot. 

Accordingly, | like the secular laws much better than 
the more correct ones, and they do not give so many 
ropes and causes for some erroneous cases and care. 
And whoever takes or has a legitimate wife according to 
such laws, a priest can say and judge with a happy heart 
that he has it with a good conscience, with God and 
honor. For the gospel teaches us to honor and keep 
worldly rights wherever we are or wherever we go, as 
Paul clearly says in Romans 13:1: "The authorities, 
which are everywhere, are ordered by God, and 
everyone should be subject to his authorities. But you 
will find all this and much more in this fine booklet, which 
has been compiled from the laws with great diligence. 

7 But see to it that you are also grateful for such 
knowledge, and do not seek carnal freedom as a cover 
of shame. For many have now become so ungrateful, 
and seek their will to be brave under the freedom and 
achievement of the flesh.

They know the truth, that they are not only worthy to be 
under the pope's laws and to torture themselves, but 
they should live under the devil's laws. To such also the 
1) Gospel does not apply, to such also one does not 
write, to such also one does not allow any freedom of 
the Gospel. But if they take it themselves and use it for 
their will, the devil will certainly bless them. For it is 
written: "God will not leave unpunished the one who 
abuses His name" [Exodus 20:7, Leviticus 24:16].

gifts, can rejoice when

divine gift and gift, by the imperial rights added and given

heart can never do, but is the devil's sow, who wallow 
and graze in such divine works and gifts, as in a mud 
and dung. But may God, who has enlightened us 
through His holy Word, also strengthen us and keep us 
in the same, whom we may praise and thank from our 
hearts forever for His unspeakable gifts and goods.

February 1532. 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


Preface by Martin Luther on the sermons of 
Herr Brenz. 


Although all instruction and reminder is in vain with 
hardened people, as Isaiah also complains [Cap. 1, 5.) 
complains that the stubborn people are beaten by the 
Lord in vain, we who are in the teaching ministry must 
not cease to teach and exhort, just as Jeremiah did not 
cease, although he saw that he could not do anything 
with the stubborn Jews until they experienced in reality 
what the prophet threatened. Therefore, | like these 
admonishing sermons of Johann Brenz very much, and 
| considered them worthy of being published, so that 
through them (which God may give) some may be led to 
repentance. For this is what necessity compels us to 
confess, 





that both Brenz and all of us would like to advise the 
perishing Germany, although | fear that our efforts will 
be in vain, and that those obdurate and stubborn people 
will shortly confirm our prophecy of future misfortune, 
which they now ridicule or surely despise, and sing the 
well-known shameful penitential song: | would not have 
meant that, | would not have believed that! 

They have already learned from us, 3) that one 
should honor the authorities, since God has ordained 
them, and because we have fortified and comforted the 
hearts of our people against the Turk and sedition, they 
trust in it and are as secure as if there were no danger 
left anywhere, and as if the Turk

At the end: Vitebergae per loannem Weiss. Anno M.D.XXXII. mense Februa. As early as 1532, a German translation appeared in

would have to be afraid of them. But this is not what we 
have intended with our consolations, that we should free 
the unrighteous and the courageous from all fear and 
make them completely safe. For it is not enough that you 
know that you are celebrating in a good state, which God 
approves of, but God also requires of you that you serve 
Him in fear and humility. And he has not placed you in 
your state in such a way that you should enjoy it 
securely, but as it says in the second Psalm [v. 10. f.]: 
"Let yourselves therefore be instructed, O kings, and 
serve the LORD with fear." Therefore he would have you 
fear him; if you do not, he will not care for your station, 
however holy and godly it may be, but will overthrow you, 
as follows in the same Psalm, v. 12: "Lest he be angry, 
and ye perish in the way." 

| fear, indeed, that if the Turk breaks into Germany 
again (which is reported to be certain), he will plague us 
severely. For we Germans are not the only ones who do 
not repent.

because of our exceedingly grave sins, but the nearer 
the enemy is, the more shameful and licentious and 
safer we even live. Therefore, there is danger that God 
will impose heavy punishments on us Germans for such 
great sins, which we will suffer in a short time to unferem 
fehr great harm. But what else can happen? We have 
been admonished enough, we have been told, written, 
painted and sung enough beforehand what we should 
do and what we should refrain from doing. Therefore, 
there is nothing left (since it must come to pass) but for 
God to tear out His Lot and let Sodom and Gomorrah 
experience what they neither believe nor want to hear 
now that it is foretold. We servants of the Word are 
excused. Let the blood of each one be upon his head. | 
recommend this booklet to all godly Christians that they 
read it diligently. 

May the God of grace have mercy on us in Christ and 
not reward us according to our merit. Amen.

Grace and peace in Christ our Lord, who has become

of all of us, who are the most miserable sinners, through 
his inexpressible love. My dear friend! It pleases me very 
much your undertaking (of which | learned quite late) to 
publish some books of St. Athanasius, namely of the 
Trinity,

among which the conversation or disputation gave me 
extraordinary pleasure, which, as is known, was held 
under Constantine the Great before the judge Probus 1) 
between Athanasius and Arius. For | was delighted by 
the fond memory, as | remembered with how great fervor 
of faith and applause | had read this discussion as a 
young man in the first year of my monastic state, since 
my monastery preceptor at Erfurt, a truly good man, and 
no doubt a true Christian in the damned habit, had given 
it to me to read, which he had copied with his hand. But 


this was only for me (privata) an amusement and a 
benefit. 

But the other [pleasure and benefit] is that | see that 
the Spirit of Christ is diligently working this in you and 
through you, that this article of the Trinity be preserved 
and defended pure and whole in the Church of God, for 
the preservation of which that exceedingly holy man 
Athanasius had no hesitation in unloading from himself 
whatever evil spirits were in hell, in the world, and in the 
whole kingdom of the devil. Therefore, dear 
Pomeranian, your action is a good and salutary one in 
this exceedingly corrupt age of ours, in which all articles 
of faith are being attacked by the servants of Satan, and 
especially that of the Trinity is beginning to be very 
confidently ridiculed by some skeptics and Epicurians. 
They are not only helped by those French grammarians 
or nede artists (as they make themselves believe).

devouring and serving to ungodliness, at which they 
laugh and are so happy among their own that one can

any French and German monsters we oppose the man 
who said to this our servant JEsus Christ [Ps. 2, 7.]: "You 
are my son", and again jHs. 110, 1.]: "Sit at my right 
hand." Let us wait and see what triumphs these 
sneezers will achieve in this great battle against GOD. 
This war of the giants is not new, and he did not strike 
down one Enceladus or Typhoeus, or once or only at 
one time, but from the beginning of the world this our 
Servant JEsus Christ has done nothing else than to cast 
down giants, and will not desist until he has once for all 
destroyed both the seed and the root (as Isaiah [Cap. 5, 
24.]), has destroyed all giants with stump and stem, 
which we expect every day, and pray that it may be done 
shortly, Amen. Fare well in Christo and pray for me. The 
grace of this weak God and servant be with you, Amen.

26) Preface from the book of Aegidius Fader: Of the false blood and idol in 
Schwerin Cathedral, 


1533. 


Preface by D. Martini Luther. 


1. This booklet of your false blood and idolatry in the 
cathedral of Schwerin | have let go out in praise and 
thanks to the true God and His dear pure Word; but to 
shame and revenge on the father of all lies, who has so 
brazenly and shamefully established such and other 
countless abominable  idolatries, and thereby 
suppressed God's word and destroyed Christ's kingdom, 
that he well deserves that we, together with all the 
saints, confidently expose his butt, and put his shame in 
the public light before all the world, so that he may be 
paid twofold, as Revelation Cap. 18:6, that is, to be 
disgraced more and more, just as he has disgraced 
Christ our Lord without ceasing until now, and has 
heaped and multiplied one idolatry upon another in his 
kingdom. 

2. And although the papists now receive many such 
books of their idolatrous abominations and lies, and yet 
insolently and knowingly, in addition, want to remain 
willfully hardened and obdurate in their blasphemous, 
diabolical nature, that it is in vain to consider what we 
may further and further reproach and punish, implore 
and admonish them: we must think and do as the 
prophets did and acted with their people, who were also 
so stiff-necked and stubborn that God Himself said of 
them, "Let their neck be iron and their head brass. 


1) Walch and the Erlanger: would have to. 





The sweat filled the ears of the others and moved their 
hearts to fear God, even though the stubborn and 
obstinate remained unrepentant and unreformed. Just 
as one must confidently preach and cast at the devil, 
although all blows are lost on him, and he drives the 
mockery out of all preaching, as Job paints the 
Behemoth in the 41st chapter, v. 20. 

3. So we must not allow ourselves to be mistaken that 
our papists also have iron necks and brazen heads, and 
do not ask anything about the fact that they have been 
publicly and mightily overcome and convinced with the 
bright truth, but must also beat and throw at them as at 
steel anvils and demons; and although the blows are 
lost, it is still to be hoped that the sound and 
reverberation will fill the ears of some others, and they 
will be frightened by such a strong angry judgment of 
God, and learn to fear God. For it is terrible for a kind- 
hearted person to hear that God strikes hard heads so 
earnestly and with His great thunderbolts, and yet they 
despise and mock all this; And one learns from this how 
terrible it is that God should be so very angry, and not 
only inflict such abominable idolatry and powerful error 
on the devil over the godless and ungrateful, but also so 
completely deliver them into his power that they, 
hardened and blinded, cannot hear nor suffer the word 
that he sends to them as a shell, to save them graciously 
and mercifully from error and the devil's power. 

4 Therefore let every Christian read this booklet, and 
he shall see such divine earnestness and wrath against 
the ungodly, and let it be an example and a warning to 
him to beware and flee to the utmost of his ability. 


*) In 1222, on his return from the Holy Land, Count Heinrich von Schwerin received from a papal legate a shrine, supposedly a drop 
of the blood shed by Christ on the cross, but in fact a piece of cinnabar set in a jasper. This shrine was kept in the cathedral at Schwerin and 
was shown to the people every Friday at a certain hour. It seemed to the onlookers as if the drop of blood separated into three parts, which 
then reunited. That is why this false sanctuary was worshipped for more than three hundred years under great crowd of people. Against this

from such lies and abominations, lest he be made 
partaker of all such plagues, as it is written [Revelation 
18:4], "Come out, come out from Babylon, that ye be not 
partakers of her sin," and drink not with her of the cup of 
the fierce wrath of God, for the day of his wrath is come 
to give her as she hath deserved. May God the Lord 
strengthen us and keep us in His dear, pure Word 
through Jesus Christ our Lord, and help us to gratefully 
acknowledge it and to testify and adorn it with good 
fruits; to Him be praise and thanksgiving forever and 
ever, amen.

false dreams, saith the LORD, and preach the same, 
and deceive my people with their lies, and loose 
theidings, when | have not sent them, neither have | 
commanded them, neither are they of any use to this 
people, saith the LORD."

have not received the love of the truth, that they might 
be saved, therefore God will send them strong delusion, 
that they may believe the lie, that they all may be judged 
who believe not the truth, but have pleasure in 
unrighteousness."

birthplace Vach in Hesse. Now he attacked the Lutheran doctrine fiercely because of doctrine and life. Probably the writing to which Raida's

believe that the Cardinal of Mainz's Tellerlecker, called 
Doctor Toad 1), is said to have put a lot of his poison 
into this booklet, which also once began to whistle a 
dance; and since the whistle was tuned differently than 
he had intended, and he had now ruined the dance, he 
became insane, and became worried that he would also 
be expelled from the Halle Dishlickery, and not find the 
fool at the Cardinal that he is looking for, he would like 
to avenge his wrath, and cool his troubles on us, and 
yet, praise God! he can accomplish nothing. 

(3) And indeed, because the pope together with his 
own have hitherto raged and raged with lies, murders 
and burnings against God and his word, as it befits their 
holiness to bear such figs and grapes, | do not begrudge 
them that our false brothers and poisonous toads run 
away from us and join them; for in such churches such 
saints, like and like, gladly belong. | have long since felt 
a dizziness and a grimace in my body, but now that such 
worms and toads are leaving me below and above, | 
realize what | was missing, and | have become better; 
just hurry out, what does not want to stay, here no one 
holds the other. 

(4) But such an example is good for a warning, that 
one may learn from it what a shameful wretch is the belly 
that makes such peelers and knaves for the sake of 
licking plates, so that one may see that the wise man's 
teaching of Sirach 


1) "Doctor Toad" is Rabianus Crotus. 





is true, since he says Cap. 40, 30. f.: "He who takes 
comfort in a strange table does not think to feed himself 
with honor; he must also sin for the sake of strange food. 
Therefore a sensible, wise man isware of it." Item [P. 
32.]: "Such begging (or plate-licking) is well pleasing to 
the insolent mouth, but at last he will get a nasty fever 
from it." Here they stand finely painted, the lazy rogues, 
who do not want to feed themselves with work, but seek 
their pleasure with hypocrisy, lies and after-talk at the 
tables of the rich, and it is called a life, since they feed 
themselves with sins. Just as the lewd women, and the 


common women's innkeepers, feed on sins. Vide, cibus 


quid facit alienus [See what foreign food does]. 

(5) But | would like to see that both, bishops and 
princes, once order such ass-writers to stop, because 
they know well that such writing has been nothing else 
so far, nor can it be more than blowing into the fire, which 
is now somewhat quenched by the pious Emperor Carol 
and buried in the ashes. If the buntings will be picked up 
again and a lot of wind blown into them, they may wait 
and see whose eyes will be struck by the sparks; if a fire 
also arises from this, then | will be excused; and | will 
have warned them faithfully. We know all too well how 
all their things stand, and our stock is still whole, and we 
still have feathers and ink, whether their skin itches too 
much for us to scratch it. But | advise peace, and may 
the merciful God grant it to us, amen.

28 Preface to the booklet: Account of the Faith, Services and Ceremonies 
of the Brethren in Bohemia and Moravia, *) 153s. 


Preface by D. Martini Luther. 


1. Many times | have asked that the people in 
Bohemia, called the Valdensians or Picards, show me 
their faith clearly and distinctly, so that | might know how 
close or far they are from us, or from the right Christian 
mind, especially because they were condemned and 
proclaimed heretics by the papists, and yet such a 
beautiful, apparent character and serious diligence of 
discipline and good works was found in them, that even 
in our clergy and monks no such thing was to be seen 
or heard. This is true, and our clergy had to confess it 
themselves. 

2. Since | have read much of their writing and books, 
and yet could not understand some of their words and 
speech, which they used in the sacraments and matters 
of faith (for they sounded much different in my ears, 
neither do we speak of them), and | know well that one 
should not quarrel about words and speech, Where 
otherwise sense and opinion do not quarrel against each 
other (every bird sings as it grows its beak, and every 
language has its own way and manner of speaking 
about the matter, as all this may well be found where 
one language is to be interpreted into another), we finally 
came together to speak about it orally. 

(3) And after much discourse, and especially of the 
sacrament of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus 
Christ (in which | had been suspicious of them), | found 
them to our faith. 





1) speak a little differently with words or language for the 
sake of the papists (of transubstantiation and Opus 


operatum), but still basically sanctify with us 2) and 
believe that in the sacrament the true body and blood of 
Christ is received 2c. When | found this piece, | became 
less opposed to their actions, because they did not 
otherwise teach or hold wrongly about the Holy Trinity, 
about Christ, about eternal life, and about all articles of 
faith, and decided, because they remained so close to 
Scripture, that they would have been unfairly called 
heretics, especially by the papists, in whom not bad 
heresy nor error, but vile abomination, and who without 
measure raged much, and all their doctrines not only far 
away, but also radically against the holy Scriptures; as 
we have abundantly proved all this with so many books 
that it is publicly undeniable. 

4 Because | would like to see all the world united with 
us, and we with all the world, in the same faith of Christ, 
least of all, if it could not be done with languages, but 
with the heart and mind, | have sent out this booklet of 
the above-mentioned brothers in Bohemia, so that all 
devout Christians may read and see how near or far we 
are from each other or with each other, whether God, the 
Father of all mercy, through His mercy, is able to give us 
a new life. 


1) "our faith" - relating to our faith. 
2) helligen - to be unanimous. The Wittenberg edition offers: 
unanimously believe. 





*The Bohemian brothers had drawn up a confession of faith in 1532 and presented it to Margrave George of Brandenburg. This was 
translated into German without their will and printed in Zurich. They were so dissatisfied with this translation that they bought up all the copies 
they could get their hands on and got rid of them. Then they had another translation made and printed in Wittenberg. Luther wrote a preface 
to it. It appeared in 1533 under the title: "Recheschafft des Glaubens: der dienst vnd Ceremonien, der Bruder jn Behemen vnd Mehrern, 
welche von etlichen Pickarten, vnd von etlichen Waldenser genannt werden. Together with a useful preface by Doct. Mart. Imth. Do not 
dempffet the spirit, do not despise the prophecy, but test everything and keep the good. Thessalo. v. Wittemberg. M.D.XMiij." 12% quarto 
sheets. At the end: "Printed at Wittemberg by Hans Lufft. M.D.XWij." This writing has been reprinted several times, including at Schleswig in 
1605. Our preface is found in the collections: in the Wittenberger (1559), vol. XII, p. 357d; in the Jenaer (1568), vol. VI, p. Il2P; in the 
Altenburger, vol. VI, p. 121; in the Leipziger, vol. XXII, appendix, p. 108; and in the Erlanger, vol. 63, p. 319.

| pray that he will give his abundant grace to his dear Son, 
our Lord Jesus Christ, so that the divisions and schisms 
may be fewer, and that we may in part come together in 
one mind and spirit, until at last, with one word and one 
manner of speaking, we may equally and unanimously 
praise Christ. For although | do not know how to accept 
the aforementioned brethren's way of speaking, | do not 
want to hurry them again, nor force them to speak 
according to my way, as far as we otherwise become and 
remain one in matters, until God sends further according 
to His will. 

5. For since they have put their doctrine into such a 
method or order, the like of which neither the pope, nor 
all his own, have nor could have (though they would), yet 
we have in our part a brighter and more certain way (I 
praise the worthiness’, and do not praise ourselves) to 
speak of grace and forgiveness of sins, because we 
separate works and faith so purely and correctly from one 
another, and ascribe to each its own kind and office, from 
which piece one can certainly judge and judge from all 
other pieces and doctrines. But where such a correct 
distinction is not kept clear, something of the works that 
are supposed to help the faith always remains mixed in. 

(6) But in this booklet everyone will find that they have 
diligently practiced the Scriptures, and the abominations 
of the Papists (for which they have done much). 


For here you will find nothing of indulgences, purgatory, 
masses for souls, pilgrimages, saints' feasts, caps, 
plates, mass markets, and the like innumerable 
abominations of self-imagined holiness and the doctrine 
of men, which raged and raged in the papacy, trampled 
on and denied the faith and the Scriptures, and burned 
and killed as heretics anyone who did not want to 
blaspheme with them and desecrate God. 

7. Therefore | command this booklet to be read and 
judged by all devout Christians, and | ask that they pray 
with us all together to God our Father for unity of doctrine 
and faith, and if there is anyone who has not been done 
enough in this booklet, let him look at it as they humbly 
ask; and if they do not earn anything else with it, then it 
is still fair that they should be the broken reed and 
smoldering wick, because we are all not yet so whole 
and perfect ourselves. 

(8) But since we do not intend to persecute or destroy 
one another, but to promote and help, let St. Paul be our 
shepherd and mediator, saying Rom. 15:7: "Receive one 
another, as Christ received you, to the praise of God. 
And again Rom. 14, 1: "Receive those who are weak in 
faith," 2c. until everything becomes clear and perfect. 
May the Father of our dear Lord Jesus Christ, the Father 
of all peace and unity, grant us this, blessed and praised 
forever and ever, amen.

because almost the whole crowd has lost God's word in 
their hearts and despises it so miserably, but on the other 
hand clings to the idol Mammon with such diligence and 
runs after him, as if everyone wanted to snatch all the 
world's goods for himself, that one can see how the dear 
word alone still shines a little on the preaching chair, 
through the bodily voice, although the same preaching 
chairs are also few. 

Because we see and grasp how the divine word is 
already extinguished in the hearts, then it is done for a 
little that it also extinguishes on the preaching platform; 
because he who has no heart for it, will not long put his 
ears or mouth to it. But if the preaching stand never 
shines, then the world has what it should have and 
deserves, namely, that it, abandoned and rejected by 
God, is given into the power of the devil, who leads it 
from one error into another, with all kinds of lies, He fills 
them with all kinds of lies, idolatry, heresy, and then 
drives and hunts them to rebellion, war, murder, avarice, 
and all kinds of vice and vice, as Christ says that the cast 
out devil takes over and possesses his former house with 
seven spirits that are worse than he is [Luc. 11, 26.]. 

(3) | say that we must not worry about this alone, but 
we must take care of it as surely as God lives, because 
we can already see the beginning of this calamity so 
powerfully before our eyes, and all the hearts of the great 
crowd are already in it. This is called Sodom and 
Gomorrah sunk with fire and brimstone, this is called the 
world drowned with the flood of sin, this is called 
Jerusalem destroyed, that not one stone is left upon 
another, and there is no hope nor counsel to take away 
or turn back such things (unless it be the last day), for no 
one 


will hear it nor believe it, and if one sings it and says it, it 
is amockery. O right, right, so shall God punish you, you 
desperate world, for your ingratitude and contempt of 
divine word, that you must not be worthy to believe your 
future punishment, which one announces to you so 
vehemently, but before you are sunk into the abyss with 
Sodom and Gomorrah, before you could notice it. 

4 Isaiah Cap. 6, 9. 10. has also proclaimed to you: 
"Go and blind the eyes of this people, and stop up their 
ears, so that they become blind and deaf, and can 
neither see nor hear, and make their heart thick," that is, 
careless, sure and ungrateful, so that they become mad, 
and neither understand nor realize anything, so that they 
do not convert, and | must help them. This text goes on 
and on with violence with the ungrateful people of the 
world. There is no seeing, nor hearing, nor doubting, nor 
correcting, nor converting, therefore the last will certainly 
have to be found, that he will leave them and not help 
them. That is terrible, horrible; but what can we do about 
it? We must let it go and come as it goes and comes, for 
even if we tear ourselves apart and complain of it, the 
world asks nothing of it; it goes on as it is mad and foolish 
and possessed with all devils. Go thy way, thou noble 
and tender fruit, and find what thou seekest, and wilt not 
lack, nor have otherwise; we are easily parted, we 
cannot hold thee; if thou wilt be displeased, we will sing 
with the angels over Babylon, We have long healed 
Babylon, but there is no healing; therefore we let her go, 
and depart. 

5. however, because we have such a plague 


In 1555, he prefaced the second volume of the Jena edition with a short word: enough of the preface to the first volume; however, he wanted 
to put this "exhortation, warning and reminder" of Luther instead of a preface. Where he had taken it from, he did not indicate, and it was also 
not easily recognizable, because he had omitted the last paragraph. Therefore, all later published editions of Luther's writings have taken this 
"Admonition" 2c. for a special writing of Luther and have printed it again "with the preface of Amsdorf", which, however, does not refer to this 
"Admonition" at all, but to the Jena edition. Our preface is found in the Wittenberg (1559), vol. XII, p. 358d; in the Jena (1568), vol. VI, p. 114 
and (instead of the preface to vol. Il) (1585) vol. Il, p. s- iij d; in the Altenburg, vol. VI, p. 122 and vol. Il, p. 1; in the Leipzig, vol. XXII, appendix, 
p. 109 and vol. XXII, appendix, p. 156; in Walch's old edition, vol. XIV, 309 and vol. X, 256; in the Erlanger, vol. 63, p. 324 and vol. 64, p. 262. 
In the Altenburger and the collective editions following it, the "exhortation" 2c. is erroneously reckoned to the year 1522. Since this exhortation, 
which comprises the greater part of our preface, is also found in our edition, Vol. X, 213 ff, we could perhaps have limited ourselves here to 
a correction and addition. But we have preferred to have the preface printed here in its entirety, which is not in the right place there, has a 
misleading title and wrong year, and is incomplete. In the tenth volume, only our preface should have been referred to.

or the last day, and still have the light for a little while (as 
Christ says), we who love the light want to walk in the 
same light as long as we have it, so that we may be 
found children of the light, and when the hour comes that 
our Sodoma and Gomorrah must sink with brimstone 
and fire, we with the pious Lot will be preserved and 
saved, for God knows well (says St. Peter 2 Ep. 2, 2). 
Peter 2. Ep. 2, 9.) how He should save the pious when 
He punishes the unbelieving world. Therefore, let us 
always keep teaching and exhorting one another to faith 
and good works, and let us keep the good light among 
the evil, perverse generation, like the lamps and the star 
of light, and also act as if we did not see or know the 
hostile, ungrateful despisers. 

Accordingly, | have let myself be pleased, 


to bring this booklet of Magister Caspar Aquila to light by 
printing, so that such admonition may help us to remain 
in the dear light; for even if the great lost multitude does 
not respect it, there must still be some of the small group 
who accept it with love and thanksgiving, and thank God 
for it, just as St. Paul, when he had long worked on the 
lost multitude in vain, 1) turns to the elect and says: he 
does everything for the sake of the elect. Let us do 
likewise. For though we would gladly do more for the 
sake of others, yet it will not be, and all is lost. Christ our 
Lord and Savior, keep us, his little company, and be with 
us to the day of his glory and our salvation, and that it 
may soon come, amen, amen.

bundle of the things which in these times of ours, now 
almost twenty years, have been taught, disputed, and

the greatest and indomitable abominations and the 
shameful nature of the most godless worshippers, which 
Satan has introduced into the church against the gospel 
of Christ by powerful errors and lying miracles (as Paul 
[2 Thess. 2, 9. 11.) all too truly predicted) and flooded it 
with them, as a punishment on the unbelieving and 
ungrateful. Perhaps our posterity, warned, mindful of 
their blessedness, and more grateful to God than we 
have been, can henceforth be made more careful and 
diligent in watching out for the persecutions of the devil, 
our adversary, who neither sleeps nor lets up, but rages 
with incredible fury, making the last worse than the first,

as the present state of affairs sufficiently testifies. Or, if 
she does not want to be warned and rushes to her doom 
with her will, then we are without blame; her blood be on 
her head. 

For we, who today are and are called servants of the 
church and confessors of the gospel of Christ, have 
omitted nothing in our work, watch, service, care, prayer, 
etc., which serves to instruct, preserve and defend the 
church, of which we certainly boast in the Lord, whose 
gift is all that we have done, are doing and have. This 
must also be confessed by the adversaries, whether 
they like it or not, the matter itself bears witness to us, 
and their unending hatred and persistent raging, only 
that they do not want to be called the church, what we 
call the church (we will not argue about that now), But 
still they must confess that we have done everything for 
the assembly which we call the church (may they call it 
a synagogue of Satan or any other name), have 
tolerated everything, and for its sake have aroused the 
hatred of the whole world against us. 

This testimony of the enemies is sufficient for us to 
remind our descendants, namely, that they should know 
that we have stood tirelessly, bravely and 
unconquerably for our church (which they call the 
synagogue of Satan), which we, who will perhaps die in 
a short time, leave behind, not of marble or silver, of 
course, but firmly formed, instructed and fortified in 
Christ. They may see to it that they receive the same. 
Not as if we doubted that Christ would preserve his 
bride, whom he has preserved miraculously and 
omnipotently until our times, but lest (as if Satan were 
dead) some should become too sure, who make 
themselves believe that they have promoted the church 
most when they have corrupted it with their best 
counsels (as they thought), and so have not 


(which will remain to her bridegroom for eternity, 
insurmountable against the gates of hell), but also drag 
many others with them to their doom before they mean 
it, as has happened to great men in this decade to our 
great sorrow, and by letting us lament it in vain. 

It is a serious matter with which we are concerned, 
indeed, it is an eternal matter, either to death or to life, 
which is treated in these theses, which must also be 
attacked in the highest fear of God. And though they 
may seem small compared with other things previously 
written by us, yet they are evangelical lumps, which, as 
Christ speaks, must be gathered up, lest they perish, for 
there are in these theses the principal articles of the 
Gospel drawn together into a summa, without which, if 
they be not rightly understood and purely treated, the 
Church of Christ cannot stand. And if it had not existed 
and been preserved by the power of the almighty Son of 
God, who is also man, through them, they would not 
have come to us in any way, but would have been 
extinguished a thousand years ago through the gates of 
hell. 

Therefore, let the Church of God (which it will gladly 
do) take these theses of Philipp Melanchthon 1) as a 
command, and also the remaining descendants (if they 
want), even if it is only for the sake of history. But he who 
hates them, let him hate them anyway; he who perishes, 
let him perish anyway. Christ lives and will reign for all 
eternity, who will give to those who believe in him what 
he has promised, and to the unbelievers what he has 
threatened. To him be glory, amen.

1 | would have liked to see long ago, and still would 
like to see, that a pious, learned man would have taken 
on the books of the saints' lives and stories, which are 
called legends, cleansing them of the uncertain, 
incompetent ones, because many fables and unrhymed 
dreams are mixed in, which are much more highly 
respected and held than the true, good legends. My idle 
nobles, the papists, could well do this, if they were worthy 
before God to do something in the holy church, which 
they almost boast of, and next to the holy scriptures, 
there is no more useful book for Christianity than the dear 
saints' legends, especially those that are pure and 
righteous, as one finds in them quite lovely how they 
believed God's word from the heart and confessed it with 
their mouths, praised it with their deeds and honored and 
confirmed it with their suffering and death. 

2. all these things out of measure comfort and 
strengthen the weak believers, and make even more 
courageous and defiant those who are strong before, 
because where the Scriptures alone are read without 
exemplification, they are not to be believed. 





and histories of the saints. Although the spirit does its 
work abundantly inwardly, it helps greatly when one sees 
or hears the examples of others by heart. Otherwise, a 
weak heart will always think: "Behold, you alone are the 
one who believes and confesses, does and suffers such 
things. Therefore, God Himself describes in the holy 
Scriptures, in addition to the teachings of the dear 
patriarchs and prophets, life, faith, confession and 
suffering, and St. Peter 1 Petr. 5, 9. also comforts the 
Christians with all holy examples and says: "Know that 
the same suffering happens to all your brothers in the 
world", and the Psalter of all Christians who are afflicted 
in spirit is a comforting example. 

3 Thus | have let this confession of the fine, worthy 
man Lazari Spengler go forth, as he, like a true Christian, 
accepted God's Word with earnestness in his life, 
believed sincerely, did great and much with it in deed, 
and now in his departure and death has blessedly 
confessed and confirmed such faith, for comfort and 
strength to all weak Christians, who now have much 
trouble in the world. 


*) Adversaries had accused Lazarus Spengler, syndic of the city of Nuremberg, that he was associated with various dangerous errors. 


Therefore he added his confession of faith to his will. Luther liked it so much that he published it in 1535 and added his preface. The title of 
the book is: "Bekendnis Lazari Spengler weiland Syndici Der Stadt Nurmberg. With preface. D. Mart. Luth. Wittemberg. m.xxxv." 4 quarto 
sheets. At the end: "Gedruckt zu Wittenberg durch Joseph Klug. N.V.XXXV." Selnecker had this confession reprinted in 1582 and also added 
a preface. In the collections, Luther's preface is found: in the Wittenberg (1559), vol. XII, p. 359; in the Jena (1568), vol. VI, p. 307; in the 
Altenburg, vol. VI, p. 468; in the Leipzig, vol. XXII, appendix, p. 114; and in the Erlangen, vol. 63, p. 329.

The people of the Holy Land suffered all kinds of 
suffering and persecution for the faith of Lazari. 

They are almost crying out now, and because they no 
longer have any pious, learned people who want to 
fence and cry out for them, they set up loose boys and 
cry out confidently. But let them cry out, they still have a 
long time to cry out before they cry out again that which 
Luther has sighed out for them with God's grace; and 
this silent confession of the united man (as

shouting? They do not teach, only they shout. So let

1535. 


Preface Martini Luther. 


1 Although it will cause suspicion among dangerous 
judges that | adorn this book of Doctor Urbani Rhegii, 
written against the riffraff at Minster, with my preface, | 
will not allow myself to be challenged, because God has 
placed me in such a way that | must sing my mother's 
little song: To me and to you is no one's mercy, it is both 
our fault. | am the master of one who is able to do what 
the people are perverting, and (as they say) God give 
him what he wills, who is hostile to me without cause. 
For | can well deserve it (praise to God!) and would have 
well deserved it long ago, that the devil and his people 
would have reduced me to ashes here on earth and to 
an eternal fire in hell, even though there is no lack of 
good will on both sides, as they themselves confess and 
show daily. 

2. Moreover, | think that, for the sake of my preface, 
this book will become all the more hostile to Minfter's 
spirits, and will harden and harden them much more, 
because they will think that it is done out of pure revenge 
than by the one whom they have so vehemently shouted 
out through the printing. For so write 





They said that there were two false prophets, the pope 
and Luther. But Luther is worse than the pope. So it goes 
with me: whoever among the pope can make Luther the 
worst of the red spirits that the sun has shone on, has 
got it wrong. Again, whoever can make me a two-faced 
pope among the red spirits, and worse than the pope, 
cannot fail. And yet, if Luther had not written, then no red 
spirit would know what the pope is, and no pope can 
resist some red spirit (without with iniquity, fire and 
sword), but my doctrine is the goal, set by God, to which 
everything must shoot; but the purpose of them all will 
remain hit, and must do vain misses, even over and 
beside the rampart, that everyone must laugh at last, 
who is entitled, as the second Psalm proclaims. 

3 But | must, for the sake of some, if God wills, also 
praise this book in the city of Minster, and command all 
Christian readers; for whoever reads this book and does 
not learn to guard and defend himself from it, will 
certainly either still have a too fresh anger, or finally

be hardened by God. For what more can be advised and 
done, if such great diligence, faithfulness and 
earnestness, in addition to such thorough, certain, public 
truth and writing against such a coarse, foolish (though 
angry and wicked) spirit is so brightly and powerfully 
brought to light and brought to light? And no matter how 
pious they are, and what conscience they have towards 
God, who blame the Lutherans that all such riots and 
sedition come from their teachings, this book (because 
mine do not help so much) shall be a strong and sufficient 
testimony. 

For Doctor Urbanus Rhegius must also be called 
Lutheran, and no pope will be able to do the same, | know 
that well. 1) All their art is: Behold, what good comes from 
the Lutheran doctrine? But where one should be clever 
according to their high art, no devil would have come into 
being where God had not created good angels. For from 
the good angels came the devils, therefore it is God's fault 
that He created good angels. Just as our father Adam also 
blamed God, he would have given him the woman. For if 
God had not created Adam and Heva, they would not 
have sinned; but since Adam and Heva become sinners, 
itis God's fault that such a great sin happened. This is still 
the highest art, and remains the highest art, that only God 
must be a sinner; Adam and his children are all pure, 
pious and holy. 

(5) Therefore, because from Luther's doctrine there 
have come many red spirits (as they say), Luther's 
doctrine must be of the devil. John also says: From us 
they are, but not from ours. Judas came out of Christ's 
disciples, therefore Christ is a devil, and if they also 
wanted to take themselves by the nose, what came out of 
the pope? Then read the histories, what they themselves 
(silent their disciples) also did with the emperors 2c. 


1) Here the Wittenberg edition continues: "But say what you will, it 
is in vain and in vain", then omits everything that follows, and adds the 
conclusion of our preface: "Christ, our dear God" 2c. The piece omitted 
here is used for the preface of the second Wittenberg volume, which 
has the title: "Vorrede D. Martin Luthers vor seinem Abschied 
gestellet." It is reprinted in all editions of Luther's writings, with the 
exception of the Jena edition. The indication of the Erlangen edition, 
vol. 63, p. 407: "Jen. I. 1." is incorrect. 





6 It is obvious that no heretic has ever come from the 
pagans, they have all come from the holy Christian 
church, therefore the church should also file the devil. 
Now the holy church has helped by confessing that the 
heretics who come from it are condemned, and not 
keeping with them; it must not help us Lutherans that we 
also confess, and condemn all the rotten ones (even if 
they do not want to be from us), better than they 
themselves could do. The same happened to the Biblia 
under the pope, which was publicly called a heretic book 
and blamed for the heretics helping themselves from the 
Biblia; as they still do, and cry: Church, Church! against 
and over the Biblia. And Emser, the wise man, 2) did not 
want to know whether it would be advisable to 
Germanize the Biblia; perhaps not even whether it 
should have been written in Hebrew, Greek or Latin, 
because they and the church are so much at odds. 

(7) Since the Bible, which is the Holy Spirit's own special 
book, scripture and word, must suffer from them and be 
defiled as the mother and protector of all heresy, why 
should we not suffer much more that they lay the guilt of 
all heresy upon us? A spider sucks poison from the dear 
rose, in which a little bee finds vain honey; what can she 
do that her sweet honey becomes poison to the spider? 
And great wonder indeed why they do not condemn their 
own corpse; for what good comes from it? He eats and 
drinks the very best, bread, meat, wine, beer, even 
delicious spices, and yet lets from him vile filth, snot, 
saliva, butter, sweat, festering, leaves, grind, gnats, 
rivers, pus, dung and urine. He lets himself be 
wonderfully clothed with silk and gold, and gives off lice, 
nits, fleas and other filth. 

But it goes, as they say: If one wants to the dog, he has 
eaten the leather. Or as the fable Aesopi says much 
more delicately: If the wolf wants to eat the sheep, then 
it has grieved him the water, although the wolf drinks 
above, and the sheep below at the brook. They have 
filled the church with error and blood, with lies and 
murder, yet they have not troubled the waters; we control 
and resist,

Eat, dear wolf, eat, so that soon one leg will remain 
crosswise in your throat. Well, it is the world and its God, 
they cannot do otherwise: "If they have called the 
householder Beelzebub, how much more his servants?" 
[And, must the holy Scriptures be called a heretic book, 
what should our books be honored for?

the holy scriptures, right and true, which so often and 
many times testify to this. Christ, our dear God, Lord and 
Savior, be gracious to us that we do not fall into 
temptation, but keep us pure, blameless, simple, in his 
right faith, and deliver us from all evil, by a blessed 
departure from this pitiful valley, that is, from the 
kingdom of the wicked devil and his world; to whom be 
praise and thanksgiving, with the Father and Holy Spirit 
forever and ever, amen. 


34 Preface to the writing: To the new newspaper of Minster. *) 


1535. 


Martinus Luther. 

Oh, what shall | do, and how shall | write against or 
about these wretched people of Munster? one must 
grasp it on the wall that the devil lives there in the flesh, 
and certainly one devil sits on top of the other, like toads. 
But we should recognize and praise God's great grace 
and mercy in this, that, since we cannot deny how 
Germany deserves a sharp rod through so much 
innocent bloodshed and blasphemy, nevertheless the 
patient Father of all mercy does not yet want to allow the 
devil the right crack, but warns us fatherly, and exhorts 
us to repentance, through such crude devil's play to 
Munster. For there is no doubt in my mind that where 
God would have imposed it, the high, sharp, thousand- 
favored spirit would not have done it so foolishly and 
rudely; but now, prevented by divine power, he must 
play the game, not according to his evil will, but as far as 
it is imposed on him. 

(2) For any spirit that would do harm in the faith will 
not begin by taking wives or husbands, knowing full well 
that the world cannot be deceived by it, because the 
work is public and known to everyone. 





is that there must be either marriage or fornication where 
aman and a woman are with each other; and if it should 
happen, as it did with the Turk and at Munster, that no 
marriage is kept up, then damage is done to the heathen 
or to your worldly government. But the kingdom of Christ 
must be attacked by other means. So also, whichever 
spirit wants to deceive the world, he must not reach for 
royal honors and sword, and want to choke and devour 
the people. For that is too coarse, and everyone notices 
that he wants to exalt himself, and to press everyone; but 
this belongs to it: to put on a gray skirt, to see sourly, to 
fast, to hang one's head, not to take money, not to eat 
meat, to regard wives as poison, to hold worldly rule 
condemnably, to throw away the sword and to leave rule 
2c., and so henceforth to stoop masterly after the crown, 
sword and keys, until one steals them away. 

3 That is what it would like to do; it can also deceive wise, 
spiritual people; it would be a beautiful devil, and would 
have finer feathers than neither peacock nor pheasant. 
But to reach so brazenly for the crown, and take not only 
a wife in marriage, but as much as lust and folly wills, ah, 
that is either a

young ABC-devil or Schutteuflein, who cannot yet spell 
properly, or, if it is the right, learned devil, then the 
gracious God has certainly bound him with such strong 
chains, that he can not make it more nimble nor more 
subtle nor must to threaten and warn us all, that we 
should fear his punishment, before he gives the same 
learned devil air and space to attack us not with the ABC, 
but with the right heavy text. For if he does this, if he has 
to be a grammatical devil, what can he do if he could be 
a reasonable, wise, learned, legal, theological devil! 

Therefore, there is no great need for this spirit, and | 
do not think that all the citizens of Minster are pleased 
with such nobility, who are now silent, and have to shirk, 
and secretly sigh to God from the bottom of their hearts 
and cry out: Oh save, save, save! Is there no one who 
wants to save, just as in the Munchian uprising many 
innocent people had to join in and remain silent, who 
would much rather have been saved, and would gladly 
have seen the salvation. And if God wanted that the 
wretched devil in the whole world would not have to be 
smarter nor more subtle than he is at Munster, provided 
that the dear Christ would keep us Christians in his 
knowledge, then (whether God wills it) few people would 
let such coarse spirit, or the subtle spirit coarse pieces 
move. 

5 However, when God is angry and takes away His 
word, no error is so gross that the devil passes through 
it. For Mahomet's beginning was also gross enough; but 
because God's word was not there, such a shameful 
empire still came out of it, as we see. If the coiner had 
also been lucky, and God had been ungracious to us, it 
would have been just as much a Turkish empire as 
Mahomet's; and in sum, there is no spark so small when 
God is angry and wants to let the devil blow into it, it can 
become a fire that consumes the world and no man can 
extinguish. The best way to defend ourselves is with the 
sword of the spirit, to defend ourselves with the word of 
God; for the devil is a spirit, and does not ask for armor, 
horse or man. But it is not to be said to our lords, bishops 
and princes that they let preach, and first tear the hearts 
from the devil by God's word, but 





They want to strangle everything, take the body from the 
devil and leave the hearts to him. They will succeed, just 
like the Jews, who wanted to destroy Christ with 
strangulation. 

6 Although | gladly believe these new newspapers to 
be true, |am much more moved by the obscene writings 
they have sent out to Munster, in which they paint 
themselves more clearly, even more shamefully, than 
any new newspaper can do. First of all, contrary to the 
faith, they teach clumsily about the birth of Christ; as if 
Christ should not come from Mary's seed (as they call it), 
and yet be David's seed. But they do not interpret it 
clearly as they mean it, and here the devil has a hot 
porridge in his mouth, and speaks mum; perhaps he 
would like to say something nasty, but he kicks out so far 
that Mary seed or flesh could not redeem us. 

(7) But spi and mum, devil, what you can, the little 
word "born" overturns all this. For all the world in all 
languages is called born, since flesh and blood comes 
through the female body as a child, and is called nothing 
born, except what is brought to the world grown by the 
mother's body and blood. 

Now the Scriptures everywhere call Christ born of 
Mary his mother and her firstborn son, and Isaiah: "A 
child is born to us. And Gabriel: "That is born in thee" 2c. 
And again, "Behold, thou shalt conceive" 2c. Dearly 
beloved, to be with child is not to be a tube through which 
water passes, as Manichaeus also blasphemed Christ, 
but to be taken from the mother's flesh and blood, to be 
nourished, to be grown, and then to be brought into the 
world after the manner of a woman's womb. 

(9) After this, that they condemn baptism, which was 
given before, and make it a heathen thing, is gross 
enough; for they look upon baptism as a work of man, 
and not a divine ordinance. If then all that the ungodly 
have and give is nothing, | wonder why they do not 
consider the gold, silver and other goods of Minster, 
taken from the ungodly, to be nothing, and make other 
gold and silver, when baptism is as much God's work 
and business as silver and gold; and so God's baptism 
is nothing.

355 





If the wicked have the right gold and silver, why can they 
not also have the right baptism, gospel and sacrament? 
Item, if the wicked swears, he has and abuses the right 
name of God, if it is not the right name of God, then he 
does not swear unjustly. If a murderer robs, murders and 
steals, he has the right commandment of God, against 
which he acts; if it is not the right commandment of God, 
he does not do wrong. So here also: If the previous 
baptism was nothing, they did not do wrong by being 
baptized; why then do they curse such baptism as 
blasphemy, if it is nothing? as they say. 

(10) But there the devil is a master, to take hold of 
worldly things, and to break up the former marriage, and 
call it fornication. Now tell me: because they themselves 
boast about the previous marriage 





If they are vain fornicators, they must all be vain 
fornicators; but if they are fornicators, why do they inherit 
and possess the goods of the city and ancestors? They 
should leave the goods, which they themselves call 
whore goods, and consider themselves no heirs, and 
seek or acquire other goods of their own in their new 
marriage, which would not be whore goods, but marital 
honest goods. It is bad for such holy people that they 
feed on whores' goods, and in addition take the poor 
whores and boys (their ancestors) so murderously and 
shamefully. 

Your dodder kingdom or rat kingdom is so grossly 
inflammatory that it is not necessary to speak of it, and 
indeed | have already spoken of it here too much and 
without need, and others have already moved it enough, 
so | will leave it alone this time.

child, about which | would very much like to have your 
correct and dry judgment (as you are used to do in such 
matters and are inclined to do). For where it would have 
happened in this way, it still made me wonder; although 
there may not be much questioning as to who he is, the 
journeyman, but what he means by wanting to become 
so grainy, and comes as surely as if he had been 
grained. 

2. and without doubt, because Christ himself confesses 
that Beelzebub has a kingdom on earth, such his humble 
legate will not be 


have come without his king's command, and so heartily 
want to confess. For you (along with us) know almost 
well how such a poor sinner has had such great remorse 
and sorrow for his sin ever since the beginning of the 
world, and would gladly do enough for his sin, if God 
would allow him to do so. But God's mercy is too great 
and takes care of the poor, humble sinner; otherwise he 
would fast and mortify himself to death, or do greater 
works, so that he would corrupt himself as a weak, pious, 
silly little spirit. Therefore, he does not want to burden 
such a poor sinner with such repentance, but will do it 
himself once, so that he gets his right absolution, and is 
no longer allowed to do enough for his sin, auras. 

Now it is said piece by piece, and it is valid who will mock 
the other best at the end.

And even if such a ghost had not appeared, we Christians} 
still know what his thoughts are, as St. Paul says. He will 
let my Scheblimini remain, and will not tear it down with 
anger or mockery. For if my heretic booklet (the holy 
scripture) is right, he may bite my Scheblimini in the heels. 
If his head is crushed by the same Scheblimini, then he} 
must not care for mockery to his detriment. Then we will 
not confess to him (as he does), but from the judgment 
seat say otherwise, thus: Do this, and die eternally in the 
hellish fire. 

Behold! | wanted to ask you for a judgment and 
interpretation of this ghost, so | would have done it myself; 
please forgive me for that. | did not consider that you are 
the highest and right bishop of the Christian churches in| 
Magdeburg. The Psalter was not available, which with its 
musica would have awakened me to such great majesty) 
of your state, otherwise | would not have been so bold. 
Therefore, | still humbly ask you to give me your opinion 
in writing in these high matters, and to paint the pious| 
confessor as he deserves. But if you wanted to push 
these things home to me again and consider me a pope 
(as | consider you a bishop) (God be unaware of the great 
honor of both of us), then you must realize that bishops 
have often been more learned and more pious, neither 
the popes, nor St. Augustine at Hippon. Alas, a wretched 
bishop! Nevertheless, he was the most learned and best 
of all popes and bishops (even if he was not the holiest of 
all). Not that | am mocking the pious legates, and how 
could | mock such a high spirit, even if | would like to? 

If |, as a pope, would like to answer such a legate in 
earnest, you know that before | gather my cardinals and 
prelates together, they have starved, burned, drowned, 
murdered, chased away, dispersed 2c., that my 
Concilium can be held much less, neither of the Roman 
Pontiff, who could hold it well, if he wanted to, and would 
not have to worry that he would not be so well off, as in 
the Costnitz Concilio the three Popes would have to be 
held on one occasion. 





times. Therefore, it will almost remain with you, as the 
archbishop and ordinario loci or diocesan, what is to be 
done here. 

6 I, who am called a pope (and | am), want to 


commit to you (so that your conscience may act 
safely) plenitudinem potestatis, also the scrinium 
pectoris, that you may absolve such a sinner, as he 
is in articulo mortis, or, as St. Peter says, in 
rudentibus inferni. Petrus says, in rudentibus inferni,

7 In German: God Almighty be hostile to you, and 
never forgive your sin, and cast you into the abyss of 
eternal fire; and |, by command of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
and of the most holy Father Pope Luther the First, deny 
you all the grace of God and eternal life, and hereby cast 
you into hell, which has been prepared for you and your 
king from the foundation of the world, amen. For such 
confession is followed by such absolution, and you know 
that as confession is, so shall be absolution. As that priest 
did, who also had a child confessor before him, the same 
confessed thus: "Know, know, know, know. He kept 
whispering and did not say a word. And the priest, who 
was also not young of the year, soon whistled over his 
head with his hand, and softly with his mouth: "Whistle, 
whistle, whistle! like the hunters whistle to the hounds, 
and let the child confessor go, and said: "As confession 
is, So is absolution. As is prayer, so is incense, said the 
devil himself, as a priest prays in bed Complet, and prays 
himself. 1) 

But let this be a measure of jesting. We know almost 
well that the devil's joke is a serious one for us Christians,

Cat's play is the death of mice. God warns us to pray and 
to diligently adhere to the Gospel daily. For even though 
he may, out of great courage, so boldly oppose our dear 
Lord and make a mockery of Him, it may still happen that 
he himself does not know why God would do such a thing 
to him: and he would just as soon smear himself in his 
cleverness as he smudged himself in paradise, thinking 
that he had now won, but not at all understanding that 
the fruit of the woman should be so short after him and 
crush his head. After that, he also lacked the art. 

(9) If God wants us to pray earnestly and to do God's 
word diligently, he will not want us to do so, even if he 
causes so much trouble and harm; but if we are lazy and 
slothful, it is truly his earnest desire to take our dear 
Christ from us and put him to shame. For he lets it be 
known how great a multitude of kings, princes, bishops 
and clergy he has for himself, and how small a multitude 
our Christ has. It is said in German, Schade wacht; and 
the Gospel says, "The people sleep." Isaiah says, "No 
one believes." Now what you further understand and 
notice in this (since we do not have to struggle with flesh 
and blood), let it show me. 

| do not know of a new newspaper, for your little 
chronicle is becoming more and more true, namely, that 
all popes (that is their star in hell) are always hostile and 
repugnant to the emperors, along with their followers, 
and do such a great miraculous work that | would almost 
become a pope myself. For even if they betray and sell 
the most pious emperors, and set themselves against 
them with the utmost courage, they are not rebellious, 
but the most holy fathers. Christ himself could not do 
such miraculous signs (let alone his prophets and 
apostles), for he had to be called rebellious and die as a 
rebel, even though he had been called to be obedient to 
the emperor. But the pope and his followers betray and 
murder the emperors, and yet they are not rebellious. 
Truly, he is called the most holy one, against whom 





Christ is a poor sinner. And truly such a great miraculous 
sign would make not only Lutherans, but also Turks, vain 
papists. Well, the bath is heated hot enough, whoever it 
is for will have to sweat. | know that for sure. 

Our consolation is our heart and, as St. Paul calls it, 
our conscience's testimony that we have not called the 
devil and the papists to such rages, nor have we 
counseled them, as they themselves abundantly testify 
by deed, and must testify without their thanks. They also 
have souls, for which they will have to answer, which we 
must not carry on our conscience, but can boast on that 
day that their deeds did not please us, and we taught 
against them in the highest way. This is joy, consolation, 
defiance enough, until my Sheblimini come, but let it be 
as God wills, be it mockery or death. Long is not eternal. 
Without doubt, eternity will not be short either. If they 
also have such a testimony of their heart, they will feel it 
and experience it afterwards, as we also hope to 
experience it, and pray that it will happen soon, amen. 


True history, happened at Staffort. 


| Laurentius Déner, pastor of StaBfort, publicly 
confess before everyone by my true words and by the 
highest truth: that in the year 1534 on the evening of the 
birth of Christ, our Savior, this history happened in 
confessional manner, as follows, and thus truly 
happened. 

(2) On the evening of the Nativity, after Vespers, | sat 
in confession in the choir in the parish church at StaBfort, 
and instructed the people in the faith, who wanted to go 
to the reverend Sacrament on the morning of Christmas 
Day. And when | had heard them all, and had given 
instruction according to my ability, with God's help, and 
got up, and was willing to go to my dwelling, and saw no 
one else who wanted to go to confession, one came at 
the last, a simple man, according to my liking, but in his 
skin a real rogue, dressed in a black, evil skirt, and had 
an evil hat on his head, and pulled the hat down before 
the

Eyes, and stepped to me from the chair, and spoke to 
me with strong words: 

3. Lord, will you also hear me confess? | answered: 
Yes, tell me. And he kneeled on the ground, and sat from 
me about two paces. | said unto him, If thou wilt confess, 
thou must come near unto me, that | may hear thee, 
what is thy affliction. He answered, "If he were near 
enough, | would hear what he said to me. 

4th And began, and asked me, Lord, what think ye of 
the birth of Christ? | answered: | think much of it. For, as 
the Scriptures show us, by his incarnation, birth, 
suffering and resurrection, he saved us and redeemed 
us from eternal death and damnation. He further asked 
what | thought of his birth and where he was born. | 
answered that he was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and 
born of Mary of virgins, according to the confession of 
our Christian faith, and according to the instruction of the 
Holy Scriptures. He further asked: Where is it written that 
he was born of a virgin? | answered: The prophets and 
evangelists testify that she is a virgin, as Isaiah on the 
seventh, v. 14, Matth. on the first, v. 23, and St. Lucas 
on the first, v. 27. To this he answered me mockingly 
and said: Yes, it may be written there, but | do not really 
understand the Scriptures. 

5 And asked further: As | understand the saying Is. 7, 
14, so it is written in the Hebrew text: Alma; and what 
does Alma mean in German? | answered: It means a 
maid or a young woman who still wears a wreath and is 
undefiled. Which Christians do not think and believe 
otherwise than that she is the pure, undefiled maiden 
Mary, from whom Christ our Lord and Savior was born. 
He answered: This is a lie, it may well be a whore, since 
your Christ was born of her. To this | answered: You 
cannot yet make this true to anyone in eternity. And he 
asked me further, saying, What more do | think of Christ, 
and why he was crucified? | answered, He was crucified, 
and died for our sins, and through our sins was born. 





His death delivered us from eternal death, from sin, from 
the devil, and from hell. To this he answered: No. He 
died because of his sin, because he was a transgressor 
of the law of Moses. | answered: This is a lie of the 
highest order. For he has never committed any sin; he 
came as the true Lamb of God and took away the sin of 
the world. 

6th Then he began, and said, | walked in the field, 
and saw heaven open; and Moses looked down from 
heaven, and stretched forth his horns out of heaven; and 
on one horn of Moses hung your Christ. And Moses was 
wroth, and cast Christ from the horn to the earth; and the 
Jews took him, and for his transgression against the law 
of Moses crucified him, and killed him: and upon the 
other horn sat the man that gave Adam and Eve of the 
apple to eat in paradise; and asked me thrice, saying: 
Do you know this man? Who was he? Then | was 
frightened and answered, "It was the devil. He answered 
nothing; he was silent. 

007 Then said | unto him: Why hast thou denied 
Christ, and destroyed, and profaned, and blasphemed 
him? And all these words which thou hast spoken are 
lies. The devil himself confessed that Christ is the Son 
of God. He asked: Where is this written? | answered, 
Luke in the fourth and more places in the holy Gospel; 
when [v. 33], "the man that was possessed in the 
synagogue with an unclean devil cried with a loud voice, 
saying, Stop, what have we to do with thee, Jesus of 
Nazareth, thou art come to destroy us. | Know who you 
are, namely, the holy Son of God". Further there [Luc. 4, 
41.]: "The devils also went out from many, crying out and 
saying: Thou art the Christ, the Son of God." 

(8) To these words he answered, "It may well be that 
it is written there. The devil did not mean these words, 
nor has he ever been serious about telling Chri-

stum took him for God's son. At that time he had a good 
inn, which he did not like to leave, so he gave him good 
words and called him the Son of God. Summa 
Summarum, he completely denied Christ, that Christ had 
done nothing for us for the salvation of our souls. At the 
last | said to him: Why then did you come to me? If thou 
wilt confess, confess; and dost thou desire absolution 
from thy sin and unbelief, and to receive in a right faith 
the holy sacrament for the remission of thy sin? He 
answered: he does not ask for any absolution, nor for 
any sacrament. He would not know what they served 
him for, nor would he know how to produce much fruit 
with them. 





009 Then said | unto him, Depart thou whither thou 
goest. And he said: | will do it, and in the morning we will 
speak of it in another way. And | said, Do so boldly, and 
come again. Then he got up from me and stank horribly. 
But where he went, God knows, and who he was is well 
known to God. But according to his promise he did not 
return. | do not desire him either. This history happened 
in the year and day as reported above. God Almighty, 
through Jesus Christ our Saviour, protect us from the 
devil and his seduction, and keep us by his grace in his 
holy word until our end, amen.

1535. 


One can see and grasp (God help us!) how important 
it is that one diligently and earnestly adheres to the pure 
doctrine of the Holy Gospel, and daily promotes and 
practices the same. 1. For as St.. Peter faithfully warns 
us that the devil, our enemy, goes about seeking whom 
he may devour, so (unfortunately!) we experience it daily 
before our ears and eyes. There fall in all kinds of evil 
spirits, which devour many souls. Here celebrates the 
lies of the Antichrist and the 


1) In the editions: the same. 


Nor does murder, and kills many souls. There are also 
many among us who have become so lazy and sure that 
they think they cannot lack, and have eaten up hell with 
all the devils. Do not see how they, hurried by the devil, 
are already completely drowned in hope, envy, avarice, 
in addition in unbelief and all ingratitude against God and 
man, full to the top and overwhelmed, so that they, as it 
were full and tired of the gospel, get an itch in their ears, 
have become lascivious, to do something.

*Antonius Corvinus (Rabe) was born in 1501 in the monastery of 





Paderborn in Marburg. He was a Ciftercienfer monk in the monastery 


at Riddagshausen in Brunswick, but was expelled from the monastery in 1522 because of his evangelical views. He then went to Wittenberg, 
became a preacher in Goslar in 1528 and pastor at Witzenhausen in Hesse in 1538. In 1542 he became court preacher of Brunswick- 
LUneburg, general superintendent and reformer in the principality of Calenberg. Because he opposed the Interim, he was imprisoned for 
three years and died in Hanover on April 5, 1553. The text to which Luther wrote this preface is entitled: "Kurze Auslegung der Euangelien, 
so auf die Sontag, vom Advent bi auf Ostern geprediget werden. For the poor pastors and house fathers, prepared by Antonium Corninum. 
In 1536, an edition of this interpretation of the Gospels appeared in Magdeburg in Low German. Under a similar title, Corvinus also published 
an interpretation of the Epistles in 1537. Both were then published together in Wittenberg under the title: "Knrtze vnd einseitige Auslegung

To hear other and new things. Can also be ready judges 
and masters of Christ and the Holy Spirit Himself. 


The devil has already eaten such before they have 
become aware of it. God still protects the rest of us and 
helps us to resist him firmly in faith (as St. Peter says). 
But how will or can faith remain firm if God's word is not 
ceaselessly pursued with speaking, singing, doubting, 
and in various ways? for where the word ceases, faith 
falls, which cannot be nor remain without the word. 
Therefore, because St. Peter tells us to be firm in faith, 
he undoubtedly wants us to be diligent and constant in 
the Word, as St. Paul also teaches his disciple Timothy: 
"Stop reading" 2c. And again, "Stop preaching" 2c., for 
the time is coming when they will not suffer sound 
doctrine, but will itch their ears and bring upon 
themselves many new teachers. We see such things 
ready every day in the mighty beginning. What do you 
think the end will be? 





For this reason, | like these postilions of Mr. Antonii 
Corvini very much, that they remain so short and finely 
pure with the Gospel, and | consider them useful, where 
they would also be read to the people word for word. For 
the common man must have such a clear and short 
interpretation 1) if he is to retain something of the 
Gospel; and | would like someone to interpret the 
epistles briefly in this way. If the lazy pastors did not want 
to study them, or the clever ones prove their mastery, 
good, pious pastors would have enough to preach to 
their people every year, and the churches would be 
abundantly and well supplied with sermons throughout 
the year, so that they would not have to complain that 
nothing or not much was preached to them. Well then, 
whoever wants to hear can learn enough through such 
our ministry; whoever does not want to, let him go and 
let his ears be scratched until the tickling becomes 
painful. Christ our Lord be with us and with all his own, 
amen.

37a, Preface to the Confession of the Brethren in Bohemia. *) 


Delivered to King Ferdinand at Vienna on November 14, 1835, printed in 1538. 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


Although these brethren, who have their being in 
Bohemia and Moravia, have made their confession and 
their doctrine known better and more learnedly than that 
they should need my recommendation or preface, it has 
nevertheless seemed valid to me, since they have now 
for many years been called by the hateful name of Picar. 


or heretics and schismatics, to serve them also with my 
testimony as much as | am able, if my testimony is 
otherwise valid, especially with ours and with all those 2) 
who are devoted to true godliness. 


2) Instead of omnis we have assumed omnes. 


*On November 14, 1535, the Bohemian and Moravian brethren presented a confession of faith to King Ferdinand at Vienna, which was 


more complete than the previous one of 1532 (No. 28, Col. 334 in this volume). In the following year, they sent deputies with a letter to Luther, 
dated Sunday after All Saints' Day (Nov. 4, 1536), to obtain his judgment on it. He liked it so much that when they had it printed in Wittenberg 
in 1538, he wrote a preface to it. The title is: Confessio Fidei ac Religionis Baronum A.c Nobilium Regni Bohoemiae, Serenissimo 
ac Inuictissimo Romanorum, Bohoemiae etc.. Regi, Viennae Austriae, sub anno Domini 1535. oblata. Actorum 24. Confiteor 
autem hoc tibi, quod iuxta viam, quam vocant haeresim, sic colo patrium Deum, credens omnibus, quae in lege et Prophetis 
scripta sunt. Quart. At the end: IVitebsrAae In ollminu Oeor‘i Itlinvv. To this edition, as well as to one published after it in 1542, the earlier 
Confession is appended as an apologia. A third edition was published in 1558 by the well-known Petrus Paulus Vergerius, who added Luther's 
preface and his own. Later, this Confession was reprinted several times in Latin, also included in the Oorpns 6t svntaAlnu 6onk688ionurn 
6661, edition of 1612, xur8 I, x 217, but without Luther's preface. In the following period over-

make an effort. For what the papists think of me, this 
kind of people, who have long been hardened and have 
broken senses [1 Tim. 6, 5.], and, as Paul again says, 
sin, as those who by themselves and willingly bring 
condemnation upon themselves, what should that 
concern me? | am crucified to them, and they are 
crucified to me. 

Admittedly, since | was a pope, | was indeed an 
exceedingly vehement zealot for the Roman traditions 
(for those who are now papists and write against us are 
not serious, as | was, but are quite cold and do what they 
do either out of hatred or out of a desire for gain, and 
would do the same against the papacy, if they could 
hope for riches and greater honor with us), - I, | say, 
since | was a pope, in truth and from the heart hated 
these picards, the brothers, out of great zeal for God and 
religion, completely without any desire for profit or honor. 

Yes, once | had come across some books of John 
Hus by accident, and saw that the writing was so 
powerful and pure that | began to wonder why the pope 
and the council had burned such a great man, | 
immediately closed the book, frightened, because | 
suspected that there might be poison hidden under the 
honey, by which my simplicity could be poisoned: such 
a violent spell of the papal name and the council ruled 
over me. 

But after it pleased Him who separated me from my 
mother's womb [Gal. 1:15] to reveal to me the child of 
perdition, | consulted the best men | could in many 
disputations with flesh and blood, fearing that the light 
that was in me would be darkness: so much do | dislike 
the light that was in me. 


367 


| trusted myself because of the length, breadth and depth 
of the papal majesty, of which | had hitherto also firmly 
believed that it was governed by the Holy Spirit and could 
not be mistaken, until | gradually became firmer, since 
the papists, as it were like wild waves of the sea (as Jude 
[v. 13] says), foamed their own shame against my light 
skirmishes and preludes. Then | began to hold the pope 
in suspicion and to despise him little by little, and finally, 
since his defenders exposed him through books that are 
more null and void than the nullity itself, even abandoned 
him, to recognize him as the abomination himself, who 
stands there in the holy place. 

Then my heart began to rejoice, and as | looked around 
at all those whom the pope had condemned and 
corrupted as heretics, | praised them as saints and 
martyrs, especially those whose godly writings and 
confessions | could find. Of the others, however, | 
suspected that they either had not been convicted or had 
erred through a case of weakness, which could have 
been forgiven if the papists had wanted to follow the 
advice of Paul, who says [Gal. 6:1]: "If a man is 
overtaken by error, restore him with a gentle spirit, you 
who are spiritual. And look to yourselves, lest you also 
be tempted." But they have followed the rage of Satan 
and have ruled strictly and harshly over the sheep of 
Christ, as Ezekiel [Cap. 34, 4.] speaks, and do not yet 
cease to do so. 

Among them | also met these brothers, whom they called 
Picards, who were now no longer as hateful to me as 
they had been before in my papistry. Finally, | found 
among them the unique and great miraculous thing, 
which was almost unheard of in the church of the pope, 
namely, that they, as much as they could, had human- 


The Bohemian friars saw this confession, drafted it more extensively, and presented it to the Emperor Maximilian II in 1564. This redaction 
was translated into German and appeared in octavo in Wittenberg in 1573. The title is: "Confessio, that is, Confession of the Christian Faith. 
To the most Sublime and Great Roman of Hungary and Behem 2c. King Ferdinand, by the Lords and Knighthood of the Crown of Behem, 
who are attached and related to the pure doctrine in the Christian communities, so called the Behemian Brethren Unity, at Vienna in Austria 
on Nov. 14 in the year 1535 and translated in the year 1564. This confession is also delivered to Emperor Maximiliano the other and King

The brethren in Bohemia put aside the doctrines and 
handled the law of the Lord day and night, and were 
experienced and equipped in the Scriptures, while in the 
papacy even the Magistri nostri completely neglected the 
Scriptures, of which they boasted the title; some of them, 
however, had never even seen the Holy Scriptures with 
their eyes. But it could not happen otherwise [among the 
brethren in Bohemia], since the languages were in 
decline, not only the Greek and Hebrew, but also the 
Latin, than that some passages necessarily remained 
obscure to them. And this fault stuck to them: since they 
wanted to avoid the thorn hedges and swamps of the 
Sophists and the monks, they refrained from all 
cultivation of the sciences; at the same time, they were 
also hindered by their small means, which they acquired 
with their hands' work. 

But now they show themselves much more educated 
and free, not to say also more glorious and better, so that 
| hope that they will not be unpleasant and disagreeable 
to all true Christians, so that we also have to thank God 
and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ most highly, who, 
according to the riches of his glory, commanded that this 
light of his word should shine out of the darkness, 
through which he destroyed death among us anew and 
enlightened life. And we must wish them as well as 
ourselves happiness, that we, who were far from each 
other even among ourselves, now, after the sheath

sake of 


15: 


Translated 


D. Mart. Luther. 

You see, dear reader, that even before our time there 
have always been some godly and holy men in the 
church, who, not daring to express their spirit and 
opinion publicly, were not able to do so. 


The wall of suspicion, by which we appeared to be 
heretics to one another, is broken down and we are 
brought together in one sheepfold under the One 
Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, who is blessed for 
ever and ever, Amen. 

Even if there are some differences in this confession 
of their faith with regard to customs and ceremonies or 
even the celibate state, we should remember that all 
customs and habits of all churches have never been the 
same, nor could they have been. For the ways and 
differences of men, countries, and times do not permit 
this; only the doctrine of faith and life should remain 
inviolate. For this must be one and the same, as Paul 
often reminds us, saying [1 Cor. 1:10], "Lead ye all of 
one speech"; again [Rom. 15:6], "With one mouth praise 
GOD, and the Father of our Lord JEsu Christ." For that 
marriage should be free with them in such a way as with 
us, the circumstances do not permit it with them. In the 
meantime, it is enough that it is permitted to everyone, 
and it is taught and believed that it does not cause sin to 
anyone, and thus everyone's faith and conscience 
remain unharmed. Therefore, | also commend this 
confession of the brethren to all the godly in the Lord, in 
which they will clearly see with how great injustice they 
have been condemned and plagued by the papists up to 
now.

The people of the Church, who were not willing to 
confess, but in their corners, as the Church was then 
driven into the wilderness by the dragon (as Revelation 
12:6J says), wept out their sorrow and groaned for the 
day of visitation.

Newly translated from the Latin. 


Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, an admirable man 
(with such an honorary name St. Jerome adorns him), 
says in the preface to the books of his ecclesiastical 
history (in which he blames the sluggishness of his 
predecessors or the evil times), that he was forced to 
take a new path without guiding footsteps, and hardly 
had a star here and there, which he could follow in 
writing such a great work. If now, at the time closest to 
the old church, or which had its course under the old 
church, ecclesiastical matters have been so _ utterly 
neglected by. If at the time closest to the old church, or 
which had its course under the old church, ecclesiastical 
matters were so neglected by those men (whom we, 
both in spirit and zeal, justly prefer far above us, who are 
descendants), or were lost through the disfavor of the 
times, so that they left behind no history which seemed 
worthy or sufficient to so great a man: with how much 
greater equanimity must we bear the negligence of our 
ancestors, who lived after them in a much more corrupt 
time and under much more unsettled circumstances, 
then were not a little inferior to them in zeal and spirit, so 
that in truth we too have barely a few mutilated 
fragments of histories, but not histories. 

But | believe in the almighty GOD (as our faith 
confesses), without whose counsel and order this (as 
well as everything else) would be 





could not happen. But whether this was done according 
to the advice of the Majesty in her anger or in mercy, it is 
not for me to judge. | would rather it had been done out 
of mercy, but | assume in anger. It was once an act of 
mercy that he hid Moses from the Jews in such a way 
that no man ever found his grave, so that the people, 
who were devoted to idolatry, would not erect a temple 
and altar and worship in that place and finally worship 
Moses as God. But by this salutary mercy little has been 
accomplished, because the godless people invented 
nevertheless instead of the one Moses as many idols as 
they had hills, trees, springs and alleys. Thus, it can be 
considered a mercy that God wanted the history of many 
fathers of the ancient church to be lost, so that we also 
have no knowledge of the apostles themselves (except 
in the book of the Acts of the Apostles), what happened 
to them, from any history with certain truth, so that we do 
not, with Christ aside, admire the greatness of the saints 
too much and worship them. But even this advice was of 
no avail, since, Satan having persuaded us to the 
contrary, we have invented so many services of the 
saints that we have at last served even subordinate 
saints, namely the 





*Robert Barns (called Antonius while studying in Wittenberg) was professor of theology in England and chaplain to King Henry VIII. 
Because he would not submit to the six papist doctrines established by his master in 1539, transubstantiation, communion under one form, 
priestly celibacy, monastic vows of silence, and auricular confession, he was condemned as a heretic by Parliament and burned with five 
companions in London on June 30, 1540. He wrote a book under the title: Vitae Romanorum Pontificum, quos Papas vocamus 
diligenter et fideliter collectae per D. Doctorem R. Barns. Ut tempore suo reveletur. 2Thess. Il. Witebergae. M.DXXXVI. 
quarto. At the end: Imprint Vitebergae apud losephum Clug. An. Do. M.D.XXXVI.. It contains "the history of Peter and the biographies 
of the popes up to Alexander III. He dedicated it to King Henry VIII of England in a dedication dated September 10, 1535, in which he praises 
the king for having abolished the tyranny of the pope. Luther wrote a preface to this book. Seckendorf wrote in the Ili8t. Imtli. Incksx Ill in 1536, 
because the original Wittenberg edition is very rare. Walch has had a copy of it in his hands. It is also found in Latin in the Erlangen edition,

subsequently reprinted by the Leipzig edition, vol. XXII, appendix, p. 123 and by Walch. We have newly translated according to the Erlanger.

Catharina, Barbara, Margaretha, Ursula, likewise to 
Christophorns, Georg, Rochius, and many other idols, in 
such a shameful way, that we have made the idolatries 
of the Jews quite gloriously righteous, namely, in that 
God changed the so despised mercy (as we deserved it) 
into terrible fury, as Paul predicted, since he speaks [2 
Thess. 2, 11]: "He will send them strong errors, so that 
they will believe the lie, since they did not want to believe 
the truth." Thus, after Christ had departed, after his 
faithful witnesses had been removed, namely the 
apostles, martyrs, confessors, a new Christ finally 
followed, that is, the Antichrist in the temple of God with 
his new saints, and taught us to worship those whom 
neither our fathers, nor he himself, nor we have known. 
And he has adorned this delicious new deity with 
indulgences, churches, gold, silver, precious stones and 
all precious things, and has distributed the land to the 
worshippers for free, as the Spirit had prophesied in 
Daniel [Cap. 11, 39]. 

To this excess of wrath has been added that we do 
not even have a proper and correct history of this 
monster and new Christ, since his flatterers so honor his 
disgraces and extol his false virtues, raising the painted 
keys and the fictitious ray of banishment in a frightening 
manner. Therefore, he should be held up to us not only 
as the governor of God on earth, but also as a mixture of 
God and man, as it were as a hideous image of the true 
Christ, as a kind of earthly God, who is nevertheless to 
be feared and worshipped above all that is called God 
(as Paul says [2 Thess. 2, 4.)). Namely, the man of sin 
and the child of perdition, who is a worm and rottenness 
(so great is the wrath against the ungrateful world), has 
presumed to sit down in the place of majesty. This might 
not have happened, or might not have happened so 
successfully, if his deeds had been actually and truly 
handed down by some reliable historians, by which godly 
people would have been reminded; however, there is no 
lack of such 





who seem to have smelled the vile stench of this 
diabolical cloaca to some extent; but they have not been 
able to find the body itself and bring it to light. 

It is said of the Turk how abominably he desecrates holy 
places and the relics of the saints; this is indeed 
something unseemly, which should rightly move all the 
godly to pray 1) and act against this raging angel of the 
abyss. But if you compare with this evil the most holy 
sanctity of God's governor on earth, you will see that the 
Turk, as an enemy of the church, desecrates and 
devastates everything bodily, but nevertheless leaves 
everyone free to believe in Christ. But this friend, the new 
bridegroom of the church, sanctifies everything in the 
flesh and preserves it by terrible ordinances, but does 
not allow the freedom to believe in Christ at all, so that it 
is not safe for anyone to even be afraid of it. The Turk 
oppresses the kings and lords of the earth by force and 
arms (as they say) according to martial law, but our new 
God and new Christ, with deceit, with deceitfulness, with 
lies, and all manner of shameful artifices, has always 
afflicted and oppressed the best kings and princes, until 
he has forced them to worship his most holy feet with 
blessed kisses, and to offer their necks for him to tread 
upon. 2) May the cursers of the day curse you, and those 
who are ready to awaken the Leviathan [Job 3:8], Amen. 
At the same time | wanted to pour out this with great 
sorrow of heart and with displeasure, so that | might 
inflame some godly hearts that love Christ to investigate 
(what can also only be investigated) about the papal 
tyranny and the most holy church of the pope. For those 
who have the spirit of Christ have no doubt, but know that 
whatever they read, speak and write against this 
bloodthirsty, blasphemous and god-robbing whore of the 
devil. They offer it to God as the highest and most 
pleasant sacrifice of thanksgiving. | have admittedly in 
the beginning,

Since | was not very knowledgeable, not even familiar 
with the Histories, | attacked the papacy (as they say) a 


priori, that is, from the Scriptures; now | am 
extraordinarily pleased that others do the same a 


posteriori, that is, from the Histories. And | let myself 
think that | am completely triumphant, since | recognize, 
where the light rises, that the histories agree with 
Scripture. For what | have learned and taught, since St. 
Paul and Daniel were my teachers, that the Pope is the 
abominable one of God and of all things, the histories 
shout this to me by deed, and point it out, as it were, with 
the finger, and do not show a kind of 





or subspecies, but the person (individuum) itself, not 


something indeterminate (VagUuM, as they say). 

May our Lord Jesus Christ, who has begun to kill this 
repulsive man of his with the spirit of his mouth, also 
destroy him in the near future by the appearance of his 
future. | say amen, and | wish this with all my heart, and 
| do whatever | can for it, every one who loves the 
kingdom of God and his blessedness. | am not mistaken.

1537. 


| thank God the Father through Jesus Christ our Lord, 
so be it with me, that | have experienced so much, that 
in the pulpit one must now at least preach the text of the 
Gospel and the Epistle more loudly and purely, so that 
the innumerable idolatries, which have been driven into 
the churches by the priesthood, may be driven out daily 
more and more, which is not less, because we should 
daily see many devils approaching through God's Spirit. 
Although the devil defends himself confidently, he rages 
and rumbles almost terribly, both through his lying 
mouths and his tyrants; and as he stirs his dragon's tail 
through the lying mouths, so he also roars terribly 
through his lion's mouth, the tyrants. But still nothing will 
help him. 

For it is no longer written (praise God!) even among 
the papists themselves on the pulpit, how St. Barbara 
helps to the Sacrament, St. Christopher against the 
going 2) death, St. George, St. John, St. John the 
Baptist, St. John the Baptist, St. John the Baptist, St. 
John the Baptist, St. John the Baptist. 


2) Erlanger: "tough". Both the Wittenberg and the Jena have our 
reading. The explanation of the idiom used here is found in Walch,

who are in their last throes." 





in the war, St. Erasmus in the box, and the like holy 
service, brotherhoods, pilgrimages 2c. And those who 
are in awe of Luther can no longer hear such things 
themselves. Nevertheless, everyone now wants to hear 
Christ, regardless of the fact that [it] displeases the 
pope, whom they now fear as much, taught by Luther, 
as the red king in the card game, without what they do 
to annoy us, against their conscience, after they, either 
hardened or come into the no, cannot return with honor. 

| have now been under the pope's spell for twenty 
years, but | have never felt it (praise God!). So the pope 
has also been under my spell for twenty or more years; 
whether he has felt the same, | let them say or remain 
silent, is the same to me. But | am concerned that these 
and similar books show what he has felt, still feels, and 
must feel more. For it is, truly, not to his liking that the 
holy scriptures come to light; for this reason | often wish 
that a short commentary on the gauze Biblia would also 
be made for the preachers, especially in Latin, like the 
good man,

not be to be rejected where it would be improved. 

4 For the end Christ must die, not by the hand of man 
nor by the mouth of man, that is, by the power and 
wisdom of man, but by the Spirit of the mouth of Christ, 
as St. Paul prophesies. But Christ's mouth is his word 
and preaching, as he says Luc. 21, 15.: 1) "I will give you 
mouth and wisdom" 2c., and in the prophet Jeremiah: 
"You shall be my mouth, where you shall divide the 
delicious from the foolish." And to Moses he says, 
"Aaron shall be thy mouth, and thou shalt be Pharaoh's 
God" [Ex. 4:16]. 

5 Therefore let us continue confidently, and bring the 
Scriptures fresh and pure into the pulpit, so that the 
people may know the Lord and Savior.

If we know Jesus Christ rightly and well, then the most 
holy father, with St. Barbara, Catharine, Margaret, and 
also with Veronica, will easily fall without a battle of 
swords, and his great thunderbolt, the terrible ban (as 
the first Psalm says), will become dust that the wind 
scatters, as it stands in the day. For before Luther's time 
no one could have remained a year before the Pabst's 
wrath; now even those who kiss his feet mock him. May 
God, the Father of our dear Lord Jesus Christ, a God of 
truth and Father of all comfort and joy, accomplish the 
work He has begun (as He has also inspired us to ask 
through His Holy Spirit, taught us and commanded us 
through His dear Son), and bring it to a mighty end, for 
the praise and honor of His name, and the blessedness 
of all believers, for the final judgment and punishment of 
the Pabst and his idols, Satan and his angels! Amen, 
amen.

(1) The famous Roman Varro says that the best way 
to teach is to give examples to the word. Otherwise, 
when speech is heard without examples, however just 
and good it may be, it does not move the heart so much, 
is not so clear, and is not so firmly retained. For what 
philosophers, wise men, and the whole of reason can 
teach or conceive that is useful for honest living, history 
gives.

the eyes, as if one were there, and saw it happen, 
everything that the words before by the teaching have 
carried into the ears. There one finds both, how those 
have done, left, lived, so piously and wisely, and how it 
went for them, or how they are rewarded; also again, 
how those have lived, so_ wickedly § and 
incomprehensibly, and how they are paid for it. 

And if you think about it thoroughly, almost all rights, 
arts, good advice, warnings, threats, frights, comforts, 
strengths, lessons, precautions, etc. can be found in the 
histories and stories.

The histories, therefore, are nothing other than an 
indication, memory, and characteristic of divine works 
and judgments, as to how he sustains, governs, hinders, 
promotes, punishes, and honors the world, especially 
mankind, according to whether each deserves evil or 
good. And even though there are many who do not 
recognize or respect God, they still have to take offense 
at the examples and histories, and fear that they too will 
not be like him and him who are presented by the 
histories, by which they are moved harder than if they are 
badly restrained with mere words of law or doctrine, and 
are resisted; As we read not only in the holy Scriptures, 
but also in the pagan books, how they introduce and hold 
forth the ancestors’ examples, words and works, where 
they want to raise something among the people, or when 
they intend to teach, admonish, warn, deter. 

Therefore the historians are the most useful people 
and best teachers, so that they can never be honored, 
praised or thanked enough, and if this should be a work 
of the great lords, as emperors, kings 2c., who diligently 
wrote the histories of their time and preserved them in the 
librae, and who did not incur any expense in keeping and 
educating such people, who were capable of doing so; as 
can be seen, especially in the books of Judges, Kings, 
and Chronicles, that such masters were established and 
kept among the Jewish people; also among the kings of 
Persia, who had such librae in Medes, as can be seen 
from the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. In addition today 
the princes and rulers must have their cancelei, in which 
they set aside and settle their own, both new and old 
things; how much more one should take a history of all, 
or at least of the most daring 1) things, over the whole 
time of their regiment and leave it to the descendants. 

4 And what more do we Germans have to complain 
about than that we do not have the history and examples 
of our ancestors a thousand years ago, and that we know 
almost nothing about where we came from? 


1) because of - important. 





We do not need what we need from the histories of other 
nations, who perhaps need to remember us out of 
necessity rather than in their honor. For since God's work 
proceeds without interruption, as Christ says John 5:17: 
"My Father works until then, and so do |," it cannot be 
lacking that something noteworthy must have happened 
at all times that should be remembered; and even if it 
could not all be read, that the most important pieces 
would be kept in the shortest possible time; as some have 
meant, who have made songs about Dietrich of Bern and 
other giants, and have thereby presented many great 
things briefly and badly. 

5 But it takes an excellent man, who has a lion's 
heart, to write the truth fearlessly. For more than a few 
write in such a way that they gladly keep silent about the 
vices or accidents of their time, for the sake of their 
masters or friends, or interpret them in the best way; in 
turn, they exaggerate minor or trivial virtue; in turn, they 
embellish or embellish the histories out of the favor of 
their homeland and the disfavor of foreigners, according 
to which they love or hate someone. In this way, the 
histories become suspect beyond measure, and God's 
work is shamefully obscured; just as the Greeks are 
blamed, just as the Pope's hypocrites have done in the 
past and still do, and in the end, people do not know what 
to believe. Thus the noble, beautiful, highest use of 
histories is corrupted, and vain washers are made of 
them; which makes that such high work of writing 
histories is free to every one; who then writes and is 
silent, praises and scolds what he thinks good. 

Therefore, this office should be used by high people, 
or by well-appointed people. For since the Histories 
describe nothing but God's work, that is, grace and wrath, 
which must be believed as if they were written in the 
Bible, they should truly be written with the utmost 
diligence, fidelity and truth. But this will not happen now, 
I think, unless the order that existed among the Jews is 
restored. However, we must be content with our histories 
as they are, and at times think and judge for ourselves 
whether the writer was acting out of favor or disfavor.

Martinus Luther, Doctor. 

(1) We must admit, all of us who want to be Christians 
and be saved, that in Christianity there is no rest nor 
cessation of sects, false brothers, and all kinds of 
devilish rages; Satan wants to and must be among the 
children of God, Job at first, v. 6. But where Satan comes 
among them, and gets leave from God and the decree 
to tempt the godly children of God, then it happens that 
the sheep are stolen from dear Job, that the thunder 
strikes his servants to death, that the wind comes from 
midnight and tears down his houses, and strangles all 
his children. But this is not enough; after this his body 
and soul also suffer all manner of affliction, until even his 
own friends afflict him, and his own wife mocks him. 

2. read the Historia ecclesiastica, together with the 
like, and look into it diligently, and you will find how, from 
the beginning of Christianity, there has been such a 
chaos of sects, error, and 


2) There has been all kinds of trouble, that even among 
the heathen, where the devil reigns in the flesh, there 
has been better, quieter and finer government to look 
upon than among the Christians, that the great rulers in 
the Roman Empire have been able to say with mighty 
pretense and glamor: Behold, the boys, how they devour 
themselves among themselves, and yet want to bring 
the world under themselves to their faith. 

(3) Just as Job's friends were so greatly angered by 
his great misfortune, and were sure that Job was the 
worst wicked man on earth, whom God had to be hostile 
to and punish so horribly. And even if God sometimes

have war and suffer all kinds of misfortune among each 
other, they do not consider it so great, nor do they have 
such great annoyance as it has among the Christians, 
who are supposed to be pious, quiet, united and 
peaceful, according to their own teachings and all the 
prophets’ prophecies.

except (whoever can) look to God's word, keep to it, and 
judge everything according to it. For since God's word is 
of great power, that it rumbles and exercises its mighty 
power among devils, death, and sins (who do not suffer 
it, but confidently rage against it), how should it not also 
rumble among the human sects of carnal wisdom and 
holiness, which also cannot suffer it. In such a rumor, of 
course, it must happen that it can be seen as if no one 
could know who is cook or waiter, who is God's or the 
devil's, who is church or end-Christ. 
5 God does all this so that he will not look at men or 
human beings, but at his word, and honor and keep it 
under, above, and apart from everything; so that when 
a man dies or is otherwise in need, he must forget 
heaven and earth, sun and moon, father and mother, 
money and goods, honor and honor.

The only thing they can do is to take hold of God's word, 
dare to do it alone, and thus go there. Heaven and earth 
may remain behind or in front, they can neither advise 
nor help here, nor guide, much less save. 

(6) So, too, in these troubles of the churches, one 
must not pay attention to what people suffer or do, not 
look at whether they are many or few, whether they are 
Turks or Popes, but where and with whom the word of 
God is. There he will stop and be sure that Job's house 
and the children of God, the holy church, are there; then 
let him who does not want to stop be annoyed by the 
works of Satan, who roams so wildly in Job's house that 
it seems to be the devil's house, and all the other houses 
are God's houses. But Job's house remains at last, when 
all the others perish. For it is said, "God's word abideth 
forever." Item, "Heaven and earth pass away, but my 
word does not pass away," Amen. And that is true.

In the book which is called the Decrees of Gratian, many 
splendid things are brought together from the Fathers, 
from which one can see to some extent how exceedingly 
great the difference was between the state of the ancient 
or original church and that of the following ones, 
especially the Roman church, which afterwards, through 
the Iscariothic popes, usurped the name of the universal 
church, if one may otherwise call it a church, which 
dared to erect this blasphemous idol with the most 
insolent brow. But Gratianus was against the popes, 
who even then claimed tyranny in the Church of Christ.

Roman popes (as it seems) in godly opinion, but to an 
exceedingly harmful example. For from then on, the 
pope became so proud that he denied that the rights 
were given to him, and he presumed everything to his 
completely null and void ray of banishment; yes, at last 
his pomposity grew so immeasurably that at this time he 
has broken in two, like his predecessor Judas, and his

abominations, so that the whole earth is his

Stank can no longer bear. So also this epistle of St. 
Jerome, although included among his other works and 
preserved until now, has also been declared invalid, but 
not falsified. For it is too clear and distinct to give 
occasion for any falsification. Although Jerome's 
reputation may not be great in this work, and it may not 
be of any value to the servants of the Roman tyranny, it 
seemed good to us to publish it at this time and to 
present it for special consideration, so that the young 
people, who have no knowledge of past things, have a 
testimony about the condition of the old church against 
the other cold and lame miserable defenders and 
protectors of the Roman whore, who is in no small 
danger because of her cause. 

For here you see that in the time of Jerome (as also 
in that of Ambrose and Augustine) there was no 
archbishop in the Church, no patriarch, no primate, no 
metropolitan, much less a pope or ecumenical bishop, 
but all the bishops were equal among themselves, then 
the bishops the same as the presbyters, and again; 
indeed, he says that the bishop of Eugubium, a little town 
not far from Rome, is equal to the Roman bishop. O what 
a great heretic the holy man would become if he lived 
nowadays, and it is to be wondered that they do not 
condemn him a thousand times to the deepest hell with 
all his writings. It was also the word a common name for 
the bishops. Thus St. Jerome calls St. Augustine the 


most holy papa, and Cyprian they called the papa in the 
church at Carthage. Therefore it is obvious that the 
whole papal hierarchy is man's doctrine, or more 
correctly devil's doctrine, introduced by those who are 
liars in glibness. All (Says St. Jerome) are equal in merit 
and priesthood; the power of wealth and the lowliness of 
poverty make a bishop either higher or lower. 

And what is surprising, at that time the diversity of 
gifts and spiritual graces (to which, after all, the dignity 
of preference or higher position is most often given) 
made it difficult for the people to understand. 


The bishops were not higher bishops. For St. Martin was 
undoubtedly the holiest among the bishops of Gaul, 
famous for his power of the spirit and miracles: yet he 
kept his position among the other bishops, and would 
not heal a sick person unless he was asked and almost 
forced to do so by others. And St. Augustine, who was 
the most learned and eloquent among the bishops of 
Africa, kept his subordinate position, as a younger one, 
and yet he was compelled to teach or speak publicly in 
synods, which would have been granted either to the 
bishop of Carthage, if the dignity of the place had 
mattered, or to some older bishop. These extremely holy 
bishops were indeed what they were called, that is, true 
bishops, who sought not their honor or dignity, but the 
salvation of souls and the benefit of the Church. What 
are our bishops today? Dead larvae and images; and yet 
God wanted them to be only such, and not also vessels 
of God's wrath and anger, to the ruin of the Churches. 

What do you think St. Jerome would have said if he 
had seen today's bishops, archbishops, cardinals? What 
if he had seen the Pope, who not only does not tolerate 
any bishop equal to him, but forces all to submit to him 
as the Lord, who with more than Sicilian tyranny 
oppresses the Church by his pernicious doctrines, who 
robs, steals, extorts the goods of all churches and 
countries with lift, fraud and every kind of lie, who 
tramples on the necks of kings (and Christian kings at 
that), who offers them his feet to kiss, who arrogates to 
himself the twofold sword in the whole world, in pomp 
and splendor surpassing all kings, plaguing the whole 
Christian world with war and turmoil, not only 
disrespecting the word of God, but not knowing anything 
about it, persecuting it, exterminating it, blaspheming 
everything that is Christ, slaughters Christ's sheep, in 
short, who with frightening cruelty and satanic malice 
plays his game with the goods, honors, bodies and souls 
of the faithful, deceives them, ridicules them, mocks 
them and is still insatiably greedy for greater and worse 
things: surely he would have believed, 


386 


Erl. 63, 360-362. 


It is not a man who lives naturally, but Satan who rages 
in the form of a man, and amazed, he would have kept 
silent and wept until death. For he who does not like that 
the bishop of Rome is higher than the bishop of 
Eugubium, dear, what should he find in the pope that he 
did not curse to death? 

And we poor people have been forced to worship all 
these blasphemous and abominable abominations as 
decrees established by divine right, otherwise we would 
incur the wrath of Almighty God and His holy apostles 
Peter and Paul. And it was a more tolerable sin to deny, 
blaspheme and ridicule all the articles of faith (as they 
do at Rome) than to entertain the slightest doubt about 
the divine right of the pope.

To even think of the Pope as anything other than the 
Most Holy One was a sin of eternal damnation. My 
conscience and that of many good people are witnesses 
to this, which was horribly trapped by these heinous 
abominations. But thanks be to Christ, the most sweet 
Redeemer, who has raised us anew with Himself out of 
your death, and has shown us Iscarioth with his bowels 
spilled out, broken, stinking and cursing, despised and 
forsaken for His sake, and offered to all for laughter, 
mockery and hissing. Amen. O LORD, just and true are 
thy judgments; therefore, O LORD, preserve and keep 
us from this generation for ever. For it is full of the wicked 
everywhere, where such loose people rule among men,

43 Preface to John Sutel's Interpretation of the Gospel of the Destruction 
of Jerusalem. *) 


1539. 


Martinus Luther. 


(1) The world is now so evil, and the longer the worse, 
that one may well with all diligence and perseverance 
present the examples of divine judgment and wrath to 
the people and impress upon them, if it would help, that 
they are horrified by it, and yet improve a little. Now the 
worldly rulers themselves (who have the sword and the 
wrath of God in their hands and are commanded by God 
to punish the wicked) complain that the world is 
becoming more and more wanton and that the rule has 
become difficult and laborious. For the devil has become 
so powerful that even many of the rulers themselves are 
driving with all their might, who should punish it justly, 
and not only give evil examples, but also beginners and 





Agitators are to all misfortune that one must see and 
grasp that it cannot stand like this for long, but must 
break one day. And so it was with Jerusalem. Before 
they were led into the Babylonian prison, the prophet 
Ezekiel gave such a simile: Jerusalem would be a grop 
in which the fat and salt were so deeply unburned that it 
could not be made clean again by scrubbing or 
sweeping, but it would have to be burned in the fire and 
completely melted and made new. Jeremiah also 
speaks in the same way, that God says he must do as a 
potter did when his vessel was not right, and when he 
struck the clay and crushed it, so will he destroy 
Jerusalem; as was done.

The people of Jerusalem have to take comfort in the fact 
that the spoiled pot will be watered anew, and another 
pot will be made out of 1) unmade pots. For Jerusalem 
was rebuilt after the misery of Babylon, and a new pot 
and potter were made of the old clay and brass. But if it 
happens according to Isaiah's parable, that the evil pot 
is shattered so that not a shard of it remains in which one 
could fetch water or fire, that is terrible; as we see that it 
happened in the last destruction of Jerusalem. There the 
grop was melted into foam, and the pot was smashed 
into cinders, which they could not believe before great 
certainty, nor did they want to believe until faith came 
into their hands. | do not like to prophesy, nor do | want 
to prophesy; for what | prophesy, especially evil, 
generally comes more than | like, so that | often wish, 
even with St. Michea, that | had to be a liar and false 
prophet. Because | speak God's word, it must happen; 
but | worry, and must worry that our German country will 
one day be like Jerusalem. Alas! God help that my worry 
is lacking and my prophecy is a lie. We have it in mind

the door, as the Turk has melted and shattered Greece, 
up to Germany, by God's wrath; but we do not respect 
it, as little as the Jews respected the wrath of the 
Romans, sinning on and on, that we may become 
sufficiently a corrupt grop and pot. 

Therefore, it is good that this example of the 
destroyed Jerusalem (as this sermon does) be held up 
to us, along with other more wrathful punishments of 
God, if it would help a little, and through repentance the 
final misfortune and destruction might be forgiven. God's 
word does have an effect on people, and yet the divine 
judgment sometimes strikes even the stiff-necked, willful 
people, so that they must be frightened by it; for it 
certainly applies to us Germans in particular, a game 
that the devil has in mind, because he finds the word of 
God in us, which he cannot stand. And if we do not honor 
it better, but continue with contempt and ingratitude, it 
will be said: you have not recognized the time of your 
visitation. Then it is done, and the devil has already won; 
for if we despise the word, it despises us again, and 
separates from us as we separate from it. God 
graciously protect us from this, at least in our time. 
Amen.

thought that it should be necessary at this time to 
regurgitate the ABC of Christian doctrine to the people 
in such a childish manner, because so many (praise 
God!) books are available, that, if they had not been able 
to learn from 


from our books, but should have heard and learned from 
the quarreling and shouting, what the things were, about

Perhaps we should hope that, because they know 
nothing at all about the matter, they will not know or 
respect much the folly of the papists, and therefore the 
less they are poisoned by that part, the sooner they may 
be taught and instructed: so | have well seen that this 
childish way is let out by the pressure to help the poor 
common people with it in Christ. 

But how can one pray for you bishops more and more (I 
would almost have said curse), that you have let the 
churches lie desolate and corrupt, so that the people can 
teach even the Lord's Prayer, faith, God's 
commandment, and sacrament, yes, nothing? and for 
that so much and so great shameful scripture,

You have been able to suffer and promote lies and 
blasphemy well and knowingly, therefore you yourselves 
have been blinded, the longer the greater fools and 
damned people you have become. But God will gather 
his people and bind you chaff, stubble and thorns to the 
infernal fire, as you, hardened, want to have it 
yourselves. So go and fight, as you began, against God 
and your own conscience. For you shall prosper as you 
have deserved, and God grant you (because you will it 
so) that you may continue, and not think otherwise, for 
you can dampen the truth with lies, come to honor before 
God with blasphemies and desecrations, until at last you 
are also considered like bathmaids before the world with 
lies and blasphemies, amen. 


45, preface about the seudbries of the misery of the priests. *) 


1540. 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


D. Martin Luther. 
| did not want this booklet to perish under moth and 
mildew, since | consider it worthy of being read even 
today by us who are preachers of the church. Above all, 
| like the extremely free confession of misery. Although 
the author does not speak Latin well, he nevertheless, 
like a kind of Cato, presents the matter himself without 
ornamentation and accurately. And | am very much 
surprised that at that time someone had the audacity to 
publicly call the bishops devils and tyrants of the priests. 
He was certainly one of those whom the Lord forgave 
the sins of idolatry and preserved them wonderfully in 
this ruin of the Antichrist. For he makes Christ the 
example of the pastors or (as he calls them) curators, 
and the office and cross of the pastors. 


who among Christians does not recognize that this was 
a kind of spark or (as Christ says) a smoldering wick of 
true godliness and knowledge of God in such a troubled, 
humble and patient soul? Such people belonged to the 
church under the papacy. Although they were not 
without infirmities, sins and errors, they looked up to 
Christ, sighed and cried out to Him, as if they were 
people who were already drowning, while the other 
clerics (as they are called) served the devil, yes, were 
devils of the churches. Thus, the church has been 
preserved by the pastors and schoolmasters, who have 
been forced to teach the Word and administer the 
sacraments, even though they did not live without 
infirmities and did other things, since they were 
oppressed by the Antichrist and his rulers.

46, preface from D, Caspar Giittel's sermon, preached in the churchyard 
at Eisleben. *) 


1541. 


The Venerable Johann Bugenhagen, Doctor and 
Pastor at Wittenberg. 

1. grace and peace in Christ. | kindly ask, my dear lord 
and friend, because | do not have the time to read the 
booklet of my dear lord and friend, Doctor Caspar 
Glttels, pastor and superintendent of Eisleben, with 
leisure (because | suddenly fell three times prevented by 
other business), you should take it before you, and 
where the good man praises me, erase my name. | know 
well how sincerely good he means it; but you know how 
hostile my name is to the devil and his papists, especially 
where | am praised, so that reading, or even the fruit of 
reading, is destroyed, because even with many who 
want to be ours, my name stinks; but you will do it well 
without my concern. 
2 He writes, as | also notice from his letter, against the 
expectants, that is, those who wait for the concilium. 
They may be wise, sensible people who thus wait and 
stake their salvation on human statutes, but they fulfill 
the saying: A wise man does no small foolishness; or 
they must be completely ignorant and inexperienced in 
Christian faith, as they cannot judge how far God's word 
and man's word are different. Although | would like to 
give them credit for this, because until now the world, 
through the pope, has had to believe that the conciliar 
statutes are just as valid as God's, and more than God's 
word, which now even the geese and ducks, mice and 
lice (praise God!) would not believe, where they could 
believe something. But he who hears nothing, learns 
nothing; he who cannot hear, or does not want to hear, 
cannot or does not want to learn or know anything. Such 
expectants we command God. 





3. But next to them is another group of expecters who 
hear and read it, also want to hear and read it, know 
everything that the gospel teaches, know what the truth 
is, also confess that it is the truth and is in the gospel, 
and yet pretend that they want to wait for the judgment 
of the Council and the church, and in the meantime 
persecute and suppress the recognized truth of the 
gospel; as one and the most distinguished Duke George 
of Saxony (that | give a sure example), of unfortunate 
memory, has been with his followers. Whom do we want 
or should we command such expectants? God does not 
want and does not like them, because he wants his 
gospel to be kept above all angels, silent about men or 
concilia, and confesses about it to no one of any harrens 
or expectants. | am well aware that we have to send them 
to the devil in the abyss of hell, and let them wait and 
remain expectants, as the Jews also wait and are 
expectants for their Messiah, whom they crucified before 
out of hatred and envy, against public and known truth. 
Yes, let them wait, it serves them right that they wait; 
what are they worth better than to wait in vain for the lie 
forever, who did not want to accept the truth revealed at 
present? 

(4) So we let these expectants also wait for a council, 
which now the pope will not give, or even cannot, as he 
lets himself be heard publicly, and they nevertheless 
crucify and persecute the present truth, in order to obtain 
the beautiful title: Christian church, Christian princes, 
Christian people, who wait for the council, and curse 
God's word. Let them use such titles, but beware that you 
do not praise them in this way, lest you become a party 
to their sins and be exposed with them to hellish fire. For 
there is the terrible, horrible example before our eyes,

how God exterminated the Christian prince, yes, the 
wretched, damned man, Duke George, made him null 
and void, cast him into the abyss of hells. 

5 Such expectants should have such a concilium, 
because that is how they want it. As St. Paul says in 2 
Cor. 6:1, 2: "| beseech you, brethren, that ye receive not 
the grace of God in vain: for he saith, | have heard thee 
in due time. And Christ Matth. 10, 14. 15.: "Whichever 
city or house will not receive your word, come out, and 
shake off the dust of your shoes also upon it. | tell you, 
it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in that 
day" 2c. These were not expectants, as they did not 
know it to be the truth, 





but considered it to be error and heresy. Where will now 
remain the expellers who know and confess that it is the 
truth, and yet for the cover and adornment of their 
obdurate will and malicious, bloodthirsty outrage 
pretend that they want to wait for the concilii or church 
judgment. Oh, let them wait and remain expectants, as 
they deserve and are worthy, and to more condemnation 
and greater accumulation of wrath let them call 
themselves Christian princes among themselves, that is, 
blaspheme God in heaven confidently, and force that he 
must hasten with the last day. Amen, amen. My dear 
Lord Jesus Christ, come, and come quickly, amen.

47, preface to M. Joh, Spangenberg's Postille), 


1542. 


1 Saint Paul writes from time to time that Christ, our 
Lord, is a mystery, and the holy church (to the Ephesians 
[Cap. 5, 32]) with Christ, her bridegroom, may also be 
called a mystery. In former times, when | had to be called 
a doctor of the holy scriptures, | considered this to be a 
bad speech, which | understood very well. But now | 
(praise God!) have again become a poor student of the 
Holy Scriptures, and the longer the less | am able, the 
more | begin to regard such words as strange, and from 
experience | find this gloss that it must be called a secret; 
for as brightly and clearly as the apostles preach about 
it (even with miraculous signs), | do not understand it. 





It remained hidden and secret to the highest and wisest 
people on earth, as he says Matth. 11, 25: "You have 
hidden these things from the wise and prudent, but have 
revealed them to the children" 2c. Is it not miraculous 
enough? is it not secret enough: which is so publicly 
preached, and shines brighter than the sun, and is 
confirmed with so many great miraculous signs (which 
one cannot deny, God must do them), yet the most high, 
the cleverest, the holiest, the best here are supposed to 
be blind, deaf and nonsensical, that they cannot see, 
hear or feel it? Council here elders well, what is that? 
There is nothing more obvious, and yet nothing more 
secret; nothing more comprehensible than this. 


In the beginning, Joh. Spangenberg was rector at Gandersheim and Stollberg. When he came to the realization of the evangelical 
truth, he was called to Nordhausen as the head preacher at the church of St. Blasii. From there, on Luther's recommendation, he came to 
Eisleben as preacher of St. Andrew's Church and as superintendent of the county of Mansfeld. While he was in Nordhausen, he published in 
the years 1542 to 1544 a postilla on the Sunday and feast day gospels and epistles, written in a catechetical manner in questions and answers. 
It has five parts in folio. The first part, to which Luther wrote this preface, covers the Gospels from the first Advent to Easter, and appeared in 
1542; likewise the second part, which contains the Gospels to the end of the church year. The third part, in which the Gospels and Epistles 
of the most important feast days, apostles’ days and saints' days are explained, was published in 1543. This was followed in 1544 by the 
interpretations of the Sunday epistles. This postilla has not only been reprinted several times, but also translated into Latin and Low German.

There is nothing more incomprehensible than Christ in 
the manger and on the cross, nothing more 
incomprehensible than Christ at the right hand of God and 
Lord over all. So his word, which preaches about him, is 
also done. 

Our experience must also bear witness to this. How 
abundantly, brightly and clearly we have the same salvific 
word from Christ! But to whom is such manifest, bright, 
clear light known and pleasant? Is it not mystery and 
secret enough, not only for the papists, but also for ours, 
who boast of being almost evangelical? who do not think 
otherwise, when they have once read or heard it, that they 
are so full and enough that they could well teach all the 
apostles, not to mention their 1) poor pastors and 
preachers. Such think that it is neither a mystery nor a 
profound art, but a spoonful of wisdom, which they may 
drink up in one gulp. 

Now, what do we preachers want to do, who are to 
govern churches under such archangels and super- 
angels? This is what we want to do, we want to let them 
know everything better and a hundred times better than 
we ourselves do. And Christ shall be neither mystery nor 
secret with them, but a living nutshell, since they have 
hollowed out the kernel long before they are born and 
thrown away the shells; but we meanwhile want to suck 
on this secret like a child on its mother's breast, until we 
also get something of it once, and not let ourselves be 
weaned from it so early and so temporally, as these high 
people wean themselves and are ashamed to suck their 
mother's teats. For they can walk themselves before they 
have grown legs and feet. 

4. summa, we must let the world and the devils run 
their course, and with preaching, reproving, admonishing 
always stop, for the sake of those who shall know such a 
secret; to the others it is preached, as the rain falls into 
the water, or, as our Lord says Matth. 13, 19, is sown on 
the way; the secret alone wants to bear fruit on the fourth 
part of the field. Therefore, | am glad to see that this and 
similar books come to the people, not only to reveal such 
secrets, but also to make them more difficult to 
understand. 


1) The Erlanger, which follows a Nuremberg reprint, offers: "schweiget 
ihr arme Pfarrherr" 2c. 





2) more false books. For they are not all pure who now 
write, and everyone wants to sell them in the store, not to 
reveal Christ or his secret, but not to have his own secret 
and beautiful thoughts, which he holds about Christ's 
secret, for free, so that he hopes to convert even the 
devils, if he has never converted a mosquito, or can 
convert, if it would not be the worst thing to convert. 

(5) Nevertheless, some lazy pastors and preachers 
are also not good, who rely on such and other more good 
books, so that they can take a sermon from them, do not 
pray, do not study, do not read, do not strive for anything 
in the Scriptures, just as if one did not have to read the 
Biblia for that reason. They need such books as the forms 
and calendars to earn their yearly nourishment, and are 
nothing but parakeets or jackdaws that learn to repeat 
incomprehensibly, although our opinion and that of such 
theologians is to point them to the Scriptures and to 
admonish them to think, even to defend our Christian 
faith after our death against the devil, the world and the 
flesh. For we will not stand eternally at the head as we 
stand now. 

(6) And as our forefathers bequeathed to us this 
mystery, though it was horribly destroyed by the pope, so 
we also bequeath it to them; and though they will not have 
as much to do to expose such abominations as we have 
done, yet they will have just as much to do (if not more) 
to resist and ward off the devil, lest he again cast such 
abominations into the church. Therefore it is said, watch, 


study, attende lectioni. Truly you cannot read too much 
in the Scriptures, and what you read you cannot read too 
well, and what you read well you cannot understand too 
well, and what you understand well you cannot teach too 
well, and what you teach well you cannot live so 3) well.

is our flesh that is against us.

rage and rage. Therefore, dear lords and brethren, 
pastors and preachers, pray, read, study, be diligent; for 
verily, it is no time for sloth, snoring, and sleeping, in this 
evil and shameful time. Use your gift, which is entrusted 
to you, and manifest the 


Mystery of Christ. If anyone does not want to know, let 
him be ignorant, as St. Paul says 1 Cor. 14, 38. Because 
baptism and sacrament are there, we do not have to 
keep silent about the word of the mystery. It will be found 
when we have done our part, amen. 


48, preface to the young dukes of Saxony, Johann Friedrich the Second 
and Johann Wilhelm's, speeches, held at Wittenberg, *) 


1543. 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


In these days we have seen and heard a peculiar and 
quite unusual example among the Germans, that two 
brothers, one of whom is in his thirteenth year, the other 
in his fourteenth, and are almost still (as they say) 
children, have delivered these two Latin speeches in 
immediate succession before this entire university. And 
these brothers are not of low or mediocre, but of the 
highest nobility, namely of the highest and most famous 
origin, as the sons of our most noble prince and lord, 
Lord Johann Friedrich, Duke of Saxony, Elector 2c., the 
most gracious protector of all studies, arts and virtues. 
He himself was present with several other princes and 
listened with great joy (as one might well believe and 
was Clearly evident), namely as a father, since his sons 
had made such good progress in their studies at such a 
tender age and in such a short time. 

| was truly astonished, among others, not only at the 
greatness of the boys' courage, but also at the fact that 
in such a large gathering they were so fearless and 
focused on their own interests. 





The people of the city not only gave their speeches most 
skillfully in Latin, but also spoke so purely, so 
emphatically, and so clearly, and almost from memory, 
as if they were speaking extemporaneously. 

At the same time, | was reminded of the time, only a 
short time ago, in which one could not have found one in 
the whole crowd of the (so-called) clergy, not even 
among the Roman popes, cardinals, bishops, even the 
doctors, and all those who wanted to be considered the 
most learned among them, who could have done 
something like that. Certainly the sciences, however 
despised they may be by other great and distinguished 
ones, have attained great adornment and great honor 
through these high-born, illustrious princes, but they, in 
turn, have also adorned these so great princes with no 
less honor. 

Here one can see what good instruction is and how 
much it is capable of, especially if (as here) there is an 
educable nature and a good head. In this matter, the 
counsel and will of the good father and most noble prince 
is extraordinary. 





*) The complete title of the writing, to which Luther wrote this preface, is: Illustrium princijjum juniorum Saxoniae Jo. Friderici Il.

He is to be highly praised, who did not love his sons in 
the common way of princes and nobility, that is, did not 
suffer them to be neglected in idleness and ignorance, 
but took care with all diligence and care that they were 
properly taught and instructed, so that they would not 
only be famous by their high descent, but also admired 
by all peoples by their science and trained spiritual gifts. 
But the speeches themselves have taken away from me 
all material for praise before; from these the reader 
himself will recognize more than my dry and meager or 
rather rough and bad speech can say. 

What remains is for us to wish the dear boys and 
noble princes all the best, and to ask God the Father, 
who is the giver of these and all good gifts, that he may 
wish, through the blessing of his abundant grace, to give 
these happily begun studies and teachings an even 
happier progress and the most blessed fruit. This is all 
the more to be requested because we Christians cannot 
doubt at this ungrateful and exceedingly bad time that 
the devil, the most ferocious enemy of all good and of 
God Himself, who is like a roaring lion and extremely 
bitter because of the confession of the Gospel by these 
princes, will try with all his efforts and treachery to hinder 
and destroy these gifts of God, if he cannot destroy them 
completely. 

And we see in the sacred histories, yea, even in the 
histories of the Gentiles, with what, how constituted and 
how great intrigues and stratagems he has always 
sought to rule in the courts of kings and princes (for he 
perceives that from these proceed the greatest and most 
salutary fruits in the church and in the world regiment), 
and has endeavored to reverse all. 


401 


so that if a prince is not surrounded and protected by this 
prayer, Ps. 20:2, 3.: "The name of the God of Jacob 
protect thee, he send thee help from the holy place, and 
strengthen thee out of Zion," he will surely be among so 
many dragons, serpents, wolves, foxes, and what other 
worse monsters there are, servants of the raging devil, 
that is, among deceitful robbers, faithless friends, 
treacherous servants, predatory great ones, as a single 
person and alone cannot bear and endure his burden, 
and yet is forced to live and rule among them. For he 
desires only and most eagerly the princes and everything 
that is best and highest in the world; his gullet desires 
sweet morsels, his food is chosen, and (as Habakkuk 
[Cap. 1, 10.] says) he laughs at the princes. 

Therefore, let the church and everyone who wants to 
belong to Christ command these dear princes and their 
studies and their leaders, and stand by them with faithful 
and earnest prayer to God against the devil, their most 
important enemy. In this way we will not only offer God 
an extremely pleasant sacrifice, but also do ourselves a 
necessary and salutary favor. For who can achieve it with 
thoughts, let alone words, something how blissful it is to 
live under a good and wholesome prince who seeks, 
increases and preserves the glory of God and the welfare 
of the commonwealth? These are gifts and (as the 
Scriptures speak) exceedingly rich blessings from GOD. 

Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who has 
begun his good work in these princely brethren, grant 
that they may keep these two sayings for great service 
and fruit, not only to other princes but also to themselves, 
and that they may repeat them to themselves forever and 
keep them for the glory of God and the salvation of men. 
Amen.

49, preface on the life descriptions of the fathers, edited by v. Georg 
Major, *) 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


D. Martin Luther greets the godly reader. 


Among other works of the devil's rage, not the least 
is that he has largely destroyed the histories or, as they 
are called, the legends of the saints, and that those of 
which he has suffered to persist (undoubtedly against 
his will) have been so falsified with foolish fables and 
ungodly lies that some fables of the pagans are much 
more similar to the truth, and more useful. So great is 
the hatred of the serpent against the seed of the woman 
and the church of Christ that he persecutes the memory 
of the saints even after their death, so that not even their 
excellent sayings and deeds could serve as a salutary 
example or comfort to the living. Hence the evil that we 
do not even have the histories of the apostles, which 
should be most such, reliable and pure, except as much 
as has been left to us by Lucas, Eusebius and some 
others. Other things are desired and desired in vain. 

For even in the city of Rome itself one does not know 
where the heads and bodies of the apostles Peter and 
Paul are, nor of their complete histories, although the 
popes annually display to the foolish people two wooden 
and artificially made heads of Peter and Paul, of which 
they make the common people believe, and want to be 
believed, that they are the natural skulls of Peter and 
Paul. 





Paul. And on the altar where they are buried, they 
consecrate the pallia of the bishops, boasting that they 
are sent down from heaven to the heads of the apostles, 
as the Decretals speak, and with incredible falsehood 
and the most senseless desire to lie, they deceive the 
whole world, for the glory and honor of the devil, the 
father of lies, whose servants they are. They do the 
same with the deceitful table of Veronica. Even though 
they know that it is nothing, and a vain pretense, they 
still display it with great ostentation as the image of the 
Savior printed on his face-cloth (as they call it), but it is 
so covered with cloths that no one can see anything, not 
even those who display it. For who could see that which 
is nothing? But what need of many words? The very city 
that used to be the holiest and most excellent place of 
the whole Church in the whole world at the time of the 
martyrs, then became, as it still is, through the most 
impudent lies and the most foolish fables, because the 
godless and wicked popes turned a blind eye to it, the 
place that is most full in all corners of all shame and vice, 
and completely a puddle of dung. Namely, the devil's so 
terrifying wish is fulfilled, on which his desire has always 
stood, that he should make of the best church a 
diabolical, quite horrible 





*The book, which Major, prompted by Luther, published, has the title: Vitae patrum in usum ministrorum verbi, quoad ejus fieri 
potuit, repurgatae. Per Georgium Majorem. Cum Praefatione D. Doctoris Martini Lutheri. Vitembergae. 1544. ockiiv. At the 
end: Imprint Wittembergae per Petrum Seitz. Luther wrote a preface to it. The same is found in Latin in the Erlangen edition, opp. var. 
arZ-, toni. VII, x. 568. The book itself has been printed very often, although it is not known who the author of it is. Some mention Jerome, 
others Evagrius of Antioch, still others Evagrius of Pontus; even the time of writing is not known. A Dutch Jesuit, Heribert Rosweidus, 
published it in 1617 in folio at Leiden and reports that he had seen twenty different Latin editions published in the period from the invention 
of the printing press to 1596, and eleven editions in other languages, namely in Italian, English, French and Dutch. The Wittenberg edition 
has also been reprinted several times, in 1559, 1562 and 1578. M. Sebastian Schwan, preacher at Ratzeburg, translated the Blich together 
with Luther's preface into German and had it printed in quarto in 1604. Because Walch did not know about this translation, he had Luther's 
preface translated again by Joh. Frick. We have again prepared a new translation.

Robber's den made and a pile of manure, which is not 
at all clean. 

Did he then dare to defile Rome in such an 
abominable way (God in His wrath allowed this, since 
our ingratitude compelled Him to do so), which Christ 
has cleansed by the exceedingly great work of His Spirit, 
as it is written, Ps. 110, 6: "He will crush the head over 
great lands", Dear, what should He leave us in other 
parts of the world (as much as His rage was able to do) 
that is pure and clean? Therefore, the world is full of 
godlessness, idolatry, worship, fables and legends of 
the saints, godless masses, and who can enumerate all 
the aversions? See even the Scriptures and the 
Sacraments of God, with how many kinds and subtypes 
of heresies and errors he has tried to corrupt them! and 
even today he rages in this matter no less than he 
always did before. With this malice he has also 
particularly attacked this very famous book, which the 
whole church calls "the life descriptions of the fathers" 


(vitas patrum). 

But here | will first quote the saying of St. Jerome 
himself, which is in his letter to Ctesiphon against the 
Pelagians. Evagrius of Pontus, he says, the hyperborite 
who writes "to the virgins," writes "to the monks," has 
also published a book and has uttered sayings trepi 


dmac&kélac [about 
the insensitivity), which [onackeia we 


impassibilitas or imperturbatio, since the mind is 
never moved by any affliction of disturbance, and (to put 
it simply) is either a stone or God. These books are read 
by people in the Orient in Greek, and, since his disciple 
Rufinus translated them, by most in the Occident in 
Latin. The latter also wrote a book as if it were about 
monks, and lists many in it who were never followers of 
Origen, and of whom he writes that they were. And there 
is no doubt that they [the followers of Origen] have been 
condemned by the bishops, namely Ammonius and 
Eusebius and Euthymius and Evagrius himself, also 
Origen and Isidore and many others, all of whom it would 
be irksome to enumerate. And according to the well- 
known words of Lucretius: 


Ac veluti pueris absynthia tetra medentes Cum 
dare conantur, prius oras pocula circum 


Contingunt dulci mellis flavoque liquore (And just 
as the physicians, when they seek to give the 
abominable wormwood to the children, first coat the rim 
around the cup with the sweet and yellow liquid of 
honey), so he put some John at the beginning of this very 
book, of whom it is not doubtful that he was orthodox and 
holy, so that through him he would have the opportunity 
to bring the other heretical people (whom he had 
mentioned) into the church 2c. The rest, dear reader, 
you read for yourself. There are certainly hard things 
about Rufinus and Eusebius of Caesarea, if the narrative 
is true. 

With these words St. Jerome seems to call this book 
and to point to it with his finger. If this book was already 
so corrupted and confused at that time, what and how 
much fables and lies do you think were added after those 
times? Such as that of Marinus, of Euphrosine, of 
Simeon 1) on the column, and many similar things, 
which are partly poetical, by which boastful people 
wanted to make it seem as if the Stoic insensitivity 


(apathias) had been surpassed in the church, which, 
however, no Stoic has ever seen or experienced, and 
partly the most impudent fables, with which the church 
has been mocked in its right miracles. 

But this must be noted in the words of St. Jerome, that 
2) among this kind of monks he condemns only those 
who were Pelagians and followers of Origen. And since 
one cannot deny that many have had the same name, 
some of whom were heretics, others orthodox, this 
confusion arises, that one does not know who and how 
he was. For if one wanted to condemn the whole 
monastic state (as it was at that time), one would first of 
all condemn St. Jerome himself, who not only praised 
this state too highly, as you see in Anthony, Paul, 
Hilarion, Malchus, but-

The fact that he himself left the city [Rome] and became 
a monk is a dangerous example for many. 

It was at that time the use, if such a great raging of 
Satan can otherwise be called a use, that one began to 
put into practice with greater impetuosity what Paul had 
foretold, 1 Tim. 4, 3: "And forbid to become celibate, and 
to avoid food" 2c., as if no one could be a Christian if he 
were not celibate and had enough of the Stoic doctrines, 
so that even the books of Jerome himself require a 
reader of sharp judgment, since he is quite unjust 
against marriage, and, if he had been at liberty, would 
have considered the second marriage equal to 
whoredom. But the service of faithful bishops, who 
condemned the errors of Pelagius and Origen, brought 
him back from this and corrected him afterwards, 
although he had not hesitated before to write that Origen 


was the right teacher (Magistrum) of the churches after 
the time of the apostles. 

Since it is now the case that this book "the 
biographies 1) of the fathers" requires a very strict 


examination and sifting (CeNSura), after everything has 
been mixed up in an unspeakable way by evil raging, so 
that one cannot know what belongs to Rufinus, what to 
Jerome or others, then what of Jerome's things is 
certain, in which spirit he wrote this or that: so | have 
incited v. Georg Major and have hardly been able to 
persuade him by pleading that he take on this burden of 
sorting out and cleaning all these things, which is no 
doubt very burdensome. Georg Major, and by pleading 
could hardly induce him to take upon himself this burden 
of sorting out and cleaning all these things, which is 
undoubtedly very burdensome. For in this book, as in 
Jerome, there are many excellent speeches and deeds 
that must be picked up like lumps from the table of the 
Gospel and not thrown away with the filth that other 
impertinent 


1) Instead of Vitas, Wohl Vitae will be read. 





The first two of these are the birds that have interfered 
with the people, just as those hideous birds defiled the 
meal of Aeneas in Virgil's work. 

However, it is not difficult to recognize and distinguish 
which of the two one has to agree with. For the 
Pelagians and the followers of Origen insist on the Stoic 
insensitivity and on | don't know what kind of perfections 
of life. In this they also gave Augustine a hard time. 
Incidentally, they are very reserved and quiet about 
grace, faith, forgiveness of sins and the true miraculous 
deeds of God, through which, as Isaiah says, even a 
child overcomes death, sin and hell, not to say they are 
completely silent about it, but they puff up their stoic 
insensitivity with full cheeks. On the other hand, the 
orthodox, who walk on the right middle road, do not let 
sins take the reins, nor do they presume perfections, but 
attach forgiveness of sins, grace, life and blessedness 
to penitent and believing sinners. As these works are 
only of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, they are 
hidden from those who are wise and prudent. For who is 
there among them who sees that a baptized little child is 
a lord and victor over sin, death and the devil? But they 
have already forgotten their baptism, and attack this 
enemy with their own powers to overcome him, that is, 
the devil, sin, death. They should realize that he is 
already overcome for them in their baptism, that is, in 
Christ, the seed of the woman. 

This shall be the rule that was and will be for all 
eternity. To God be praise and glory. Amen.

50, preface Who Spalatin's writing: Comforting examples and sayings read 
together from the life descriptions of the saints, *) 


March 8, 1544. 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


To the venerable brother in the Lord, M. Georg 
Spalatin, pastor of the congregation in Altenburg, 
and exceedingly faithful and loud superintendent 
of the congregations of his diocese in Meissen, 
grace and peace in Christ, our God and Savior. 


It pleases me, dear Spalatin, and | do not doubt that 
it pleases God and all who seek God, that you have 
collected the most important 1) sayings and deeds of the 
saints of God. For this is not only to shut the mouths of 
those who speak unjustly against us and disparage us, 
as if we were sowing new opinions and doctrines, but 
also to strengthen our consciences, which are instructed 
by acloud of so many testimonies and examples of the 
ancients, who kept, said, did, and suffered the same 
things as we do. For although each one's faith in the 
Word of God must be sufficient for him to stand in battle 
against the gates of hell, even for himself alone, yet a 
godly heart, since beside the willing spirit there is also 
the weak flesh, is not a little or slightly moved when it 
sees that so many centuries, so many examples, so 
many excellent men before him and around him have 
been like him, and always the same thing has happened 
through them, which we have learned from Scripture and 
recognize in ourselves through daily experience. It is 
true that there are many things about the holy

that are interspersed in their histories by ungodly 
servants of the devil; but when it has come to the death 
struggle and confession with them, we see how pure and 
constant they testify to their faith. What could Ambrose 
have said more godly and braver than this, since in his 
last battle against sin, death, the wrath of God and hell, 
he addressed this word to the priests in the greatest 
confidence: | have not lived in such a way that | should 
be ashamed to live among you; but neither am | afraid to 
die, because we have a good Lord. This word was also 
praised by St. Augustine in his death struggle, as 
Possidonius tells in his legend. And Augustine also 
consoled himself with this word of his own against 
conscience (which is the cruelest servant of death) and 
said: "I will be afraid, but not ashamed, because | will 
remember the wounds of Christ. | will remember the 
wounds of Christ. Who does not see that with such 
words the holy men testify to faith in Christ, which, 


though bare (nudam) and alone, is firm and victorious 
against death and sin? For although they hold that

their lives and deeds are blameless (as is proper and 
must be), they nevertheless rely before God solely on 
His mercy and goodness, keep silent about merits, and 
want to be found in the wounds of Christ like a dove in 
the holes in the rock (but the rock is Christ). We therefore 
do right and well if we first cleanse the sayings and 
deeds of the saints from the lies that do not belong to 
them, then rightly divide the word and carefully test it by 
the rule or likeness of faith, as the apostle teaches [1 
Thess. 5:21]: "Test everything, and keep what is good." 
What need would this reminder have been if all the 
sayings and deeds of the saints were to be taken for 
articles of faith without examination? Their profession 
was not the same as that of the apostles and prophets. 
They were saints, but men, and their willing spirit had to 
suffer not only from the weak, but also from the resisting 
flesh. Where they therefore speak and we 


If the saints of God are under the dominion of the Spirit, 
their words and works must be collected as gospel 
fragments, since these were wrought in them by the Lord 
Christ, and are in fact the Lord Christ's own works; but 
where they speak and act in opposition to the flesh, they 
are not to be condemned, but excused or borne, for our 
very consolation, because we see that the saints of God 
were like us weak men, and that each one had his 
weakness in his sinful flesh. For this reason, dear 
Spalatin, | wanted your book to be published. But 
henceforth you will refrain from such great (I would say 
false, if | were not aware of your sincerity) praises of me. 
| Know that | am nothing. Fare well in the Lord and pray 
for me that | may blessedly depart from the body of death 
and this sinful flesh, Amen. March 8, 1544.

state, *) 


1545. 


Martinus Luth, D. 


(1) | did not want to write anything against him, even in 
the life of Sebastian Franken, because | despised such 
a wicked man too highly, and always thought that his 
writing would be worthless among all sensible people, 
especially among Christians, and would perish by itself 
in a short time, like a curse of an angry, wicked man, 
because this is what King Solomon teaches in his 
Proverbs, Cap. 26, 2. "As a bird flew by, and a swallow 
passed by, so is an undeserved curse, and does 
nothing." Here Solomon teaches us to beware of the 
undeserved curse. 


Do not accept the good mouths that like to curse and 
blaspheme, but think and say: "It is a swallow that flies 
over me and tickles a little. For whoever would be so 
mad that he would not suffer such things from the 
swallow, but would prevent its flight, as if he were 
worried that it would nest and muck on his head, 1) or 
gouge out his eyes, or bite off his nose, would be taken 
for a fool, and would also have to be mad in truth, who 
would take vain, foolish care and work.

2 In Vitis Patrum it is also read that a brother complains 
to an old father, how "so many evil thoughts came into 
his head", which hurt him; for the devil is a master of 
writing evil thoughts into good hearts, against God and 
man, and has for this purpose a hard pen and very sharp 
ink, which burns like fire, from his infernal inkpot; the old 
man answered and said: "Do you hear it? You cannot 
prevent birds from flying over your head, but you can 
prevent them from nesting in your hair. So do the same 
here: if thoughts come to you, let them go; if they come, 
let them go, and do not stop them or quarrel with them. 

Now Bastian Frank is such a wicked blasphemous 
mouth, which can do nothing but blaspheme and defile, 
and likes to write and speak the worst of everyone, as if 
he were the devil's own and dearest mouth; that | think it 
has been his life to think and speak evil of other people, 
from which he has fed more than from eating and 
drinking. There is no one who teaches rightly or lives 
rightly, he is, or is called, as he pleases and who he 
pleases; and if he encounters something good, he lets it 
pass, or turns it back shamefully, always seeking and 
pondering evil, of which he may say that it seems good, 
as he is sorry in his heart where he finds something good 
that he cannot blame, and all his heart's desire is where 
he can find evil, which he may shake to a stink. Repent, 
then, of his delight in poor men's misfortunes, errors, and 
sins, as a foul-mouthed sow does with her trunk in the 
mire and stink. 

4 And yet he found that he knew how history books 
are read with particular pleasure before others, and are 
held dear, because everyone would naturally like to know 
what has happened in the past, still happens, and should 
happen. Therefore, he especially intended to write 
histories for him, so that he could spread his poison 
among the people all the more powerfully under the 
honey and sugar and do all the greater harm; for he well 
felt that he could be quite unfit and not useful for teaching 
the truth and resisting error or heresy, nor for some 
church service, 








Therefore he did not care about such things, but only 
wanted to do what he could, that is, blaspheme and defile, 
and feast and delight in it. 

5. For from his books you will not well learn what a 
Christian should believe, or what a pious man should do; 
he neither can nor will teach it; yes, that is much more, 
you will not know from his books what he himself believes, 
or what kind of man he is; he censures everything, but 
says nothing against it, or disputes what one should 
believe or hold; without as much as | can sense and judge 
by the smell of my nose, he is an enthusiast or Gaister, 
who likes nothing, for Gaist, Gaist, Gaist, who thinks 
nothing of Word, Sacrament, preaching, but by the Gaift 
one should live, that is such a life, The coiner also made 
his peasants neither want to see nor hear a letter, nor a 
book, nor a scripture, and called us and our scribes and 
literalists, and mocked us when they saw a book in our 
hands; And when we would speak unto them, they 
stopped up their ears, saying that they had the gist, and 
could not hear our word. That is a life in which every man 
is his own master, and does what he wants; and what 
seems good to him must then be all right and well done, 
and called the gout; everything else must stink, and be 
nothing but vain dross, dross, dross. 

6th For when he had articulated Luther well enough 
and peevishly enough, with all his doctrine, and comes to 
the words of the Sacrament: This is my body 2c., he says: 
These words Luther has caught, and continues with them, 
and shall break it all, as if the Gaist were nothing. You can 
hear that he is hostile to the letter of the holy Scriptures, 
and is not only a zealot or sacrament desecrator, but, as 
| said, he is a devotee and enthusiast, who does not want 
to be under God's word or the holy Scriptures, but to be 
judge and master over them out of devotion. What wonder 
is it that such a possessed person can neither teach nor 
do anything good? He must blaspheme, defile, lie and 
deceive God and men, as the spirit of evil drives him when 
he is drunk and full, and then most of all when he presents 
himself as most holy and pious. The Gaist can

Nothing else, of which we have been warned enough by 
the dear apostles. 

(7) Other, pious teachers (even some heretics do the 
same), they also rebuke and punish the vices confidently; 
but they do not do this because they have pleasure and 
joy in the vices, to shake, to laugh or to mock the poor 
miserable sinners in their heart, like the Pharisee in the 
Gospel [Luc. 18, 11.] and said: "I thank you, God, that | 
am not like other people, and like this tax collector"; and 
like the shameful. Ham did to his father Noah (Gen. 9, 
22.He laughed at this and told his brothers with all his 
heart, as if he were sorry that his father was lying there 
drunk and uncovered, or sober; but for this reason the 
pious punish all kinds of vices, that they would like to 
correct them, and they are sorry and grieved in their 
hearts that people are thus fallen into sin and disgrace by 
the devil and the flesh; they would rather that neither sin 
nor vice should happen; Besides, they teach much and 
all good things, and let themselves be heard and heard 
freely, who they are, what they believe, and what they do 
not believe, that we may know what we have in them, and 
where we may find them at home; summa, they are 
children of light, and walk in the light. 

(8) But the Hamists and Pharisees ask nothing about 
how to advise or help other people; they are satisfied with 
the fact that they can feast on other people's dirt and sins 
and make themselves useless, wanting to be seen and 
praised before the world. | am reminded of them, like the 
disgraceful flies, which sometimes in natural distress, in 
the secret chamber, want to crawl into our buttocks, and 
feast in the same rose and fine flower, and suck their 
honey, and then fly out; when they have well defiled the 
proboscis and feet there, they want to sit in our face on 
the nose, on the eyes, cheeks, mouth, in the most honest 
place, as if they came from a fragrant pleasure garden or 
an apothecary. 

9. such flies one is this Sebastian

Erlangeners: to him. 





Frank, and almost the most distinguished one, that he 
would like to bet with his father Ham, and with his 
brother, your Pharisee, who would like to keep the 
beautiful name Beelzebub before alleil auderu in this 
matter. Beelzebub is called a large fly, which we 
Germans call a bumblebee; which name the people of 
Israel gave to the devil in ancient times, as we read in 
the Gospel. For this is the devil's own way and office, 
that he sours, digs and shakes his proboscis in the sins 
of poor people, as if he would like to make the dirt so big 
and wide that heaven would be full of stink and God with 
all the angels would be out. Yes, just such a bumblebee 
is this Sebastian Frank, as you will see in this booklet of 
M. Johann Freders. For there he crawls up the butts of 
all women, and together with his shameful proboscis 
drives out everything that the devil has ever spoken evil 
of women, or done through them. There he tickles 
himself with, laughs and does him so heartily gentle that 
he may speak nothing good but all evil of them; has his 
pleasure in such nice, fine balsam and thesem; He also 
holds it up to our noses and mouths, as if we should 
thank and praise him for bringing such a stink and devil's 
filth to our noses, or as a great bumblebee has stuck 
such great filth in our faces through his books that we 
should be happy. 

(10) | only want to indicate one thing, so that | may 
show that | have read his books and am not hostile to 
him without cause. Dear, tell me, how is it fitting for a 
writer of history to say, "Put out the light, and the women 
will all be the same? And if he had heard such words 
from a frivolous man, should he therefore write it in the 
book and confirm it with such joy and pleasure? Should 
he not at least, if he had forgotten the holy women and 
virgins, think of his own mother, or of his own wife, and 
be ashamed in his heart if there were a speck of reason 
or honor, or an honest drop of blood in his body? Or why 
are not all men the same when the light is put out? 

Yes, perhaps he didn't mean it that badly. Mine this 
way, mine that way, he certainly has

This is what he meant when he said that he wanted to 
defile women, as he does to everyone else. For in honor 
of women, one must not say such words as this, and 
many more that you will find in this booklet, yet well 
punished and condemned, which no pious man of 
integrity can read with patience. And whoever likes to 
read them is as pious and honest as this Beelzebub 
Frank, or the shitty poet Lemchen, who has also been 
such an arshummel. 

12 But, as | said, | have never intended to write against 
this Beelzebub Franken, nor do | want to do so yet, and 
| do not consider him worthy of honor, as he is not worthy 
either. Whoever has reason will 





| know how to hold myself against such Franks, 
Lemchen, Hammers and Pharisees. | know that whoever 
can read Franconia's or Lemchen's book with pleasure 
and love cannot have a merciful God, nor can he have 
his own conscience satisfied, whether he has one and 
all devils as merciful lords. However, in honor of this 
booklet, | have written this preface, because | myself 
would have liked to write many annoying things against 
the Franconian, so that | may help to warn everyone 
against the devil and his bumblebees, who are both 
enemies of God and man, and do harm to honor, body 
and soul, and wherever they can. Christ our Lord, save 
him and destroy him, amen. 


52, preface about the prayer booklet with the calendar and 
Passional. *) 


1545. 


D. Martinus Luther. 

1. | have considered it good to add the old Passion 
Booklet to the Prayer Booklet, mostly for the sake of 
children and the simple, who are better moved to retain 
the divine stories through images and similes than 
through mere words or teachings, as St. Marcus testifies 
that Christ also preached vain parables to them for the 
sake of the simple. 

2. but | have added some more stories from the 
Biblia, and put sayings from the text with them, so that 
both will be remembered the more securely and firmly; 
and all this for good reference and example, if anyone 
would follow it, and, if he were skilled in it, improve it. 

3 For | do not consider it evil if such stories are told even 
in parlors and bedrooms. 


The people painted the walls with the sayings, so that 
God's work and word would always be before their eyes 
in all places, and so that they would exercise fear and 
faith in God. 

4 And what harm would it do if someone had all the 
main stories of the entire Bible painted one after the 
other in a booklet, so that such a booklet would be and 
be called a layman's Bible. Truly, one cannot hold the 
word and work of God against the common man too 
much or too often. 

(5) Though we sing and say, sound and preach, write 
and read, paint and draw, yet Satan is always too strong 
and valiant to hinder and suppress the same with his 
angels and members, that such our endeavor and 
diligence is not only good, but also well needed and 
most necessary. 


*The book to which Luther wrote this preface is entitled: "Betbtchlin, mit dem Calender vnd Passional, auffs new corrigirt vnd gemehret. 
D. Mar. Luther. LI.1).X1,V." 285 leaves in 12. At the end: "Gedruckt in der Churfiirstlichen Stad, Wittemberg durch Hans Lufft, XXX0 H).XH" 
The preface is in the Hallische Theile, p. 465; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XXII, appendix, p. 139 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 63, p. 391. 
Walch was under the misapprehension that the Passional here is the same writing as that which has been included in this volume Col. 198, 
and therefore placed the misleading title above it: "Vorrede Uber das Passionalbiichlein," which the Erlangen edition 1. e. has retained. Walch 
later noticed his error and improved it in the 23rd volume under the additions, p. 16. A single edition of the "old Passionals", however, did not 


occur to him.

6 But whether the iconoclasts will condemn and despise 
this is not my concern; they have no need of our 
teaching, so we do not want their teaching, and so we 
are soon separated. Abuse and false confidence in 
images | have always condemned and punished, as in 


all other matters. But what is not 


Abuse is, | have always let it remain and be called, so 
that one brings it to useful and blessed custom. So we

Two prefaces to the booklet: What was sought at the Imperial Diet of Nuremberg in 1522 
to 1523 by Papal Holiness from the Imperial Majesty Governor and Estates for Lutheran 
matters, and what was answered. *) 


1538. 


a. Preface to the message of Pope Hadrian VI sent to the Diet of Nuremberg in 1522. 


Moses commands his people with great diligence 
that they should never forget the misery in Egypt from 
which God had delivered them, so that he also puts it 
first in the first commandment, saying: "| am the Lord, 
your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of misery. 
As our Lord Christ also in his testament sets it forth, that 
we should remember him, that he saved us from death 


by his body and blood 2c. So we must also do now with 
the papacy, and always remember in what cruel tyranny 
we have been under it, and never forget from what 
sorrow and misery of our conscience the Lord has 
redeemed us again through his holy word. 

That is why we should read these and similar books 
and preserve them diligently, so that un- 


and sins. 





*The book, to which these two prefaces are attached, contains quite a number of documents concerning the demands of the pope on 
the German imperial estates and their response to them. Most of these are found in the ninth volume of the Wittenberg German edition and 
in Walch, vol. XV, col. 2504 ff, and have been printed very frequently in German and Latin. In 1538, Luther himself arranged for a new edition, 
both in German and in Latin, to which he added two prefaces, one of which precedes the book, the other within it at the response of the 
imperial estates and the complaints against the papal see. The title of the German edition is: "Was aufs dem Reichstag zu Nuremberg, von 
wegen Bepstlicher Heiligkeit, an Keiserlicher Maiestat Stathalter vnd Stende, Lutherischer suchen halben belangt, vnd darauff geantwort 
worden ist, Auch etliche ding, wie die folgende verkiirzze Vorrede vnd Register anzeigt. With a preface by D. Mart. Luth. Wittemberg. 1538." 
18 quarto sheets. At the end: "Printed at Wittemberg, by Hans Frischmut." On the back of the title page is an index. The following five pages 
contain Luther's preface, namely the one that we bring here as the first. It is found in the Wittenberg edition (1569), vol. IX, p. I56b, where it 
is followed by a number of writings that indicate the pope's demands, e.g. the breve of Pope Hadrian VI to the imperial estates at Nuremberg, 
the pope's instruction for his legate, what he "werben" sals Botschaft ausrichten" foll 2c. This is followed in 1. 6. p. 164p by the note: "You will 
find the answer of the imperial mayor, the governor, and the common imperial estates, to the advertising of the papal legate, item of the 
secular imperial estates' complaint, etc." Christian readers can find this in the same book fol. 18. and 27. with a preface by D. Mart. Luther." 
On the basis of this remark, we believed we were justified in making the above statement (which also receives further confirmation below) 
that the second preface is within the book. Moreover, the German preface alone is found in the Wittenberg (1559), vol. XII, p. 366; in the Jena 
(1568), vol. VI, p. 535; in the Altenburg, vol. VI, p. 1234; in the Leipzig, twice, namely vol. XVIII, p. 323 and vol. XXI, p. 239; in Walch (in the 
Nachlese) vol. XXI, Col. 181* Und in the Erlanger, vol. 63, p. 393. Because both prefaces undoubtedly belong together and to the same writing, 
we have brought the first preface from the 21st volume here. About the second preface, which we had to translate from Latin, we give 
information in the following number (53b).

Our descendants will also see what evil and tyranny the 
pope has done and practiced in Christendom, and help 
us praise and glorify God to learn to beware of popery 
and other errors 1). For the papists now began to adorn 
themselves, as one sings of the old man, that he put on 
his long cloak, and turned out the best end, as he went 
to the bogeyman. They steal from our books, which they 
never knew nor taught before, whether they could cover 
their previous disgrace with it, and smear the people's 
mouths as if they had never been without water. But it 
will not and shall not help. There are too many books and 
other landmarks, even their own decrees and bulls; they 
cannot be decorated nor covered. So they do not stop 
with impudent, stinking lies, pretending to reform the 
Roman court and the whole church, even to hold a 
concilium; thus, they are making fun of the whole of 
Christendom as if they were vain jugglers or puppets, 
who could hardly notice anything, how false false they 
pretend to be. 

But they meet the right time and arrive in good shape, 
because God has attacked them and exposed their 
shame, so that they now have to mend and patch 
themselves first, when the leather has become too short 
for them, so that the Roman whore is publicly seen 
behind and in front. If she wants to adorn herself in front, 
she unveils herself behind; if she wants to cover herself 
behind, she stands naked in front. They are a lot of 
scribblers, and would like to make something stinky, but 
have nothing in the belly. Their hour has come, as it says 
in Apocalypse. Therefore let them only work and write 
confidently; they are not worthy of better work than that 
they work in vain, and make their own things worse and 
worse. They are like Virgilii, where one milks a goat and 
the other holds a sieve under it. As the goat gives milk, 
so the butter is found in the sieve. Her scribes teach 
nothing, and can teach nothing; so her disciples can 
learn nothing. The milked goat and the sieve full of holes 
remain. 

But read, my dear reader, this little book,

and keep it, in which you can see how faithfully and truly 
the pope and his own boast of the holy church shepherds 
and bishops; you will also understand what St. Peter 
means 2 Petr. 2, 13. 14. when he says: "They splurge on 
your own and have a heart driven by avarice". Is the 
Roman court nothing but such avarice that all men's 
hearts cannot comprehend. | still remember the Imperial 
Diet at Augsburg in 1518 (twenty years have passed), 
that Pope Leo and his chamberlain Clemens Septimus 
devised this mischievousness, how they exhausted the 
whole of Germany through the annals and other money 
grabs reported in this booklet, and pretended with 
outrageous, impudent lies that they wanted to collect a 
treasure against the Turks, so that the clergy should give 
a tithe of their goods, the rich laymen a twentieth, the 
poor a fiftieth; thought that the German beasts should 
provide such an account. But God gave mercy, that it 
was rejected. For there were people who thought about 
it, and thought about it according to arithmetic, who said: 
Where this estimate would have stood three years in the 
German land, it would have been completely exhausted, 
and yet the money would not have perished against the 
Turks, but, like the annatas, also shamefully. 

After that, Pope Clement sent out a bulla, called 
Mons fidei, in which he grabbed the money of all kings 
and princes, even under the pretense of opposing the 
Turks. But he also lacked it by God's grace. When will 
we Germans wake up and realize (where we cannot see 
it) how shamefully the popes, cardinals and Roman 
villains have cheated us, robbed us, robbed us and 
cheated us, how miserably they have cheated us of body 
and soul, and how they are still unwilling and unable to 
stop inflicting on us all plagues on body, goods and soul? 
Well, God will do it; He has begun to reach into their 
entrenchment. And even if we drunken Germans do not 
want to feel it, He still feels what the Roman devil's bride 
has done against Him, and He will not forget it nor let it 
go, amen.

Short historical news from the Imperial Diet at 
Nuremberg. 1) 


When at the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg, begun in 
the fifteen hundred and twenty-second year, but 
ended in the twenty-third year, a papal message 
appeared, the same orator delivered to Imperial 
Majesty governors, princes, princes and other estates 
a papal decree, Princes and other Estates, advertised 
it and subsequently handed over his instruction 
concerning the Lutheran trade, and received an 
answer to all of this from the Imperial Majesty's 
Governors, Princes, Princes and other common 
Estates. And in addition to the same common 
response, the secular estates in particular have put 
their noticeably high and unpleasant complaints, 
which they encounter from the See of Rome and 
other ecclesiastical estates, in writings and have had 
them submitted to papal sanctity, as all this follows 
in different ways. 

And after the above-mentioned imperial majesty's 
governor's and imperial estates' answer, given to the 
papal orator, among other things the annata, which 
the newly elected archbishops, bishops and prelates, 
against the concordata and treaties, urge to give to 
Rome, as a great unrighteous 


1) The following is added to the preceding preface in Walch's old 
edition. It seems to be taken from the book itself. 





They are attracted to the same burdens, and desire 
the same annotations, which please the German 
lands, as necessary for the maintenance of their 
common benefit. And the more it is understood how 
a considerable sum of money these annals all cost, 
some special persons of good opinion have inquired 
how the archbishoprics, bishoprics and prelatures, 
not only in German lands, but also in other nations 
are called, which give the annals to Rome, also how 
much each such archbishop and prelate has to pay 
for these annals. And what has therefore been 
explored and recorded in a hurry is also found here 
after the end of the above-mentioned secular state 
afflictions, with a special preface 2) for this purpose, 
from which the other bishoprics and prelatures, if 
such a list does not attack, and what they give for 
annals to Rome, can also be found out in greater 
detail, and everything is printed for the sake of the 
common good. 


2) This will refer to the following preface, which, as we see here, 
has its place in the book "after the end of the hundred complaints, 
which the princes and imperial estates have indicated as such, which 
should not be tolerated any longer by the popes", and before the 
enumeration of the annotations. Compare the Latin title of the book,

Lord. 

In my opinion and advice, our people would do very 
well to take care that this and similar books are 
preserved for the descendants, in order to explain the 
unbelievable and innumerable tricks of the 





It is the only way to perceive and consign to memory the 
evil of Satan that reigns in the Roman court, the den of 
sin and corruption. For so often has this pernicious chair 
been attacked, both by kings and by learned men, that 
it should fall, but since the powerful error retained the 
upper hand

by cunning, trickery and practices not invented by human 
reason but by the devil's art alone, he has so far 
remained victorious and has thrown the truth to the 
ground in the streets (as Daniel prophesied before, and 
afterwards Christ together with the apostles). Fattened by 
these victories, grown fat and thick, puffed up and 
hopeful, these purple-clad tyrants confidently console 
themselves, and not only do they not abandon hope in 
this their tribulation, which they now suffer from the 
breath of Christ's lips and from the rod of his mouth, but 
are quite sure that the little ship of Peter (that is what they 
call their most harmful puddle of Satan's dung) will finally 
emerge from these floods with great happiness and rise 
higher than it has ever been. 

This is the confidence from which they at this time play 
their game with the affairs, senses and hearts of the 
whole human race, yes, with the spirit of the faithful and 
of the holy church (because they consider neither the 
church nor the spirit nor God to be anything at all), by 
reforming in a deceitful manner, sometimes the Roman 
court, sometimes the church, soon announcing a 
concilium and then revoking it, soon postponing it and 
announcing it again, and yet not wanting a concilium to 
come about, so that you can see that this one thing is 
certainly true, that the whole crowd of kings, princes, 
good, learned and holy people are taken by them for 
fools, stick-fools, ridiculous people and _play-dolls. 
Although they suffer the same for a short time, as if they 
were people who are drunk and make a racket for an hour 





They are sure that, when their noise and drunkenness 
cease, they will soon be the lords and gods of these 
fools, seven times more glorious than they had been 
before. These hopes they reflect to themselves not 
without reason by examples, because they would have 
suffered before, and indeed often, revolts of the princes 
and the peoples, also of the city of Rome itself. And yet 
they are not at all overcome by these wars, but through 
them their power, strength, victory, praise, honor and 
glory have increased, until they have not only made 
themselves kings over kings and lords over lords, but 
have stepped on the necks of kings, made the thrones 
of judges subservient to themselves and even set 
themselves up as gods over the gods in heaven, on 
earth, in the sea and in hell. This is their secret trust and 
they are aware of it. Thus their flatterers write: The pope 
is neither a mere god nor a mere man, but a mixed god 
and man, a lord of the heavenly angels 2c. 

Since this confidence reigns in their hearts (but it 
reigns with a constant and everlasting obstinacy and 
hopefulness, which they will not allow to be revoked, not 
even when they are dead, not even on a day of 
judgment, let alone through any tribulation of this life), 
everything that is undertaken to assemble a council, to 
improve the church, to reform the Roman court, is done 
in vain. Mau tells a story to a dove and addresses his 
words to a dead man, if one does not admit, admit, yes, 
decides as an article of faith that they are gods of heaven 
and earth, 





In his preface to the 14th volume, p. 44, Walch says that, since these editions are not preceded by our preface, but by another one, namely 
the preceding one, another edition must have been prepared by Luther, for which he wrote this preface. Probably for this reason, Walch has 
given our preface the year 1545, which is not further motivated. He also adds: "I cannot say how this [edition] is, because | cannot find it 
anywhere and therefore have not seen it. We consider the number 1545 to be erroneous, and find convinced that this preface also belongs 
to the year 1538. We have already cited two witnesses for this, namely firstly the Wittenberg edition, vol. IX, p. 164 b and secondly the book 
itself, which indicates that this preface is not before the edition of 1538, but in the book. Walch seems to have overlooked this. We think we 
find a third witness in the title of the Latin edition itself: bum praekutione 6t sprVo“o Martini Dutberi, which in any case points to our preface, 
whether one refers the word epilo“us to this entire preface as an epilogue to the Complaints of the German Imperial Estates, or to the parody 
of Rom. Il, 33-36, which at the same time can be seen as a preface to the following list of the Annateu. This preface is found in Latin in 
Célestin's Historia ooinitiornm XnAnstae Vindeboorum oolebratornin, tom. Ill, p. 89; thereafter in des Buddeus Knppleruentum opistoinrum M. 
Dnitberi, p. 315 and thereafter in the Erlangen edition, opp. var. ar’., tom. VII, p. 544. German in the Leipzig edition, vol. XXII, appendix, p. 140 
and in Walch. We have retranslated according to the Erlangen edition.

not subject to the council, nor equals, but superiors and 
irrefutable judges. Do not doubt that this is told to you 
not by an oracle but from heaven. | know, and many with 
me, | say, we know the manner of popes and cardinals, 
and even the most secret, not only in their chambers, 
but also in their thoughts and speeches, as promised by 
the Heartspeaker, Christ, who made and formed hearts 
(Luc. 12, 3.]: "What ye say in darkness shall be heard in 
the light; what ye speak in the ear in the chambers shall 
be preached upon the housetops." But that these people 
at the Roman court, similar to Nero and Domitian, do not 
fear this, is due to the extremely beautiful and quite 
certain belief of the popes and cardinals, namely: the life 
after death (Manes) is a fable. But experience, which 
teaches things as they are, will teach them otherwise, 
and that in a short time. 

Therefore, if this and similar books (as | have said) 
are preserved and brought to the descendants, it will be 
useful and salutary, not only for Germany, but also for 
the whole world, against this exceedingly harmful 
mountain of the Roman Babel, which corrupts all the 
world (to use the words of Jeremiah [Cap. 51, 25.]). For 
here you see that the princes of Germany, who have 
finally awakened from a deep sleep, 1) have dared to 
say to the face of the pope and the Roman court (that is 
the dunghill) what he could not hear, cannot hear and 
will not be able to hear. And they have not been moved 
(which is a miracle) by the splendid pretence and the 
arts of the Roman court, which one reads here in the 
message of the Roman pope

Annaten, die sie gen Rom geben" Walch, old edition, vol. XV, 460 ff. 
closes with the words Rom. 13, 11: "Brethren, it is time to rise from 
sleep." 


can. And if the devil had not hindered this happy course 
of the Gospel and the flourishing of the truth by the 
rebellion of Munzer and the sects of the adversaries, this 
papal confidence would have been overcome at that 
time, and this hope of Jordan, which sells _ itself 
deceitfully under the name of Christ and the church, 
would have fallen long ago. But if the German 
descendants return to the attitude of their fathers and 
princes, who greeted the pope so sweetly at this Imperial 
Diet at Nuremberg, then it will undoubtedly be over with 
the futile pretenses, tricks, practices and lies of the pope 
and his completely cursed court, which is worthy of all 
curses, even those of Hercules at Lindos 2). Let this be 
done by the Father of mercies and the God of all power 
through Jesus Christ, who already kills the wicked by the 
spirit of his mouth, and after he has put an end to him by 
the appearance of his future, he delivers us from the evil, 
amen. 


Epilogue. 
Martin Luther. 


O what a depth of his wickedness, his avarice, and 
his robbery! How innumerable are his thefts and 
immeasurable his robberies! For who has known the 
shrine of his heart? Or who has given anything to the 
church before that he has not robbed afterwards? For 
from him, through him and in him are all the evils of the 
church. To him be horror and shame for all eternity. 
Amen. 

From this, dear reader, recognize what it is that St. 
Peter says of the papacy, 2 Pet. 2:14: "They have a heart 
pierced with avarice."

54: Preface to the Canticles of the Passion of Christ. *) 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


Hail in Christ! | would certainly like with all my heart that 
the divine and exceedingly glorious gift, music, be 
praised and extolled to all, but | am so overwhelmed by 
the quantity and greatness of its excellence and good 
qualities that | can find neither beginning nor end nor a 
way of speaking, so that | must be a meager and poor 
eulogist in the highest abundance of praise. For who 
could possibly sum up everything? And if you wanted to 
summarize everything, you would be considered as if 
you had summarized nothing. First of all, if you look at 
the thing itself, you will find that music has been 
implanted or given to all creatures from the beginning of 
the world. For there is nothing without a sound or 
sonorous music, so that even the air, which in itself 
cannot be seen nor touched, and is imperceptible to all 
the senses, and of all things is least musical, but rather 
quite mute and considered to be nothing, is 
nevertheless, when moved, sonorous and audible, then 
also palpable; wherein the spirit displays marvelous 
mysteries, of which it is not the place here to speak. But 
still more wonderful is the music in living creatures, 
especially the birds, as the very musical king and divine 
Psalmist David praises with immense wonder and 
exultant spirit the wonderful skill and assurance of the 
birds in singing, saying in the 104th Psalm, v. 12.: "By 
the waters sit the birds of the air, and sing among the 
branches." But against the human voice, everything is 
actually unmusical: so great is the over 


effusive and incomprehensible mildness and wisdom of 
the kind Creator in this matter. 

The world's ants have labored to discover the 
marvelous work of art of the human voice, how the air, 
struck by such a light movement of the tongue and an 
even lighter movement of the throat, can produce the 
infinite variety and articulation of voice and words 
according to the will of the governing soul, and so 
powerfully and strongly that through such great distances 
all around it can not only be heard but also understood 
by all. But they only struggle, they never find it, and with 
admiration they must desist and marvel. Yes, no one has 
yet been found who could explain and determine what 
the whispering and a kind of ABC of the human voice or 
the coarse material (materia prima) is; namely the 
laughter (I will not say anything about crying) they 
admire, but do not understand it. But we want to leave 
these researches about the infinite wisdom of God in this 
One Creature to people who understand it better and 
have more time; we hardly get a sample of it. 

Here we should speak of the use of such a great 
thing, but even this, in its infinite variety and usefulness, 
is much too high for the greatest eloquence of all the 
most eloquent people. Only this one thing we can now 
mention- that experience testifies that it is music alone 
which, according to the words of God, is rightly called the 
mistress and

Music should be praised as the regent of the human 
heart movements 1) (of the animals we have to be silent 
now), by which the people are ruled as by their masters 
and are often carried away. A greater praise of music 
than this we cannot imagine. For if you want to either 
raise the sad, or frighten the happy. To encourage the 
despairing, to depress the hopeful, to calm the frenzied, 
to pacify the insubordinate-and who can enumerate all 
these masters of the human heart, namely the 
movements of the heart and the impulses or spirits that 
drive to all virtues or vices? - What can you find more 
effective than music? Even the Holy Spirit honors it as 
an instrument of his own ministry, since he testifies in his 
holy writings that through it his gifts come upon the 
prophets, that is, the impulse to all virtues, as is seen in 
Elisha; again, that through it the devil is cast out, that is, 
the one who impels to all vices, as is shown in Saul, the 
king of Israel. Therefore, the fathers and the prophets did 
not want in vain that nothing should be more closely 
connected with the word of God than music. For this is 
the origin of so many songs and psalms, in which both 
speech and voice work in the heart of the listener, while 
with other living creatures and bodies, music alone, 
without speech, makes gestures. Yes, speech and voice 
alone were given to man before others, so that he should 
know that he should praise God with words and music, 
namely by letting himself be heard with praises, and by 
mixing the words with a sweet melody. If you now make 
a comparison among men themselves, you will see how 
manifold and in many ways the Creator has shown 
Himself glorious in the distribution of the gifts of music, 
how different one man is from another in voice and word, 
that one exceeds the other extraordinarily. For 


1) Instead of effectuum in our template, affectuum will have to 
be read. 


One denies that even two people can be found who have 
the same voice and speech in all things, although one 
often sees that some imitate others, as some of the 
others are monkeys. 

But when finally the effort is added to improve, 
develop and unfold the natural disposition, then one can 
finally perceive with astonishment, but not comprehend, 
the unrestricted and perfect wisdom of God in this 
wonderful work of His in music. In this way, it is 
something outstanding that it is sung by one and the 
same voice, which continues in its course, while in the 
meantime several voices around it praise, rejoice and 
adorn it with exceedingly lovely gestures in a wonderful 
way, and, as it were, perform a kind of divine round 
dance next to it, so that to those who have even a little 
feeling, nothing more wonderful seems to exist in our 
time. But those who are not moved by this are indeed 
unmusical, and worth listening to some shitty poet or the 
music of pigs in the meantime. 

But the matter is too great for its many benefits to be 
described in such brevity. You, my dear young man, let 
this noble, wholesome and joyful creature be 
commanded to you, by means of which you, too, can at 
times come to the aid of your heart movements against 
shameful lusts and evil company. Then you should get 
used to recognizing and praising the Creator in this 
creature, and from the corrupt hearts, which abuse this 
very beautiful natural gift and art, like the lewd poets, for 
their nonsensical love affairs, you should guard yourself 
with the utmost diligence and avoid them, in the certainty 
that the devil will snatch them away against nature, since 
this alone wants and should praise God, who has 
bestowed it, with this gift. These bastards make a 
robbery out of the gift of God and worship with it the 
enemy of God and the adversary of nature and this 
exceedingly lovely art. Fare well in the Lord.

of his Writings. 


1. preface to the first part of his German books,*) 


Anno 1539. 


Preface by D. Martin Luther. 


| would gladly have seen that all my books would 
have remained behind and perished. And one of the 
reasons, among others, is that | am afraid of the 
example; for | can see what good has been done in the 
church, since, apart from and in addition to the holy 
Scriptures, they have begun to collect many books and 
large libraries, especially to gather all kinds of fathers, 
concilia and teachers without any distinction. So that not 
only the noble time and study of the Scriptures is missed, 
but also the pure knowledge of the divine Word is finally 
lost, until the Bible (as happened to the fifth book of 
Moses, in the time of the kings of Judah [2 Kings 22:8, 2 
Chron. 34:15]) is forgotten under the dust. 

(2) And although it is useful and necessary that some 
fathers' and conciliar writings have remained as 
witnesses and histories, | think it is modus in rebus, and 
not a pity that many fathers' and conciliar books have 
perished by God's grace. For where they all should have 
remained, no one should have been able to go in or out 
before the books, and would not have done better than 
what is found in the holy Scriptures. 

3 This was also our opinion when we began to 
translate the Biblia itself, that we hoped that there would 
be less writing and more studying and reading of the 
Scriptures. For also all other writing in and to the 
Scriptures, as John 





to Christ; as he says: "| must decrease, he must 
increase" [Joh. 3, 30.], so that everyone himself may 
drink from the fresh spring, as all fathers, who want to 
do something good, must have done. For neither 
Concilia, the fathers, nor we shall do it so well, though it 
may be done in the highest and best way, as the holy 
Scriptures, that is, God Himself has done, though we 
must have the Holy Spirit, faith, divine speech and work, 
if we are to be saved, as we must let the prophets and 
apostles sit on the pulpit, and we hear here at their feet 
what they say; and not say what they must hear. 

But now that | cannot prevent it, and they want to 
collect my books through printing (in small honor of me) 
without my thanks, | must let them dare the cost and 
work on it. Comfort me that in time my books will remain 
forgotten in the dust, especially where | have written 
something good (by God's grace). Non ero melior 
patribus meis. The other should probably remain first. 
For if one can leave the Biblia itself under the bench, 
also the Fathers and Concilia, the better the more, 
forgotten, is good hope, when this time is atoned for, my 
books shall also not remain long, especially because it 
has begun to snow and rain with books and masters, 
which also already lie there much forgotten and 
decayed, that one can also forget them.

Names no longer remembered, who nevertheless freely 
hoped that they would be eternally on the market and 
master churches. 

Let him who wants to have my books at this time, let 
them by no means be an obstacle to studying the 
Scriptures themselves, but lay them out as | lay out the 
Pope's Drecket and Drecketal and the Sophists' books, 
that is, whether | want to see what they have done, or 
also to reckon the history of the time, not that | have to 
study in them, or do according to them what they have 
thought. | do not do much differently with the Fathers' and 
Conciliar books, and in this | follow the example of St. 
Augustine, who among others is the first and almost the 
only one who wants to be free of all Fathers' and Holy 
Books, subject only to the Holy Scriptures, and about this 
got into a hard fight with St. Jerome, who reproached him 
with his ancestors’ books; but he did not turn back. And 
if such an example of St. Augustine had been followed, 
the pope would not have become an antichrist, and the 
innumerable vermin, worms and ulcers of the books 
would not have come into the church, and the Biblia 
would probably have remained in the pulpit. 

6th About this | will show you a proper way to study 

theology, which | have practiced; where you hold the 
same, you shall be taught so that you yourself could (if it 
were necessary) even make as good books as the 
fathers and Concilia. As | may (in God) also presume and 
boast without arrogance and lies, that | would not give 
some of the fathers much before, if it should apply to 
bookmaking; of life | can boast far not equally. And this 
is the way that the holy king David (no doubt also held by 
all patriarchs and prophets) teaches in the 119th Psalm; 
there you will find three rules inside, abundantly 
presented throughout the whole Psalm, and are thus 
called: Oratio, Meditatio, Tentatio. 
7 First of all, know that the Holy Scriptures are a book 
that makes folly of all other books, because none 
teaches about eternal life without this alone. Therefore, 
you must despair of your mind and your understanding, 
for you will not attain it with them, but with such 
presumptuousness you will not attain it. 


Prefaces by D. Martin Luther. ' W. XIV, 422-425. 





435 


yourself and others with you fall from heaven (as 
happened to Lucifer) into the abyss of hell. But kneel 
down in your closet, and pray to God with right humility 
and earnestness that He may give you His Holy Spirit 
through His dear Son, who will enlighten you, guide you 
and give you understanding. 

8 As you see that David always asks in the above 
psalm, "Teach me, O Lord, instruct me, guide me, show 
me," and many more words, even though he knew the 
text of Moses and other books well and heard and read 
them daily, yet he wants to have the right master of the 
Scriptures himself, so that he does not fall into error with 
his reason and become his own master. For there are 
the spirits of the mob, who make themselves believe that 
the Scriptures are subject to them, and can easily be 
obtained with their reason, as if it were Marcolfus or 
Aesopi's fables, since they are not allowed to have the 
Holy Spirit or to pray. 

(9) Secondly, meditate, that is, not only in the heart, 
but also outwardly, always practicing and practicing the 
verbal speech and literal words in the book, 1) reading 
and rereading, with diligent attention and reflection, what 
the Holy Spirit means by it. And beware lest you get tired 
of it, or think that you have read, heard, and said it once 
or twice enough, and understand it all too well; for there 
is no special theologian "more and more out, and are like 
the untimely fruit that falls off before it is half ripe. 

10 Therefore you see in the same Psalm how David 
always boasts that he will speak, write, say, sing, listen, 
read, day and night and forever, but nothing but God's 
word and commandments. For God will not give you His 
Spirit without the outward word, so judge yourself; for He 
has not commanded it in vain to write, preach, read, 
hear, sing, say outwardly 2c. 

(11) The third is tentation, which is the touchstone 
that teaches you not only to know and understand, but 
also to know how right, how true, how sweet, how lovely, 
how powerful, how comforting God's word is, wisdom 
above all wisdom.

437 





(12) Therefore, you see how David so often complains 
in the above Psalm about all kinds of enemies, evil 
princes or tyrants, about false spirits and mobs that he 
has to suffer, because he meditates, that is, deals with 
God's word (as | said) in all kinds of ways. For as soon 
as God's word rises through you, the devil will visit you, 
make you a right doctor, and teach you to seek and love 
God's word through his temptation. For | myself (that |, 
too, mingle with the mice) have a great deal to thank my 
papists for having so crushed, crushed and crushed me 
through the devil's ravings, that is, for having made me 
a pretty good theologian, where otherwise | would not 
have come. And what they have gained in me, on the 
other hand, | am heartily grateful to them for the honor, 
victory and triumph, because that is how they wanted it. 

13 Seeing thou hast David's rule, study thou this 
example, and thou shalt sing and boast with him in the 
same psalm, v. 72: "The law of thy mouth is dearer unto 
me than many thousands of pieces of gold and silver. 
Item, vv. 98-100: "Thou makest me wiser with thy 
commandment than mine enemies are, for it is my 
treasure forever. | am more learned than all my teachers, 
for thy testimonies are my speech. | am wiser than the 
ancients, for | keep thy command" 2c. And you will 
experience how stale and rotten the books of the fathers 
will taste to you, you will not only despise the books of 
the adversaries, but you yourself will like both in writing 
and teaching the longer the less. When you have come 
here, hope confidently that you have begun to become 
a true theologian, who may teach not only the young, 
imperfect Christians, but also the growing and perfect 
ones; for Christ's church has all kinds of Christians in it, 
young, old, weak, sick, healthy, strong, fresh, lazy, 
foolish, wise 2c. 





(14) But if thou feelest, and thinkest thyself to be sure of 
it, and tickleest thyself with thy own books, doctrines, or 
writings, as if thou hadst made it very delicious, and 
preachedst excellently, thou likest also very much to be 
praised before others, thou mayest also want to be praised, 
or else thou wouldest grieve or desist. If thou art the hair, 
beloved, take hold of thine own ears, and if thou take hold 
aright, thou shalt find a goodly pair of large, long, rough 
ass's ears; then dare to taste them, and adorn them with 
golden bells, that where thou walkest, they may hear thee, 
and point to thee with fingers, and say, Behold, behold, 
there goeth his beast, that can write such excellent books, 
and preach so well. Then you are blessed and blissful in 
the kingdom of heaven; yes, since the hellish fire has been 
prepared for the devil and his angels. Summa, let us seek 
honor and be arrogant wherever we may. In this book, 
God's honor alone is called: Deus superbis resistit, 
humilibus autem dat gratiam. Cui est gloria in secula 
seculorum, Amen. 


1) Let Luther's books large and small be 
commanded to you with diligence. Therein is 
rightly revealed 
The pope, the true antichrist, 
And brought back the bright light, The gospel 
pure preaching. 
Thank God, therefore, Germany, for such 
good, which he shows you in this, 
And think of the laudable Princely Graces, Who 
have hereby promoted you 
To such a great treasure of souls; To the 
faithful God do they command.

The 5th of March Anno 1545.

Martin Luther wishes salvation to the godly reader! 

Many times and for a long time | have resisted those 
who wanted to see my books or, more correctly, the 
jumble of my interpretations published, partly because | 
did not want the works of the ancients to be displaced by 
my new things and the reader to be prevented from 
reading them; Secondly, because by the grace of God 
there are now many well-prepared books available, 
among which the loci communes of Philip stand out, by 
which a theologian and a bishop can be beautifully and 
abundantly prepared to be able to present the doctrine 
of godliness, especially since the Holy Bible is now 
available in almost every language. My books, however, 
as this brought about the confusion of events, even 
necessitated it, are also a kind of raw and disordered 
chaos, which is not easy for me to order. 

Moved by these reasons, | wished that all my books 
were buried in eternal oblivion, so that better ones would 
have a place. But the urging and the impetuous 
obstinacy of others, which were daily before my ears: it 
would happen, if | would not allow in my life that they 
would be published, but after my death certainly such 
people would publish them, who would not know at all 
the causes and times of the events, and so from one 
confusion very many would become: their urging (I say) 
has overcome me, so that | allowed that they would be 
published. For this is at the same time the will and 
command of our 





res most illustrious Prince John Frederick, Elector 2c., 
who commanded, even forced the printers, not only to 
print the books, but also to accelerate their publication. 

But above all, | ask the godly reader, and ask him for 
the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he read this with 
good judgment, yes, with much mercy. And he should 
know that | was a monk and an exceedingly nonsensical 
pope when | started this thing, so drunk, even drowned 
in the teachings of the pope, that | would have been 
completely ready, if | had been able, to kill everyone or 
to help those and to keep it with those who killed those 
who refused to obey the pope even with one syllable. 
Such a great Saul was I, as there are still many. | was 
not so ice and cold in defending the papacy as Eck and 
his kind were, who rather seemed to me to defend the 
pope for the sake of their belly than to have acted 
seriously in the matter; yes, they seem to me even today 
to ridicule the pope, like the Epicureans. | acted 
seriously, because | feared the last day in a frightening 
way, and yet desired from the bottom of my heart to be 
blessed. Thus you will find in these earlier writings of 
mine how many and great things | have most humbly 
admitted to the pope, which in later times and now | 
consider and curse as the highest blasphemy and 
atrocity. You will therefore, dear godly reader, this error 
or (as they blaspheme it) mutually contradictory 
speeches of time and 


*Luther wrote this preface for the first part of his Latin writings, which came out in Wittenberg in 1545, printed by Johannes Luft. The 
title of the first volume is: Tomus primus omnium operum Reverendi Domini Martini Lutheri, Doctoris theologiae, Continens

to my ignorance. | was alone at first, and certainly quite | | am summoned to Rome, and the whole papacy rises 


unskilled and too unlearned to do such great things, for 
by chance, not willingly and intentionally, | got into this 
trouble; for this | call God Himself to witness. 

Since in 1517 indulgences were sold (proclaimed, | 
mean to say) in these lands for the sake of the most 
shameful profit, | was at that time a preacher, a young 
doctor of theology (as one is wont to say), and began to 
dissuade the people and admonish them not to give ear 
to the criers of indulgences; they had better things to do. 
And | believed that | would have the pope as my patron 
in this, on whose reliability | relied very much at that time, 
since in his decrees he condemns in the clearest 
possible way the impudent activities of the indulgence 
preachers (quaestorum - the "Schésser" - that is what 
he calls them). 

Immediately | wrote two letters, one to the archbishop 
of Mainz, Albrecht, 1) who received half of the money 
from the indulgence; the other half was given to the 
pope, which | did not know at the time; the other letter to 
the ordinary bishop of our place (ordinarium loci, as it is 
called), the bishop of Brandenburg, Jerome, 2) asking 
that they stop the impudence and blasphemy of the 
indulgence merchants, but the poor little monk (orator) 
was despised. 3) Since | was so despised, | issued a 
disputation note 4) and at the same time a German 
sermon on indulgences, shortly thereafter also the 
explanations, in which | acted in honor of the pope, that 
indulgences should not be condemned, but the good 
works of love should be preferred to it. 

That was as much as if | had thrown down the sky 
and consumed the whole world with a conflagration. | am 
accused before the pope, a citation is sent in which

up against me as a single man. This happened in 1518 
during the Imperial Diet held by Maximilian in Augsburg, 
at which Cardinal Cajetan was active as the Pope's 
legate a latere. The most illustrious Duke of Saxony, 
Frederick, Elector, turned to him and obtained that | 
should not be forced to go to Rome, but that he himself 
should summon me, investigate the matter and settle it. 
Soon after, the Diet was dissolved. 

In the meantime, because all Germans were tired of 
suffering the plundering, the fair and the innumerable 
frauds of the Roman boys, they waited with great desire 
for the outcome of such a great matter, which neither a 
bishop nor a theologian had dared to touch before. And 
in any case, this mood of the people was favorable to 
me, because all of them already hated the artifices and 
Roman practices (Romanationes) with which they had 
filled and tired the whole world. 

Therefore | came to Augsburg on foot and poor, 
provided by Prince Frederick with food and letters of 
recommendation to the council and several good men. | 
was there for three days before | went to the Cardinal, 
for these good people kept me away, and most strongly 
recanted that | should go to the Cardinal without a safe 
conduct from the Emperor, although he had me 
summoned every day by some orator. This made me 
very uncomfortable: that | should only recant, then 
everything would be fine. But it is too extensive, the 
unjust request, too extensive to tell his circumlocutions. 

Finally, on the third day, he came and complained 
why | did not come to the Cardinal, who was waiting for 
me in the kindest spirit. | answered that | had to obey the 
advice of the good men to whom | had been 
recommended by Prince Frederick. But it was their 
advice that | should not go to the Cardinal without the 
Emperor's protection or public escort; when | had 
obtained this (but they worked with the Imperial Council 
to obtain it), then | would go to him immediately. Then he 
said indignantly: Do you think that Prince Frederick 
would go to him for your sake? 


442 V-a-1, 18 f. 


| will take up arms? | said: | certainly didn't want to do 
that. And where do you want to stay? | answered: "Under 
heaven. Then he said: If you had the Pope and the 
Cardinals in your power, what would you do? | would pay 
them all homage and honor, | said. Then he moved his 
finger with a French gesture and said: Hem. And so he 
left and did not come back. 

On that day the imperial council told the cardinal that 
the emperor had given me protection or safe conduct 
and reminded him not to do anything too harsh against 
me. To this he replied: It is good; nevertheless | will do 
what is my duty. These were the beginnings of this trade; 
other things can be seen from the acts that follow 1). 

In the same year, M. Philipp Melanchthon was called 
here by Prince Frederick to teach the Greek sciences, 
no doubt so that | would have a helper in the work of 
theology. For what the Lord has wrought through this 
instrument not only in the sciences but also in theology, 
his works sufficiently testify, even though Satan is angry 
about it and all his scales. 

In the following year, 1519, Maximilian died in 
February, and according to the law of the realm, Duke 
Frederick became governor. Thereupon the storm 
ceased to rage a little, and contempt for the ban or the 
papal thunderclap gradually set in. For since Eck and 
Caracciolus had brought a bull from Rome condemning 
Luther, and they had made it known, that [Eck] here [in 
Wittenberg], that [Caracciolus] there to Duke Frederick, 
who was then at Cologne to receive the recently elected 
Carl with other princes, he [Elector Frederick's] was very 
unwilling, and with great valor and constancy scolded 
this papal knave, that he and Eck in his absence had 
disturbed the territory of his brother John and his own, 
and put them to the sword, so that they were put to 
shame

and left him in disgrace. The prince, who was gifted with 
incredible intellect, recognized the tricks of the Roman 
court and knew how to treat these people properly, for 
he had a very fine nose and sensed more and further 
than the Romanists could hope or fear. 

Therefore, from then on, they refrained from trying 
him. For even the rose, which is called the golden one, 
2) which had been sent to him in the same year by Leo 
X, he did not dignify, but rather considered it something 
ridiculous; so the Romanists had to despair of their 
intention to deceive this so great prince. And the Gospel 
had a happy progress under the shadow of this prince 
and was widely spread. His reputation moved many, 
since he was a very wise and perceptive prince and 
could only be suspected by spiteful people that he 
wanted to cherish and protect heresy and heretics. This 
brought great harm to the papacy. 

In the same year, the disputation was held in Leipzig, 
to which Eck challenged both of us, Carlstadt and me. 
But | could not obtain escort from Duke Georg through 
any letters, so that | entered Leipzig under the escort 
given to Carlstadt, as one who would not be a disputator, 
but a spectator. | do not know, however, who might have 
hindered me, for Duke Georg was not yet averse to me, 
which | certainly knew. 

Here Eck came to me at my inn and said that he had 
heard that | refused to dispute. | answered: How can | 
dispute, since | cannot obtain an escort from Duke 
George? He said: "If | am not allowed to dispute with 
you, | do not want to dispute with Carlstadt either, 
because | have come here for your sake. How? if | 
obtained escort for you, would you then dispute with 
me? Obtain it (| said), and it shall be done. He left, and 
immediately he was given safe conduct and the 
opportunity to argue. 

This thaf Eck, because he saw that he could hunt 
certain fame, because of my thesis, in

| denied that the pope was the head of the church by}1 Petr. 2, 13. Therefore | can bear with a not at all angry 


divine right. Here a wide field was open to him and the 
best opportunity to flatter with great pretense and to earn 
the papal grace, then also to shower me with hatred and 
disgrace. He did this bravely during the whole 
disputation; but he did not prove his case, nor did he 
refute mine, so that even Duke George said to Eck and 
me at the morning meal: "May he be pope by human right 
or by divine right, he is still pope. He would not have said 
this under any circumstances if he had not been moved 
by my reasons for proof, but he alone would have agreed 
with Eck. 
And here, too, see in my case how difficult it is to wrestle 
oneself out of such errors, which are fixed by the example 
of the whole world and have become, as it were, nature 
through long habit. How true is the proverb: It is difficult 
to give up habitual things, and: Habit is second nature; 
and how true Augustine says: Habit, if one does not resist 
it, becomes a necessity. I, who at that time had already 
read and taught the holy Scriptures privately and publicly 
for seven years in the most diligent manner, so that | 
knew almost everything by heart; then | had also acquired 
the first fruits of the knowledge and faith of Christ, 
namely, that we are not justified and saved by works, but 
by faith in Christ; Yes, even that of which | am now 
speaking, that the pope is not the head of the church by 
divine right, had already publicly defended, but still did 
not see what followed from it, namely, that the pope is 
necessarily a consecrated man of the devil. For what is 
not of God must be of the devil. 

| was so overwhelmed (as | have said) both by the 
example and the title of the holy church and by my own 
custom that | conceded to the pope a human right, which, 
if it is not based on a saying of the holy scripture, is a lie 
and devilish. For we obey parents and authorities, not 
because they command it, but because this is the will of 
God, 





heart those who are extremely stubbornly attached to the 
papacy, especially those who have not read the holy 
scriptures or even secular writings, since | have read the 
holy scriptures most diligently for so many years and yet 
have clung to them so tenaciously. 

In 1519 (as | have said) the Pope Leo X sent the Rose 
through Carl Miltitz, who acted a lot with me, so that | 
would be reconciled with the Pope again. He had seventy 
apostolic letters (brevia), so that if Prince Frederick 
handed me over to him, as the Pope sought through the 
rose, he should post a breve in every city, and thus bring 
me safely to Rome. But he betrayed the counsel of his 
heart before me by saying: "O Martinus, | thought you 
were some old aged theologian, sitting behind the stove 
and disputing with yourself, but now | see that you are 
still young in years and strong. If | had twenty-five 
thousand armed men, | would not dare to bring you to 
Rome. For | have searched all along the way the minds 
of the people, what they thought of thee: behold, if | found 
one who held with the pope, three stood for thee and 
against the pope. But this was a ridiculous incident: he 
had also searched out the women and virgins in the inns, 
what they thought of the Roman See? Since they did not 
know this word, and thought it was an ordinary chair, they 
answered: How can we know what kind of chairs you 
have in Rome, whether wooden or stone? 

Therefore, he asked that | also be mindful of what 
would serve peace; he would make every effort that the 
pope would do the same. | also promised abundantly 
everything. Whatever | could do in any way with an 
unblemished conscience, that | would not forgive 
anything to the truth, | would do most willingly. | also 
desire peace and strive for it, since | was drawn into this 
trade by force; driven by necessity, | would have done 
everything that | have done. The fault is not mine. 

He had, however, summoned Johann Tetzel, Order of 
Preachers, the first author

The pope's words and threats so devastated this man, 
who had hitherto been a terrible man to everyone and a 
fearless screamer, that he pined away from then on and 
was finally taken away by the sorrow of his heart. When 
| first learned of this, | comforted him before his death 
with kindly written letters and urged him to be of good 
cheer and not to fear the memory of me. But perhaps he 
is defeated by his conscience and the wrath of the pope. 

Carl [von Miltitz] was considered unfit, and his 
counsel null and void; but - in my opinion - if the Mainzer 
had taken this counsel from the beginning, when he was 
reminded by me, yes, if the pope, before he condemned 
me unheard and raged with his bulls, had taken this 
counsel that Carl took, albeit late, and had immediately 
quelled Tetzel's raging, the matter would not have 
become such a big hullabaloo. Only the Mainzer is to 
blame, whose wisdom and cunning deceived him, 
because he wanted to muffle my teaching, and wanted 
to keep his money, which he sought through the 
indulgence, unabated. Now one seeks counsel in vain, in 
vain one makes efforts. The Lord has awakened and sets 
out to judge the nations. Even if they could kill us, they 
would not have what they want, indeed, they would have 
much less than they have with our lives, and since we 
are unharmed. Some of them, who are not completely 
without a fine nose, feel this very well. 

In the meantime, | had started again this year to 
interpret the Psalter, 1) trusting that | would be more 
practiced after | had treated the letters of St. Paul to the 
Romans, to the Galatians, and the one addressed to the 
Hebrews in school. | had, of course, striven with an 
extraordinary eagerness to understand Paul in the letter 
to the Romans, but it was not the cold blood that flows 
around the heart that stood in my way, 2) but the few 
words that are written in Cap. 1, 17 [Vulg.] 


1) These are "Luther's Works on the First 22 Psalms," Walch, St. 
Louis Edition, Vol. IV, 198. a got Bow 7

praecordia sanguls. 





revealed in the same." For | hated this word: "The justice 
of God", because | was so instructed by the custom and 
habit of all teachers that | should understand it in a 
philosophical way, from the formal or active justice (as 
they call it), according to which God is just and punishes 
the sinners and the unjust. 

But |, who, however blamelessly | lived as a monk, found 
myself a sinner before God and had a very troubled 
conscience, and could not even grasp the confidence 
that He would be reconciled by my satisfaction, did not 
love the righteous God who punishes sinners; indeed, | 
hated Him. And even if not with secret blasphemy, | was 
certainly angry with God with tremendous grumbling, 
saying: "As if it were not enough that the wretched 
sinners, eternally lost through original sin, are burdened 
with every kind of misfortune through the law of the holy 
Ten Commandments, - must God also heap misery upon 
misery through the Gospel, and threaten us with His 
justice and wrath through the Gospel as well? So | raged 
in my evil and troubled conscience, but | impetuously 
knocked on Paul's door at this point, thirsting most 
intensely to know what St. Paul meant. 

Finally, as | pondered this day and night, by God's grace 
| paid attention to the context, namely: The 
righteousness of God is revealed in this, as it is written: 
The righteous lives by faith. Then | began to understand 
that the righteousness of God is that by which the 
righteous lives through the gift of God, namely, through 
faith, and that this is the opinion: through the gospel the 
righteousness of God is revealed, namely, the suffering 
(passive) righteousness, by which the merciful God 
justifies us through faith, as it is written: The righteous 
lives by faith. Then | felt that | was completely born again 
and that | had entered paradise through the open doors. 
Immediately the whole scripture seemed to me to have a 
completely different appearance. Then | went through 
the Scriptures, as far as | had them in my memory, and 
found also in other words the same expression 
(analogiam) as, the work of God, i.e., which 


448 Erl. 63, 327 f. Prefaces On Collections of L.'s Writings 


GOD works on us; the power of GOD by which He makes 
us strong; the wisdom of GOD by which He makes us 
wise; the strength of GOD, the salvation of GOD, the 
glory of GOD. 

With how great hatred | had previously hated the 
word "the righteousness of God", with such great love | 
held up this word as the one that was most dear to me. 
Thus, this passage of Paul was indeed the gate of 
paradise for me. Later, | read Augustine's writing "On the 
Spirit and the Letter", where, contrary to my expectations, 
| found that he also interprets the righteousness of God 
in the same way as the righteousness with which God 
clothes us by making us righteous. And although this is 
still imperfectly spoken, and does not clearly express 
everything that concerns imputation, it pleased me 
nevertheless that the righteousness of God is taught, by 
which we are made righteous. 

Through these thoughts | was now better equipped, 
and began to interpret the Psalter for the second time, 
and the work would have become a great commentary, if 
| had not been compelled anew by the Imperial Diet, 
which Emperor Carl V held at Worms, since | was called 
there in the following year. 


. W. XIV, 462-468. 449

would have been to leave the work in progress. 

| am telling you this, dear reader, so that when you 
read my works you may remember that (as | said above) 
| have been one of those who (as Augustine writes of 
himself) have progressed by writing and teaching, not 
one of those who from nothing at once become the 
highest, while they are nothing: neither having worked, 
nor tried, nor experienced, but by One Look at the 
Scriptures exhausting their whole: spirit. 

Up to here, until the years 1520 and 1521, the trade 
in indulgences extended; after that follow the matters 
concerning the Sacramentarians and the Anabaptists, 
about which, if | live, the preface shall be placed in other 
volumes. 

Fare well in the Lord, dear reader, and pray that the 
word may grow and increase against Satan, because he 
is powerful and evil, now also exceedingly angry and 
furious, knowing that he has only a short time and that 
the kingdom of his pope is in danger. But may God 
strengthen us in the error he has wrought, and may he 
accomplish the work he has begun in us for his glory, 
amen. March 5, 1545.

the Reformation until 1538, *) 


1538. 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


Doctor Martin Luther to the Godly Reader. 


| allow my disputations or theses, which have been 
treated from the beginning of my cause against the 
Pabstacy and the Sophists, who had the rule, to be 
published, primarily so that the greatness of the 
cause and the success, which is given to me by God 
in it, does not elevate me. For in these my shame is 
publicly shown. 





That is, my weakness and ignorance, which in the 
beginning forced me to attack the matter with the 
greatest trepidation. 


| was alone, and got into this matter through 
imprudence; since | was not allowed to withdraw my 
foot, | not only yielded to the pope in many and great 
articles, but also continued to worship him. For who 
was | at that time? A very miserable 





*The first collection of disputations held at Wittenberg, to which this preface is attached, seems to be the one that has the title:

in the Erlangen, opp. vur. ur’., toru. IV, p. 329. In German, this preface appears in the editions under the heading: "Vorrede D. Mart. Luthers

misapprehension that our preface belonged to the 95 Theses published on Oct. 31, 1517, and therefore made the remark in the 18th volume 
of the old edition (Col. 254): "Luthers

| was a poor little monk, more like a corpse than a man, 
that | should act contrary to the majesty of the pope, 
before whose face not only the kings of the earth and the 
whole world, but also heaven and hell (as they say: trina 
rerum machina) feared, and on whose beckoning 
everything depended. 

What and what my heart has suffered in this first and 
second year, and how great my not fictitious humility and 
almost despair has been, ah! how little do those know, 
who afterwards most confidently try to attack the 
wounded majesty of the pope. And although they had not 
made these verses (to use Virgil's words), they 
nevertheless carried off the honor, which I, however, 
gladly granted them. 

But |, while those people were spectators and left me 
alone in danger, was not so joyful, confident and certain, 
for | did not know many things that | know now. Yes, | 
knew nothing at all about indulgences, what they were, 
just as the whole papacy itself knew nothing about them; 
they were held in honor only because of custom and 
habit. Therefore, | did not dispute in order to dismiss it, 
but since | knew very well what it was not, | desired to 
know what it was. And since the dead or dumb teachers, 
that is, the books of theologians and lawyers, were not 
enough for me, | decided to consult the living ones and 
to listen to the Church of God itself, so that, if there were 
any instruments of the Holy Spirit left anywhere, they 
would have mercy on me and, for the general benefit, 
also make me certain of the indulgence. 





Now many good men raised my theses high, but it 
was impossible that | could have acknowledged them as 
the Church and instruments of the Holy Spirit. | looked 
up to the pope, the cardinals, the bishops, the 
theologians, the jurists, the monks, and expected the 
spirit from them. For | had eaten and drunk myself so full 
of their teaching that | did not feel whether | was asleep 
or awake. And having overcome all grounds of proof by 
the Scriptures, | at last, by Christ's grace, with the 
greatest difficulty and anxiety, scarcely got over this one 
thing, that the church must be heard. For much more 
stubbornly and reverently (for | truly did it from the heart) 
| considered the church of the pope to be the right church 
than these shameful parasites do, who nowadays extol 
the church of the pope against me. If | had despised the 
pope as much as his praisers despise him now, | would 
have thought that at the same hour the earth would have 
to swallow me up like Korah and his people. 

But to come back to the point: since | was now waiting 
for the judgment of the church and the Holy Spirit, | was 
immediately ordered to be silent, and one invokes 
custom. Since | was frightened by the prestige of the 
name of the church, | gave in and offered to be silent 
against Cardinal Cajetan at Augsburg, humbly asking 
that he also impose silence on the clamor of the other 
party. But he not only refused, but added: if | did not 
recant, he would condemn me and everything that | had 
always taught would be mine. | 


The preface to this disputation is already in the 14th part. The Altenburg edition also gave Seckendorf the impression that our preface was 
written for a second edition of the theses just mentioned, which he stated in Ulst. I4utti., lib. |, p. 38, 866t. 13, § 28, likewise in the Incksx III 
suk anno 1517 (2). Walch now corrects his error in the preface to the 18th volume, p. 35, regarding the affiliation of our preface to the 95 
theses on indulgences, by saying: "that it extends further", also the wrong year 1516: "since the Disputation against indulgences only came 
out in 1517", but maintains that our preface in the German parts "stands among the books of 1516". He arrived at this erroneous assertion 
through this (as it seems) correct conclusion: What precedes ,,Xnnu8 Okri8t11517" must in any case belong to the year 1516. Now, however, 
our preface in the Jena edition stands before these words, i.e. 2c. But the matter is different. The first volume of the Jena edition actually 
begins with the words: 

Everything that precedes is actually only an introduction and preface to the following writings of Luther, which begin with the year 1517. There 
are none from the year 1516. This could have been recognized, which Walch overlooked, from the first marginal note in the first part of Jena, 
p. 1: "These four writings, which follow one after the other, although all written after the beginning of these things, are nevertheless because 
[they are] almost the same. 1: "These four writings, which follow one after the other here, although all written after the beginning of these 
things, are nevertheless placed together at the beginning because [they are] almost one and the same: How one should direct oneself in the 
books of M. L.". The old translation is very extensive, therefore we have translated it anew.

But | had already taught the Catechism with not a little 
fruit, of which | knew that it did not have to be 
condemned and that | would not have to suffer this if 
| did not want to deny Christ. Thus it came to this 
necessity that | was forced to try and expect the 
utmost. 

But | did not want to tell my story now, but to 
confess my foolishness, ignorance and weakness, so 
that no one (to follow Paul) thinks more highly of me 
than he sees in me, and does not doubt that | was and 
still am a human being in so great an offense, if 
anyone could doubt it; At the same time, so that by 
my example | might frighten the foolish, inexperienced 
(hopeful, | would say), wretched writers who have not 
come to know the cross and Satan, to whom it is 
nothing to overcome the pope, yes, the devil himself. 
Luther must be attacked, if he is overcome, then 
Satan is a mockery to them. 

What should | do? How could |, even if | were an 
angel, advise that behind my back such enemies 
would rise up under my name? But what do | complain 
to Thor about this, since no worse enemies of Christ 
and God have been than those who have persecuted 
Christ and God under the name of Christ and God! 
Read the Scriptures and you will see what happened 
to the prophets, the apostles and all the saints. True , 
is the word of Micah, yes, Christ's word [Micah 7, 6. 
Matth. 10, 36.]. "A man's enemies shall be his own 
household." Christ would never have been crucified if 
he had not nourished the worst devil, Judas, among 
the apostles and raised him high. 


But still I confess to you, dear brother, 





455 


this weakness and foolishness of mine, that thou also 
mayest learn to be of a humble mind, and know 
assuredly and truly that Satan is not dead, but that 
he is still a prince, not of one man, nor of one country, 
but of the whole world, to whose power, cunning, and 
malice every man is subject, except Christ alone, and 
those who in truth belong to Christ. 

Therefore it does not take place that we are safe 
and act hopefully and admire ourselves in the glory 
of the excellent gifts that we have before other 
people. You see here, if | may at least boast, from 
how great weakness the Lord has brought me to 
strength, from how great ignorance to knowledge, 
from how great trembling to fearlessness, certainly 
not without heavy struggles and temptations, as 
these foolish, bold, wretched writers presume. 
Nevertheless, | have not yet come to where they, as 
they make themselves believe, have already come. 
For although | do not fear the pope and his majesty 
now, | am still forced to fear the god of the pope, 
almost more than in the beginning. 

Summa, we are nothing, Christ alone is 
everything. If he turns away his face, we perish and 
Satan triumphs, even if we were holy people like 
Peter and Paul. Therefore, let us humble our souls 
under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt us 
in His time. For God resists the proud, but gives 
grace to the humble [1 Pet 5:5 ff]. As a fearful spirit 
is a sacrifice before God [Ps. 51, 19], so a stiff- 
necked and secure spirit is undoubtedly a sacrifice of 
the devil. Fare well in the Lord, and if it is necessary 
for you, improve yourself by my work and examples.

For the sake of Christ, | ask all those who want to

God go forth so industriously and clumsily that we 
have only mockery and abomination in it. | had hoped 
that one should henceforth give oneself to the holy 
Scriptures and let my books go, now that they have

books. What

Melanchthon’s preface to the second part of Luther's Latin writings, **) 


1546. 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


Philip Melanchthon gives his greeting to the godly 
reader. 
The venerable Lord Martin Luther had given us the 
hope that he would tell us his life story and the 
reason for his struggles in the preface to this part of 
his works. He would have done so, if the author had 
not been called away from this mortal life to eternal 
life with God and to the fellowship of the heavenly 
church before the printers had finished this volume. 
However, it would also be useful to have a detailed 
written consideration of his private life, for it was full 
of exemplary 





peln, which would serve to fortify godliness in pious 
hearts. Also a narration of the occasions would be 
useful, since it could instruct the descendants about 
many things. It would also refute the blasphemies of 
those who say that he was incited by princes or other 
people to undermine the dignity of the bishops, or 
that, inflamed by evil desire, he broke the bonds of 
monastic servitude. 

If he himself had explained and recalled this 
completely and abundantly, it would have been of 
use. For although Uebel-

*“The second volume of Luther's collected works, written in Latin, was published in Wittenberg by Johann Lasst in 1546. Because Luther, 


during whose lifetime this volume was still in progress, had died in the meantime, Melanchthon wrote our preface to it. We have included it 
because it is, in a sense, a "history of Luther's life," as it is called in a registry in Walch's old edition, Vol. XXI, 394*, No. XXXIV. It is found in

would have held up the usual adage to him: Every 
man speaks the best of himself, yet we know that he 
had such an honest mind that he would have told the 
story in the most faithful way. And there are still many 
good and wise men alive of whom he knew that the 
course of affairs was known to them, and it would 
have been ridiculous to invent another history, as it 
sometimes happens in poetry. But because the 
anniversary of his death occurred before the 
publication of this volume, we want to tell the truth 
about these very things, what we have partly heard 
from him, partly seen ourselves. 

It is an old and widely spread family of middle class 
people, who have the name Luther, in the area of the 
famous Grasen of Mansfeld. However, Martin Luther's 
parents had their residence first in the town of 
Eisleben, where Martin Luther was born. Then they 
moved to the city of Mansfeld, where his father, 
Johann Luther, also held official positions and was 
extremely dear to all good people because of his 
righteousness. 

His mother Margaretha, the wife of Johann Luther, 
had both the other virtues that befit an honorable 
woman, as well as especially chastity, godliness and 
diligent prayer, and other honorable women looked 
to her as a model of virtue. This woman 1) answered 
me several times on the question about the time 
when her son was born: she remembers the day and 
the hour exactly, but regarding the year she is 
doubtful. However, she said for certain that he was 
born on the tenth of November, at night after eleven 
o'clock, and the child was given the name Martin, 
because the next day, on which the child was 
incorporated into the Church of God through baptism, 
was dedicated to Martin. But his brother Jacob, an 
honorable and reliable man, said that the family's 
opinion about his brother's age was that he was born 
in 1483 AD. 

After he had reached the years in which he could 
be taught, the parents diligently encouraged their son 
Martin by instruction in the home to the knowledge 
and fear of God and to the practice of other virtues, 
and, as is the custom with respectable parents, saw 
to it that he learned to read and write, and it carried 
him, while he was still a small child, the

Lutherum about the time of the birth of his son, he answered me" 2c. 





Father of Georg Aemilius 2) to the school. Since he is 
still alive, he can testify to what is told here. 

At that time, however, the schools in which 
grammar was taught in the Saxon cities were only 
moderately respected, so Martin, when he had 
entered his fourteenth year, was sent to Magdeburg, 
together with Johann’ Reinecke. The _ latter 
subsequently became an excellent man, and by his 
virtue attained a great reputation in these lands. 
There was always a very great mutual love between 
these two, Luther and Reinecke, which had arisen 
either from a coincidence of their natures or from this 
communion of their studies as boys. But Luther did 
not stay longer than one year in Magdeburg. 

Then he heard in the school in Eisenach for four 
years a teacher who taught grammar more correctly 
and more skillfully than it was taught elsewhere 3). 
For I remember 4) that Luther praised the intellectual 
gifts of this man. But he was sent to this city because 
his mother had sprung from a respectable and old 
family in that region. Here he completed his 
grammatical studies, and since he had both an 
exceedingly sharp mind and was especially gifted in 
eloquence, he soon surpassed his peers, and easily 
surpassed the other young people who studied with 
him in choice of words and fluency of expression in 
speaking and writing, in unbound speech and in 
verse. 

Now that he had tasted the sweetness of the 
sciences, and was by nature burning with desire to 
learn, he bore a desire to go to high school as to the 
source of all learning. And such an excellent head 
could have mastered all sciences in turn, if he had 
found skillful teachers, and perhaps the gentle 
studies of true philosophy and the care taken in the 
formation of speech would have served to soften the 
vehemence of his nature. But at Erfurt he fell into the 
spiky dialectics of that time, which he quickly 
acquired because, due to the sharpness of his mind, 
he saw through the causes and sources of the rules 
better than others.

Since his studious mind demanded more and 
better things, he read most of the works of the old 
Latin writers: Cicero, Virgil, Livius and others. These 
he read, not as children are wont to take out mere 
words, but as a lesson or pictures of human life. 
Therefore, he looked more closely at the advice and 
sayings of these writers, and since he had a faithful 
and firm memory, most of what he had read and 
heard was present and before his eyes. Therefore, 
he excelled so much in his youth that the whole high 
school was amazed at Luther's intellectual gifts. 

Since he was adorned with the dignity of a master 
of philosophy when he was twenty years old, he 
began to study law on the advice of his relatives, who 
thought that such great gifts of intellect and 
eloquence should be brought to light and used for 
the common good. But shortly after, when he was 
twenty-one years old, he suddenly came to the 
monastery of the Augustinian monks in Erfurt 
without the knowledge and will of his parents and 
relatives and asked for admission. Since he was 
accepted, he not only learned the teachings of the 
church with the greatest diligence, but also imposed 
on himself the most rigorous discipline, and in all 
exercises with reading, disputing, fasting, praying, he 
was far ahead of everyone. However, he used to eat 
and drink very little by nature, which often amazed 
me, although he was neither small nor weak in body. 
I saw that for four days in a row, although he was 
quite well, he ate and drank absolutely nothing; 
otherwise I often saw that for many days he was 
content with a small loaf of bread and a herring every 
day. 

But it was the occasion for entering the monastic 
state, which he thought was the most suitable for 
godliness and the study of the teachings of God, that, 
1) as he himself told and many know: Often, when 
he was persistently thinking about the wrath of GOD 
or the extraordinary examples of punishment, he was 
suddenly struck with such great terror that he almost 
passed away. And I myself have seen, when in a 
disputation on the doctrine of effort, he was 
frightened, that he lay down on his bed in a nearby 
chamber, where he often repeated this saying and 
mixed it into his prayer: He has decided all under sin, 
so that he might 


1) It is to be erased in the original either here, or better still the 
preceding tuit, because it is too much. 





have mercy on all. He felt these terrors either first or 
most violently in that year, since he had lost a 
comrade who had been killed by I don't know what 
kind of accident. 

Therefore, it was not poverty but the striving for 
godliness that led him to the monastic life. Although 
he daily studied the doctrine in use in the schools and 
read the sententiarios, and in public disputations he 
clearly explained to the astonishment of many the 
aberrations that were inextricable for others, he 
treated these studies only as a secondary work, 
because he did not seek in this state the glory of a 
good head, but nourishment for godliness, and easily 
appropriated these scholastic doctrines. In the 
meantime, he eagerly read the sources of heavenly 
teaching, namely the prophetic and apostolic 
writings, in order to instruct his heart about the will 
of God and to nourish the fear of God and faith with 
solid testimonies. That he put more emphasis on this 
study was induced by the sufferings and terrors just 
mentioned. 

He also told that he had often been strengthened 
by the speeches of an old man in the Augustinian 
monastery in Erfurt. When he told him about his 
fright, he heard him talk a lot about faith and said 
that he had been pointed to the confession of the 
holy Christian faith, in which it says: I believe 
forgiveness of sins. He had interpreted this article in 
this way: one must not only generally believe that 
some sins are forgiven, just as the devils believe that 
they are forgiven to David or Peter, but it is God's 
command that we, each man for himself, believe that 
our sins are forgiven. And this interpretation, he said, 
was confirmed by a saying of Bernard, and he was 
shown the place in the sermon on the Annunciation 
where these words are written: But add this, that you 
also believe this, that through him your sins are 
forgiven you. This is the testimony that the Holy 
Spirit gives you in your heart: Your sins are forgiven 
you. For this is the apostle's opinion, that a man is 
justified by grace through faith. 

Luther said that he was not only strengthened by 
this word, but also made certain about the whole 
conception of Paul, who so often inculcates this 
saying: We are justified by faith. Since he had read 
the interpretations of many on this, he would have 
been convinced at that time, both by the speeches of 
this man and by 


462 


Prefaces by D. Martin Luther. W. xiv, sou-sn. 463 





the consolation of his heart, perceived that the 
interpretations 1) which existed at that time were null 
and void. Little by little, as he read and compared the 
sayings and examples told in the prophets and 
apostles, and awakened faith by daily invocation, he 
received more light. 

At that time he also began to read the books of 
Augustine, where in the interpretation of the Psalms 
and in the book "Of the Spirit and the Letter" he 
found many clear sayings that confirmed this doctrine 
of faith and the consolation that was kindled in his 
heart. But he did not yet leave the writers of 
sentences completely. He could recite the Gabriel and 
Cameracensis almost word for word by heart. Long 
and much he read the writings of Occam, whose 
acumen he preferred to that of Thomas and Scotus. 
He also diligently read Gerson. But all the works of 
Augustine he had often read and very well imprinted 
in his memory. 

He began this very diligent study in Erfurt, where 
he stayed in the Augustinian monastery for four 
years. 

But because at that time the venerable Lord 
Staupitz, who had helped to found the high school in 
Wittenberg, wished to promote theological studies in 
the newly established high school, he transferred 
Luther to Wittenberg in 1508, since he was now in 
his twenty-sixth year. Here, under the daily exercises 
in school and in sermons, his high gifts began to 
shine out even more. And as wise people, Doctor 
Martin Mellerstadt and others heard him, Mellerstadt 
often said that this man had such high spiritual gifts 
that he had a clear idea that he would change the 
usual way of teaching, which was the only way in 
schools at that time. 

Here he first read the dialectics and physics of 
Aristotle, but in the meantime he did not stop his 
studies to read the theological writings. After three 
years he left for Rome because of disputes among 
the monks. When he returned in the same year, he 
was decorated with the doctorate according to the 
common custom of the schools, as they say, for 
which the Duke of Saxony, Elector Frederick, paid the 
costs. For he had heard him preach, and both the 
spiritual gifts and the power of speech, as well as the 
excellence of the things 


1) Instead of interpretatlonem will read Interpretationes. 





The sermons were written by Luther and admired by 
the audience. And in order to see that, so to speak, 
the doctorate was attached to him in a mature mind, 
one must know that Luther was in his thirtieth year 
in that year. He himself told that when he very much 
fled from it and refused, he was ordered by Staupitz 
that he should allow himself to be adorned with this 
dignity. He jokingly said that God would now have 
much to do in his church, in which he would use his 
ministry. Although this word was spoken in jest at 
that time, it nevertheless came true, as many 
foreshadowing meanings precede changes. 

Then he began to interpret the Epistle to the 
Romans, then the Psalms. He illuminated these 
writings in such a way that, according to the 
judgment of all godly and intelligent people, a new 
light of doctrine seemed to go out after a long and 
dark night. Here he showed the difference between 
the Law and the Gospel; here he refuted the error 
that prevailed in the schools and sermons at that 
time, which taught that men deserve forgiveness of 
sins by their own works, and that men are righteous 
before God by outward piety (disciplina), as the 
Pharisees taught. Therefore, Luther called the hearts 
of men back to the Son of God and, like the Baptist, 
showed the Lamb of God who bears our sins; he 
showed that sins are forgiven by grace for the sake 
of the Son of God, and that, of course, this benefit 
must be received by faith. He also enlightened the 
other parts of the church doctrine. 

This beginning in very good things gave him great 
prestige, especially since the life of the teacher 
coincided with his speech, and it was seen that the 
speech was not only in the mouth, but in the heart. 
This admiration of his life brought him great affection 
in the hearts of the listeners, as the ancients also 
said: An honorable walk, as they say, finds the most 
faith everywhere. That is why later, when he 
changed some of the current customs, respectable 
men who knew him did not oppose him vehemently 
and, because of the reputation he had previously 
acquired through clear exposition of the right 
doctrine and holy life, agreed with him in the opinions 
by which, as they saw to their great sorrow, the 
whole world was divided. 

But at that time Luther did not change anything in 
the customs, rather he was a strict guardian of the 


464

465 





discipline among his own. Neither did he mix in 
anything of offensive opinions, but only made the 
common and absolutely necessary doctrine ever 
clearer, namely of repentance, of the forgiveness of 
sins, of faith, of the right consolation in the cross. By 
the sweetness of this doctrine all godly people were 
greatly delighted, and the scholars were pleased that 
Christ, the prophets and the apostles were, as it 
were, led out of darkness, out of prison and mud; 
that it could be recognized what difference there was 
between law and gospel, between the promises of 
the law and the promise of the gospel, between 
philosophy and gospel - which, of course, was not 
present in Thomas, Scotus and the like of them - 
between spiritual righteousness and righteousness in 
worldly things. 

In addition, Erasmus' writings had already directed 
the efforts of the youth to the learning of the Latin 
and Greek languages. Therefore, many who had a 
good and refined mind, now that they had been 
shown a more lovely way of teaching, began to 
detest the barbaric and sophistical teaching of the 
monks. 

Luther himself also began to study the Greek and 

Hebrew languages, so that he could judge all the 
more correctly through knowledge of the peculiar 
manner of speech and expression, and by drawing 
the doctrine from the source. 
While Luther was busy with this, letters of indulgence 
were offered for sale in these lands by the Dominican 
Tetzel, a very impudent swindler. Luther, who was 
burning with zeal for godliness, was enraged by his 
ungodly and shameful sermons, and he published the 
Theses on Indulgences, which are in the first volume 
of his [Latin] works. And these he publicly posted on 
the church adjoining the castle at Wittenberg on the 
day before the Feast of All Saints in 1517. Here Tetzel 
did not leave his kind, and, since he even hoped to 
earn thanks from the Roman Pontiff, called together 
his council, some monks and theologians who 
understood something of their sophistry, even if only 
a little, and ordered them to write something against 
Luther. In the meantime, he himself, in order not to 
be inactive, no longer hurls sermons but banishing 
rays against Luther, shouts everywhere that this 
heretic must be burned with fire, also publicly throws 
Luther's theses and the sermon on indulgences into 
the fire. Through this raging of Tetzel and his 
accomplices, Luther was 


The new law will make it necessary to act more 
broadly on these matters and to protect the truth. 

These were the beginnings of this dispute, in 
which Luther, who did not yet suspect or dream of a 
future change of customs, did not even completely 
reject indulgences, but only demanded moderation. 
Therefore those falsely accuse him who say that he 
began with an apparent cause in order to change the 
regime afterwards and to gain power either for 
himself or for others. And so much is missing that he 
should have been instigated or incited by the people 
at court, as the Duke of Brunswick wrote, that rather 
Duke Frederick even regretted that strife would be 
aroused, foreseeing far ahead that, although the 
beginning was for a good cause, nevertheless this 
flame would spread further, as is said about strife in 
Homer: A small quarrel immediately rises to heaven 
by the first impulse. And since Frederick, above all 
the princes of our time, loved public tranquility to the 
highest degree, was not at all greedy, and used to 
direct his advice above all things to the common good 
of the whole world, as can be seen from many things, 
he neither instigated Luther nor applauded him, and 
often made known his grievance, which he constantly 
harbored, fearing greater discord. 

But as a wise man, who not only followed worldly 
prudence, which commands to suppress the tender 
beginnings of all changes as quickly as possible, but 
also consulted the divine guide, which commands to 
hear the gospel and forbids to go against the known 
truth, and calls the obstinacy, which goes against the 
truth, a blasphemy terribly condemned by God, he 
did what many other godly and wise people have 
done: he gave way to God, he diligently read what 
was written and would not dampen what he believed 
to be the truth. 

I also know that he has investigated the judgment 
of learned and wise people about the matters 
themselves, and that at the Imperial Diet, which 
Emperor Carl V held in the city of Cologne after his 
coronation, he kindly asked Erasmus of Rotterdam to 
tell him freely whether he thought that Luther was 
mistaken in these matters of dispute, of which he had 
primarily dealt. Then Erasmus said straight out that 
Luther was right, but that he missed the Lindigkeit in 
him. Duke Frederick wrote to Luther about this in all 
seriousness and admonished him that he should 
moderate the sharpness of his writing.

It is also known that Luther would have promised 
Cardinal Cajetan to be silent, if silence would be 
imposed on his opponents. From this it can be clearly 
seen that at least at that time he had not yet decided 
to continue other fights, but that he desired silence, 
but that he was gradually pushed to other subjects, 
since unlearned writers attacked him from all sides. 

Hence followed the disputations of the difference 
of divine and human laws, of the shameful 
desecration of the Holy Communion by selling it and 
giving it to others. Here the whole doctrine of 
sacrifice had to be expounded and the right use of 
the sacraments shown. And when godly people in the 
monasteries heard that it was necessary to flee 
idolatry, they chanted to go away from godless 
bondage. 

So Luther added to the explanation of the doctrine 
of repentance, forgiveness of sins, faith, indulgences, 
then also these subjects: the difference of divine and 
human laws and the doctrine of the use of Holy 
Communion and the other sacraments, and of vows. 
And these were the main objects of dispute. The 
question of the power of the Roman bishop brought 
Eck on the track for no other reason than that he 
inflamed the hatred of the pope and the kings against 
Luther. 

But the Apostolic, Nicene and Athanasian Creeds 
he kept completely pure. Then, in many writings, he 
explains in great detail what should be changed in 
the customs and human statutes and why. And what 
he wanted to be kept and which form of doctrine and 
administration of the sacraments he approved of is 
evident from the confession which the Duke of 
Saxony, Elector John, and Prince Philip, Landgrave of 
Hesse 2c., presented to Emperor Carl V at the 
Imperial Diet in Augsburg in 1530. The same is also 
clear from the customs of the church in this city and 
from the doctrine which our church leads, the summa 
of which is clearly comprehended in this confession. 
I am telling this for the sake of the godly, so that they 
will not only see which errors Luther has punished, 
which idolatry he has abandoned, but also so that 
they will know that he has presented the entire 
doctrine necessary for the church and has restored 
purity in the ceremonies, and has given the godly an 
example of how to arrange the churches. 


should. And it is useful that the descendants know 
what Luther approved of. 

At this point I do not want to mention who are the 
ones who first distributed Holy Communion in both 
forms, who first had the private masses, where the 
monasteries were first abandoned. For Luther had 
done little about these things before the Imperial 
Diet, which took place in the city of Worms in 1521. 
He himself did not change the customs, but in his 
absence Carlstadt and others changed the customs. 
And since Carlstadt had done some things too hastily, 
Luther returned, and about what he approved or did 
not approve, declared his opinion in clear 
testimonies, which he published. 

We know that the people who are in power in the 
world abhor all changes very much, and one must 
admit that in this sad confusion of human life, even 
if discord is stirred up because of the most just 
causes, there is always something evil mixed in. 
Nevertheless, it is necessary in the church that the 
commandment of God be preferred to all human 
things. The eternal Father has spoken this word of 
his Son: "This is my beloved Son, him you shall hear." 
And he threatens blasphemers with eternal wrath, 
that is, those who seek to destroy the truth they have 
recognized. Therefore, it was Luther's godly and 
necessary duty, especially since he had the teaching 
office in the Church of God, to punish the pernicious 
errors that epicurean people even accumulated with 
an outrageous impudence, and the listeners had to 
agree with him, since he taught right. But even if a 
change is detestable, if there are many 
disadvantages in the discord, as we see with great 
regret that there are many of them, those are to 
blame who spread the errors in the beginning, and 
also those who now protect them with diabolical 
hatred. 

I mention this not only to defend Luther and his 
followers, but also so that godly hearts at this time 
and among the descendants may consider how the 
government of the true church of God is and has 
always been, how God, through the voice of the 
Gospel, is selecting an eternal church from this sinful 
mass, that is, from the great gathering of people, 
among whom the Gospel shines like a spark in the 
darkness. How, however, in the time of the 
Pharisees, Zacharias, Elizabeth, Mary and many 
others were the guardians of the right doctrine, 


468 


Even before our times, there were many who called 
upon God in the right way, in that some held more 
and others less clearly to the teachings of the Gospel. 
Such was also the old man of whom I have spoken, 
who often helped Luther in his struggle with terror 
and was to some extent a guide to the doctrine of 
faith. So we too should implore in fervent prayer that 
God may henceforth preserve the light of the Gospel 
in many, as Isaiah prays for his hearers [Cap. 8, 16]: 
"Seal the law to my disciples." Next, what I have 
mentioned shows that the made-up superstition does 
not endure, but is eradicated by God. Since this is the 
cause of the changes, it must be prevented that no 
errors are taught in the church. 

But I return to Luther. Just as he got involved in 
this matter at the beginning without seeking his own 
benefit, so too, although he was by nature hot- 
tempered and inclined to anger, he was nevertheless 
always mindful of his office, and fought only by 
teaching, and forbade to take up arms, and wisely 
distinguished between the offices of a bishop, who 
instructs the church of God, and that of the 
authorities, who keep the crowd in check with the 
sword in certain places. 

Therefore, since several times the devil (who 
strives to destroy the church by arousing aversions 
and to heap shame on God, and, as he is a 
mischievous fellow, takes pleasure in the errors and 
the ruin of wretched people) had inflamed agitated 
heads to this end, He has not only made the dignity 
and all the fetters of the worldly order glorious, but 
has also strengthened it. But when I consider how 
many great men in the church have often been in 
error in this matter, I fully believe that his heart was 
governed not only by human diligence but also by 
divine enlightenment, that he remained so 
consistently within the limits of his office. 

He therefore cursed not only the rebellious 
teachers of our time, the Muenzer and the 
Anabaptists, but also the bishops of the city of Rome, 
who most brazenly and impudently claimed by the 
decrees they issued that Peter was not only 
commanded to the office of teaching the gospel, but 
that the temporal rulers were also handed over to 
him. 

Yes, he exhorted all to give to God what is God's, 
and to the emperor what is the emperor's.

Emperor, that is, that they should serve God in good 
conscience through true repentance, through 
knowledge and spreading of the right doctrine, 
through right prayer and through the fulfillment of 
duty. However, each one should be reverently 
obedient to his worldly regime in all civil duties for 
the sake of God. And so Luther at least held himself: 
he gave to God what is God's, he taught rightly, he 
called upon God rightly; he also had the other virtues 
that are necessary for a man who pleases God. 
Furthermore, in worldly matters, he avoided all 
rebellious advice in the most constant way. I think 
that these virtues are such a great adornment that 
one could not wish for others that would be higher in 
this life. 

And although the virtue of this man himself is also 
worthy of praise, who used the gifts of God with 
reverence, one must give thanks to God primarily for 
having restored the light of the Gospel to us through 
him, and his teaching must be kept in memory and 
spread. And I do not turn to the cries of the 
epicureans or hypocrites, who either ridicule or 
condemn the revealed truth, but in fact firmly hold 
that the unanimous teaching of the whole general 
church of God is precisely this word of doctrine, 
which resounds in our churches, and that according 
to the knowledge of this doctrine the calling and the 
life must necessarily be directed; yes, that this is 
precisely the doctrine of which the Son of God says 
[Jn. 14:23], "He that loveth me shall keep my word, 
and my Father shall love him, and we will come unto 
him, and make our abode with him." For I speak of 
the summa of doctrine as it is understood and 
expounded in our churches by godly and learned 
men. For though some may explain things more and 
others less appropriately and adequately at times, or 
one may at times speak more unadorned than the 
other, there is nevertheless unanimity among the 
godly and learned in the main points of the matter. 

And since I think much and often of the doctrine 
at all times, it seems to me that from the time of the 
apostles, after the first purity, four significant 
changes in the doctrine followed. The age of Origen, 
although there were some who held to the right 
doctrine, among whom, I believe, was Methodius, 
who rejected the nonsensical teachings of Origen, 
nevertheless twisted the gospel into worldly wisdom 
in the hearts of the great multitude, i.e., he 


470

471 





They were taught this evil delusion of reason, that an 
outward discipline deserves forgiveness of sins, and 
that it is the righteousness of which it is said: The 
righteous shall live by faith. This age lost almost all 
the distinction of the Law and the Gospel, and lost 
the apostolic way of speaking, because it did not hold 
the proper meaning of the words "letter, spirit, 
righteousness, faith". And if the real meaning of the 
words is lost, which are the designations for things, 
then other things must necessarily be invented. From 
this seed sprouted the error of Pelagius, which has 
spread far and wide. Therefore Origen, although the 
apostles had given the church the pure doctrine or 
clear and wholesome sources, mixed in much filth. 

In order that the errors of this age might be at 
least partially removed, God awakened Augustine. He 
has purified the sources to some extent, and I have 
no doubt that if he were judge of the disputes of our 
time, we would have him completely on our side; at 
least in forgiveness by grace in vain, in righteousness 
by faith, in the use of the sacraments, in the middle 
things, he keeps it clear with us. Although in some 
places he states more clearly, in others less clearly or 
actually what he wants, the reader will recognize, if 
he reads his writings with honesty and the ability to 
judge, that he is with us. For the fact that our 
opponents sometimes cite individual sayings torn out 
of his writings against us, and refer to the fathers 
with great clamor, they do not do this out of love for 
the truth and out of attachment to antiquity, but in a 
flattering way they use the reputation of the ancients 
for the present idols, to whom these idols of the last 
time were still unknown. 

But it is evident that nevertheless the seed of 
superstition was present in the time of the fathers. 
That is why Augustine also wrote a number of things 
about vows, although he speaks of them in a less 
offensive way than others. But the infirmities of their 
time always attach something of their inconsistency 
even to good people, because we love, as we love 
the fatherland, so we love the existing customs in 
which we are raised, and the word of Euripides is very 
true: XXX XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXX [All that is customary is 
sweet’. Ah, that God would grant that all who boast 
that they follow Augustine would take into account 
the constant opinion and, that I say so, the heart of 
Augustine, and not merely deceive him. 





melte sayings falsely twisted to their opinions. 

And the restored light has been useful to the 
descendants through the writings of Augustine. For 
after that Prosper, Maximus, Hugo and some of their 
equals, who were leading in scholarship, almost 
followed the guidance of Augustine, until the time of 
Bernard. But since in the meantime the rule and the 
wealth of the bishops had grown, the age of the 
giants followed. Disreputable and unlearned people 
ruled in the church, some of whom had only learned 
something from the arts of the Roman court or from 
the judiciary. 

Therefore the Dominicans and Franciscans arose; 
seeing the debauchery and the works of the bishops 
and abhorring their wicked ways, they began a very 
moderate life and shut themselves up, as it were, in 
a prison of discipline. But at first the ignorance of 
superstition made more. Afterwards, when they saw 
that the study of people in high schools was directed 
only to jurisprudence, because in Rome many had 
already attained great prestige and wealth through 
the affairs of strife, they sought to bring people back 
to the study of theology. But they lacked the right 
insight. Albertus and similar people, who were 
devoted to the teachings of Aristotle, began to 
transform the teachings of the church into 
philosophy. And this fourth age has poured into the 
evangelical sources not only filth, but poison on top 
of it, that is, opinions that approved of obvious 
idolatries. There are so many aberrations and false 
opinions in Thomas, Scotus and similar teachers that 
more sensible theologians have always asked for 
another kind of teaching, which would be simpler and 
purer. 

And it cannot be said without a tremendous 
insolence that a change of this doctrine would not 
have been necessary, since it is well known that a 
large part of the sophisms in these disputations is not 
understood even by those who have grown old in this 
kind of teaching. Then, obviously, idolatries are 
confirmed, since they teach that the sacrifice [of the 
mass] is given to the one who only performs the 
outward work, since they excuse the invocation of 
images, since they deny that sins are forgiven by 
grace through faith, since they make human 
ceremonies a torture for the conscience, yes, there 
are many other abominable and blasphemous things 
which, when I think of them, make me shudder all 
over. 

Therefore, we want GOtte, the eternal father

473 





of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, through the ministry of 
Martin Luther, has once again had the filth and poison 
thrown out of the evangelical sources, and has 
restored the pure doctrine to the Church. When we 
commemorate this, it is fitting that all the godly on 
earth unite their prayers and sighs, and ask with a 
fervent heart that God may confirm what he has 
worked in us, for the sake of his holy temple: Living 
and true GOD, eternal Father of our Lord JEsu Christ, 
you Creator of all things and of the Church, yours is 
this word and promise: For my name's sake I will have 
mercy on you; for my sake, yes, for my sake I will do 
it, so that I will not be blasphemed. I beseech thee 
with all my heart, that for thy glory, and for thy Son's 
sake, thou wilt always gather unto thee an everlasting 
church, even among us, by the voice of thy gospel; 
and for thy Son's sake, our Lord Jesus Christ, who was 
crucified for us, and was raised again, who is our 
Mediator and Advocate, rule our hearts by the Holy 
Ghost, that we may call upon thee aright, and serve 
thee according to thy good pleasure. 

Govern also the educational institutions and guide 

and maintain these communities and their discipline, 
which are the shelters of your church and studies. 
Since you have created the human race for the sake 
of being known and called by men, for which reason 
you have revealed yourself with glorious testimonies, 
do not let these multitudes be destroyed among 
whom your teaching resounds. And since your Son, 
our Lord Jesus Christ, when he was about to enter his 
death throes, prayed for us: Father, sanctify them in 
the truth; thy word is truth, we add our prayer to the 
prayer of our high priest, and at the same time pray 
with him that thy doctrine may always shine among 
the human race and guide us. We have heard that 
Luther also prayed this daily, and under such prayer 
his soul gently departed from the mortal body, now 
that he was in his sixty-third year. 
Posterity has many monuments of his erudition and 
godliness. He published doctrinal writings in which he 
understood the salutary and necessary doctrine of| 
man, which instructs the devout heart about 
repentance, faith and the right fruits of faith, about 
the use of the sacraments, about the difference 
between the law and the gospel, about the difference} 
between the gospel and worldly wisdom, about the 
dignity of the worldly state, about the dignity of the 
worldly state, and about the dignity of the worldly 
state. 





Finally, he wrote about the most important articles of 
doctrine that must be present in the church. Then he 
added controversial writings in which he refuted 
many errors that are harmful to people. He also 
published exegetical writings, that is, many 
interpretations of the prophetic and apostolic 
writings. Even the enemies confess that in this kind 
of writings he surpasses the interpretations of all that 
exist. 

All godly hearts recognize that these are great 
merits. But truly in usefulness and effort these works 
are equal to the translation of the Old and New 
Testaments, in which there is such clarity that the 
German text alone can serve instead of a 
commentary. However, it is not bare, but has very 
learned annotations added to it, 1) and the tables of 
contents on the individual parts, which both indicate 
the summa of the heavenly doctrine and inform the 
reader about the nature of the speech, so that devout 
hearts can take solid testimonies of the doctrine from 
the sources themselves. For Luther did not want to 
keep hearts fixed on his writings, but to lead the 
hearts of all to the sources themselves. He wanted us 
to hear the voice of God Himself, he wanted true faith 
and prayer to be kindled in many, so that God would 
be praised rightly and many would become heirs of 
eternal life. 

This will and these great works must be praised 
with a grateful heart and remembered as an 
example, so that we, each according to his measure, 
also strive to adorn the church. For it is to these two 
ends that the whole life and all endeavors and 
attempts in life are primarily to be directed: first, that 
we glorify God's glory; second, that we benefit the 
church. Of the first of these Paul says [1 Cor. 10:31], 
"Do everything for the glory of God"; of the other, 
the 122nd Psalm, v. 6 [Vulg.], "Ask for that which is 
for the peace of Jerusalem," and there is added in 
the same verse the exceedingly sweet promise that 
those who love the Church will be happy and blessed. 
These heavenly commandments and these promises 
should cause all to learn the doctrine of the church 
rightly, to love the ministers of the gospel and the 
wholesome teachers, and to devote diligence and 
effort to spreading the right doctrine and maintaining 
the harmony of the true church. Farewell, dear 
reader. Wittenberg, June 1, 1546.

Prefaces by D. Martin Luther. W. xiv, 665-667. 


475 


The first volume of the Jena German edition of Luther's works was 
prefaced by Nicolaus von Amsdorf, *) 


February 18, 1555. 


To the Sublime, Highborn Princes and Lords, Mr. 
John Frederick the Mediator, Mr. John William, 
and Mr. John Frederick the Younger, brothers, 
Dukes of Saxony, Landgraves in Thuringia, and 
Margraves of Meissen, my gracious Princes and 
Lords, also to all pious Christians and saints on 
earth. 


1. by the grace, strength and power of God 
through the Holy Spirit, in the knowledge of our dear 
Lord Jesus Christ and His Antichrist, that you may 
grow and increase in this daily, to the praise and glory 
of God, and to the comfort and salvation of His holy 
Church. 

Gracious Princes and Lords (also dear friends and 
brothers in Christ)! After E. F. G. dear Lord and 
Father, the Elector of Saxony, most blessed and noble 
memory, my most gracious Lord, some years ago 
ordered the writings and books of Doct. Martin 
Luther's writings and books and to bring them into 
print, everyone was in good hope that it would gain 
its progress, that such a treasure, for the good and 
comfort of his dear Christianity, should be brought 
forth, as then for a good beginning two Tomi, also of 
Doctor Luther's life, have been produced. 

But after his death, when the time of spiritual and 
bodily tribulations began, into which we have fallen 
out of God's wrath and disgrace because of our sin, 
the game has turned; and although some Tomi at 
Wittenberg have gone out through the pressure, S. 
C. F. G. and ours had this concern: 

3. first, that some books of controversy are 
omitted, which are good, useful and necessary for the 
Church of Christ to know for the sake of history. 

4. secondly, many things in the same tomis have 
been omitted, silenced, or changed for the sake of 
glimpses. 





5 Third, other scholars' books are_ included, 
although we desire to have Luther's books alone. 
Luther's books alone we desire to have with one 
another, as the title of the Tomorum indicates and 
shows. 

6. fourth, the interpreted books are also included, 
which in many places did not meet or reach the spirit 
and mind of Doctor Luther. 

7) Fifth and last, in the printed tomes, the books 
of Doctor Martini are not gathered together according 
to the order of the time, as the man of God, Doct. 
Martin Luther, and want to defend this, because the 
man of God in the beginning of the things, since he 
was still a pious, strict monk and pope, and at the 
same time did not know otherwise, had written and 
left much popery. 

8 Such and similar defects and errors in the 
writings and books of D. Mar. have caused and 
moved the Reverend Prince, of blessed memory, 
after his execution, to consider ways in which the 
blessed man's books and writings could be printed 
and preserved elsewhere in his principality, for the 
Christian Church, for good, pure, unadulterated, 
without addition, whole and proper. 

(9) And has therefore required the worthy and 
well-respected servant of Christ, my dear Lord and 
brother in Christ, M. Georgium Rorarium (to whom 
Doctor Martinus, the dear man of God, had previously 
ordered his books to be printed), from Denmark for 
such work, and has set up the printing house at Jena, 
so that the said books may be printed all together, 
according to the order of the years, whole and 
unchanged (as the dear and worthy man had 
ordered). 


1) "the printing" - the printing press. In Latin: 
officinam typographicam. 





*) While each volume of the Wittenberg edition of Luther's works is preceded by a preface by a foreign hand, mostly by Melanchthon, 
the Jena edition of the complete works contains only this one preface, which was originally written for the first volume in German, but then 
also translated into Latin a tzuockum LvanZelli stuaio80 and added to the first volume of the Latin Jena parts. This Latin translation is taken 
up by the Erlanger in the opp. vur. urZ., torn |, r>. 3 Our preface is found in German in the Jenaer, vol. 1, after the title page; in the Altenburger, 
vol. |, p. 2; in the Leipziger, vol. XX, p. 194 and in Walch. We give the text according to the Jena edition.

The author of this book is the author of the first part 
of the book, the second part of the book, the third 
part of the book, the third part of the book, the third 
part of the book, and the fourth part of the book, the 
third part of the book. 

10. which work pleasing to God E. F. G. as the 
heirs, after their gracious, dear lord and father's 
blessed departure, are no less willing to promote by 
God's grace, as the confirmation of the given privilege 
sufficiently testifies. 

May God promote and continue with grace such a 
work He has begun in honor of His holy name, and let 
it run to a happy end; may He also always control and 
ward off the devil and his scales, who want to hinder 
this work. Which with me all pious Christians, who 
with grateful hearts recognize this great miraculous 
work, which God has shown to the world at this last 
sorrowful time through the great man of God Martin 
Luther, and has worked against the Pope, should and 
will desire and ask of God, (without doubt) also 
desire. 

12 In this first part of Doctor Martin's books and 
writings (which he wrote in the beginning of these 
matters, Anno 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and let go out) one 
will see and find the histories and history of how this 
matter of religion began and proceeded in order: 
what Doctor Luther caused to be written; how he got 
into this matter; how he progressed in it, and was led 
more and more into greater and more certain 
understanding and joy of the spirit. Also, how his 
adversaries pushed him and drove him into writing to 
investigate the truth (with their raving, raging, 
scolding and condemning). 

For this reason, for the sake of a_ better 
understanding of the whole matter, several Latin 
tracts have been translated into German, and several 
books by the opponents have been included for the 
sake of history, so that the German reader may 
receive in this first part a perfect account of 
everything that happened with v. Luther in the first 
years. Luther in the first years, and may recognize all 
the better how wonderfully God dealt with his last 
miraculous work, by which he wanted to reveal the 
Pabstacy and bring his holy Gospel to light again. In 
the other parts, however, the things themselves will 
be such that one must not mix in so many foreign, 
nor interpreted books and writings. Therefore, no one 
should search or wait for them, unless necessity 
demands it for the sake of history. 





14 However, in order that the Christian reader may 
also be warned against the clever ones who only draw 
antilogies and disgusting speeches from Luther's 
writings. Luther's writings, the Christian reader is also 
warned to read these books with distinction and care, 
so he should know that the books that Luther wrote 
in the beginning of these things, which are in this first 
part, do not look the same as the others that he wrote 
afterwards, nor do they agree. For in the beginning, 
as a right, pious pope, he gave much to the Roman 
Antichrist, which he subsequently changed in the 
following years, when he recognized such injustice 
through great struggle, tribulation and challenge. 

15 For he was a serious and strict monk who 
honored and feared the pope and the Roman See in 
all seriousness, for which reason he did not attack the 
pope or his teaching in the beginning, but only the 
gross abuses of the indulgence preachers (who under 
the name and appearance of the pope miserably 
seduced and deceived the poor people with their 
impudent sermons) to defend the pope's honor and 
power. 

(16) In this, as indicated above, he, as a pious, 
faithful and just pope, allowed many things to remain 
unpunished, which he afterwards, having come to a 
true knowledge of Christ and divine truth through the 
Word of God, justly and on the basis of Scripture 
rejected and condemned. For he did not attack the 
pope and his Roman court out of recklessness, 
presumptuousness, wantonness or sacrilege, but out 
of a right zeal of spirit and faith, yes, out of the 
greatest need of his conscience, driven and forced to 
do so by God's spirit and word. 

17 For his adversaries wanted to defend, handle 
and protect their and the Roman court's error, 
abuses, heresies and idolatry, without the foundation 
of Scripture, only with insults, blasphemies and 
condemnation, so that they only gave him cause to 
think about the matter further, and to examine the 
Scriptures better and more diligently and investigate 
whether he was mistaken or wrong, as they blamed 
him. For he was not comfortable with the matter at 
first, would have liked to remain silent, pause and be 
at peace, where his opponents would not have forced 
him to take responsibility. 

18) But the longer and more he searched the 
Scriptures, the more light and knowledge God gave 
him, the more he grew in faith, the stronger and 
firmer he became, so that in the end he found that 
his doctrine was firmly and unmovably founded in the 
Holy Scriptures, and that the cries and writings of the 
adversaries were an outrage and a sacrilege, so that 
from them he could denounce the pope and his 
followers.

Prefaces by D. Martin Luther. W. XIV. 670-673. 


479 





the whole regiment of the Roman court came to 
realize what a bigot and abomination of desolation 
he would be in Christendom. 

19 All this can be seen from the first books of D. 
Lutheri, how a right pious Papist became a right pious 
Christian, and a friend became an enemy of the 
papacy. Let no one be offended or annoyed by the 
fact that in these first books he teaches and writes a 
lot of pontifical things, such as the authority of the 
pope and the bishops, the mass, and one form of the 
holy and reverend sacrament, in a pontifical way, 
because at that time, as a strict, serious, God-fearing 
monk, he did not know or understand it better. 

(20) But after he was enlightened by the Word of 
God, came to his right understanding, and grew and 
increased by daily practice and experience, he wrote 
much differently, and put down all popery and 
brought it to the ground; as a diligent reader will find 
and learn from his books, if he only pays attention to 
the time and order when they went out. 

And although the dear holy man of God often 
wished and desired that his books should perish, and 
that everyone should be moved and driven to read 
the living fountain and well of the holy Scriptures (for 
which alone he wrote and did all things), yet we must 
look and pay more attention to what is useful and 
necessary for the Christian church than to his wish 
and will. 

22. For this I know for certain, that since the time 
of Saint Paul there has not come his equal on earth, 
who has explained and interpreted the holy 
Scriptures with such seriousness, spirit and 
understanding, and has refuted all errors, false 
teachings and heresies, especially the first and last, 
especially the first and last, also the worst and most 
harmful heresy that ever came on earth, that good 
works are necessary for salvation, has so powerfully 
refuted and overthrown by God's word, as this very 
our dear Doctor Martinus Lutherus, of holy memory. 

Neither has there ever come, nor will there ever 
come, anyone who has so clearly, gloriously, and 
surely established and confirmed the articles of our 
holy Christian faith and the two sacraments, which 
Christ, our dear Lord and Savior, instituted and 
commanded us to keep, by God's Word, and 
especially by the Lord's Supper against Zwingel and 
his followers, as he has. 

24 For this reason, the books of Doctoris Martini 
Lutheri will be useful and beneficial. 





I will let the readers experience for themselves. Thus 
the deed itself gives and shows it; as they say, the 
work praises its master. For before Doctor Luther's 
time, no one knew, not even the best and holiest 
monks themselves, how to get rid of sins, go to 
heaven, and become blessed. For this reason, each 
one sought and chose his own way, by which he 
wanted to attain God's grace, so that he would 
become blessed. One has become a monk, another a 
forest friar or hermit; one has run to Rome, another 
to St. James to obtain indulgences; some have 
founded monasteries and cathedral churches, 
masses and vigils, and all this has happened because 
they wanted to obtain God's grace, forgiveness of sin, 
eternal life and blessedness. 

25. But from Doctor Martin Luther, of blessed 
memory, we have now learned, praise God, much 
else, namely that such things are all in vain and 
useless, even vain deceit and lies, and that there is 
no more than one way and means to attain grace and 
salvation, namely faith in Jesus Christ, our dear Lord, 
through which alone, without all works, even those 
which God has commanded, we attain eternal 
salvation, as Christ our dear Lord Himself says: "I am 
the way, the truth, and the life." 

This way to heaven and eternal life has been 
shown and pointed out to us by the dear, precious 
man of God D. Mart. Luther has shown and pointed 
out to us in his writings that this path alone, and no 
other, neither above in heaven nor here on earth, can 
bring and lead us to heaven and eternal life; just as 
all the saints who have ever existed, are now, and 
will yet come, must be saved by this path alone, one 
and all. 

27 Secondly, we have not known otherwise that 
the Mass was the best, highest and most glorious 
service for serving, honoring, praising and thanking 
God. But now (thanks be to God in eternity) we have 
learned from Doctor Martins, and learn daily from his 
writings, and know for certain and for certain that the 
Papal Mass is the worst abomination and idolatry 
before God, invented and fabricated by men, so that 
one neither honors nor serves God, but only mocks, 
reviles and blasphemes, thereby provoking Him to 
anger, and to hasten and continue with His 
punishment, for which knowledge we can never 
sufficiently thank God. 

28 Thirdly, we have not known otherwise, that the 
pope was a vicar and governor of Christ, our dear 
Lord, whom we consider to be one of the most 
important men in the world. 


480 D. V. a. 1, 10-13. prefaces on collections of L.'s writings. W. XIV. 673-676. 


have feared, honored and celebrated God. Now, 
however, to God be glory, praise and thanks, we 
have learned, and everyone can still learn daily from 
these writings and books of D. M., that the Pope is 
nothing other than the right, true Antichrist, of which 
the Holy Scriptures testify and say, and especially St. 
Paul has proclaimed and prophesied this clearly and 
plainly, that he, like the old heretics, has forbidden 
marriage and food sub specie pietatis. 

(29) And we certainly consider and believe that 
the holy man of God, D. M. L., was specially 
awakened by God to reveal and disgrace the 
Antichrist in Rome, so that he would be overthrown 
by God's word and despised in all devout Christians' 
hearts. And for this great benefit of the revelation of 
the Antichrist, which we received from the holy, dear 
man of God D. Mart. Luther, we can never thank God 
enough. Otherwise we would have worshipped and 
honored the devil and his Antichrist all our lives, and 
would have been thrown into the lake of fire with 
him, as John says in his Revelation in chapter 20, v. 
10. 

30 And if we had no other use nor piety from D. 
M. Luther's holy memory books than these three 
pieces shown above. M. Luther's books of holy 
memory, except these three pieces mentioned 
above, we should nevertheless hold his books dear 
and valuable, and never let them leave our hands. 
Especially, however, that we may beware and guard 
against the Antichrist and his adiaphorists, who 
adorn the abomination of the idolatrous mass, and 
want to protect and defend under the appearance of 
a new discipline, and persuade us that under the 
appearance and name of God's word we should 
worship the Antichrist of Rome, the Babylonian 
whore, and the beast that carries her, and take his 
mark upon our hands and foreheads [Revelation 
16:2, 20:4]. 16, 2. 20, 4.] so that we may buy and 
sell, (that is,) not come into danger of body and 
goods. 

Now all articles of our Christian faith are so clearly 
explained in the books of D. Martini, of blessed 
memory, books, as also reported above, all articles 
of our Christian faith are so clearly and certainly 
explained, that even the gates of hell with all their 
scales and limbs can neither say nor raise anything 
against it; so irrefutably has he established, proven 
and proved them with God's word. And especially 
these three articles, that there are three persons in 
one divine being; item, that Jesus Christ is true God 
and man, and the doctrine of justification; to this 
may also be added the revelation of the Antichrist in 
Rome. 


481 


These articles of our holy Christian faith no doctor, 
since Christianity stood after the time of the apostles, 
has so clearly explained, proved, fortified and 
founded from the Scriptures as he, therefore his 
books are not to be paid for with all the world's goods 
and money. I will remain silent about the other 
articles of our holy Christian faith, which he has so 
brightly and clearly explained and declared, that we 
have thereby been delivered from the horrible and 
terrible darkness of the Babylonian prison of the 
Roman See, and have come into the light of freedom, 
of the eternal divine truth. For this, however, we can 
never thank God enough that He has awakened this 
man, His chosen armor, Doctorem Martinum, by 
special grace and given him to the German nation. 

For this reason, I have commanded these books of 
Doctor Martin Luther, the holy man and faithful 
servant of Jesus Christ, not to jureconsultis and 
rabulis forensibus, nor to demosthenibus and cice- 
ronibus, much less to stargazers, who! ) ex astris 
prophesy how people should fare, but to the pious 
and simple-minded Christians, to be read with 
seriousness, deliberation and diligence. 

For in these books of D. M. L. one finds the 
doctrine of the whole Christian religion, all articles 
and necessary pieces of our holy Christian faith, 
which are found together in no doctor, in no conciliar, 
nor in the whole of Christendom; but in the Drecket 
and Drecketalen of the Roman Antichrist, as D. 
Luther, my dear Lord and Father, has called it, only 
the contradiction, not one Christian word is to be 
seen nor found unadulterated. And if all Christian 
teachers in the whole world, who ever existed, were 
melted together into one heap, all articles and the 
whole doctrine of the Christian faith would not be 
found in it. 

35 For this reason, since the time of the apostle D. 
Martin Luther, the like of spirit and faith, wisdom and 
understanding of the truth, has not been in 
Christendom, nor will it come; which in time, when 
we old people, who are still alive, are gone, the world, 
where it is to stand differently for a longer time, will 
well find out and experience. 

36) So that such a precious, great and 
inexpressible treasure of the books of I). Luther's 
books may not be stolen from the Christian church, 
nor suppressed or lost, but may remain and be 
preserved together, nor be sullied by the addition of 
other books with human wisdom, nor be altered and 
changed.

483 





These books of D. Luther are completely pure and 
unadulterated, in which nothing has been omitted, 
nor has anything been added or mixed into them, 
but as the dear man of God himself wrote, read, or 
preached them, from word to word, for the sake of 
our descendants, they have been commanded to be 
printed. 

So that they may not only feel, see and recognize 
the spirit, wisdom and understanding of the holy 
man Luther, but also how he has grown and 
increased therein, and be able to distinguish him 
from other spirits (who have taught and preached 
Christ persuasibilibus humanae sapientiae verbis, to 
please men). For the word of Christ is a word of the 
cross and a source of annoyance, which offends and 
angers all the high-minded, worldly-wise and wise, 
who have always wanted to teach and preach Christ 
and his gospel better than Luther, the apostles, even 
Christ himself, whom they want to lead to school and 
establish a better discipline than he, and thus 
wisdom must be justified by its own children [Luc. 7, 
35]. 

38 For this reason St. Paul calls them "enemies of 
the cross of Christ" and animalia ventris, because 
they teach and preach the "cross of Christ". 





They are servants of the belly, who seek the peace 
of this world with the gospel, which is impossible, as 
Christ, our dear Lord, himself says [Matth. 10, 34. 
35.]: "I did not come to send peace, but the sword 
(that the Christians should suffer). For I am come to 
stir up a man against his father, and the daughter 
against her mother, and the cord against her sister- 
in-law" 2c. 

39 In sum, when and where the gospel is 
preached, there is always peace. For the world 
cannot suffer its own chosen and invented services 
and traditions to be punished and condemned by the 
gospel. For it always thinks more and higher of the 
pope than of Christ's word and commandment. 
Therefore, even today, it does not cease to rage and 
rage against God and His word and its preachers, 
until Christ, our dear Lord, puts an end to the game 
through His glorious, blessed future. Let this happen 
soon and quickly, so that we poor, miserable 
Christians may finally be saved and redeemed from 
the wicked, evil world and its prince, amen. February 
18, 1555.

*Already earlier, about 1525, Luther had prepared a chronological table about the Median-Persian kings for use in the interpretation of 
the minor prophets and had it printed, probably only for his audience. He says this himself in the preface to the interpretation of the prophet 
Haggai according to the Altenburg as well as the Zwickau Relation, and also in the interpretation of Zechariah the same table is mentioned again 
in the aforementioned manuscripts. This is not to be confused with our present writing (compare our first annotation on Haggai in this volume), 
which was only completed in 1540 and printed in 1541. After that, Luther published it again, several times changed, in 1545 (Késtlin, Mart. Luther 
[31, Vol. Il, 599). Originally, Luther had made this chronicon only for his own use, but had not thought of publishing it. However, his friends, 
whom he had allowed to see his work, asked him to omit it by printing it. Still on March 3, 1541, v. Justus Jonas had it "written out by a magistrum 
who presides over it", and sent the copy to Prince Joachim of Anhalt (Kolde, Analecta, p. 375), The original is in the royal library in Dresden. The 
Latin title is Supputatio annorum mundi. The Jena edition has given it the date 1541, but has placed it among the writings of 1545, with the 
marginal note that the first edition was done in 1541, and the improved edition went out in 1545. In Latin it is found in the Wittenberg edition 
(1558), tom. VII, toi. 555 and in the Jena (1570), tom. IV, toi. 673 b; German according to the translation made by Aurifaber in 1550 in the

the Chronikon is continued until the year 1559 and is preceded by a preface by Aurifaber. We omit this and other additions by Aurifaber, and 
translate anew according to the Wittenberg edition. The Jena edition is only a reprint of the same.

[Preface.] 
Martin Luther. 


This calculation of the years | had made only for 
my use, not that it should be a chronicle or history 
book, but that | should have it as it were a table before 
my eyes to look up the times and years of the 
histories that are told in the holy scriptures, if | wanted 
to remember how many years the patriarchs, judges, 
kings, princes had lived or reigned, or in how great a 
period they had followed one another. Therefore, 
there is no reason for me to either praise or belittle 
them with many words. For | have not had my eye on 
what use it would be to others or how much, 
especially since so many chronicles or histories exist 
and increase daily. | am satisfied with the benefit that 
| have obtained in the calculation. Those who wanted 
to have it published, since | gave them the 
opportunity to see it at their request, or those who will 
read it, may see that they will do something worth the 
effort if they read it. | really do not care whether it 
perishes or remains, but | also do not care much 
whether it does others a satisfaction or not. 

Of course, the Chronicon of Canon and Philip 1) is 
the first and a very good example of calculation, in 
which the whole course of the years is very beautifully 
divided into six millennia, in which | also followed. 
One thing | have been guilty of in the history of Joram, 
king of Judah, under Elijah and Elisha, in which | have 
counted twenty years more than all other chroniclers 
have. This shall be my fault or my diligence; in its 
place it shall be accounted for. For the chronicle of 
Eusebius, which is taken from the seventy 
interpreters, who in the first book of Moses Cap. 5 (as 
Jerome tells in the "Hebrew Questions") always 
translated two hundred instead of a hundred 
(perhaps because they took the singular Meath for 
the plural Meoth). 


1) Chronicon Charionis Philippicum. In 1532, the 
mathematician Carion published a chronicon to which Melanchthon 
had contributed significantly. 


(| am silent about the others), has brought into all 
chronicles before our time this error, that they have 
1249 years too much. Yes, they have exceeded the 
sixth millennium, which they call the sixth age, and 
count the just mentioned years in the seventh 
millennium, which they call the seventh age. 2) But 
about Eusebius is more wavy to complain, who was 
indeed, as Jerome writes, an admirable and very 
careful man; about all other historians we complain, 
and they themselves complain among themselves, 
that they had for the exact calculation of the years no 
all-stop. Therefore, | have set them aside, and in this 
work | want to take this calculation of the years mainly 
from the holy scriptures, on which we can and should 
base ourselves certainly and reliably. But the 
scripture has it in such a way, as follows: 


Sections for calculating the years from the creation of 
the world: 


1656 except for the Flood. Gen. 5. 

367 until the calling of Abraham. Gen. 11 and 12. 

430 except for the Exodus from Egypt. 
Ex 12, Gal 3. 

480 until the temple of Solomon. 1 Kings 6. 158 
until the end of Solomon's tribe. 2 Kings 11 and 2 
Chron. 23. 

291 to the path of the Yekhanyah. 
2 Kings 243 ) to the end. 
11 [the reign) of Zidekiah. 2 Kings 24. 70 years of 
the desolation of Jerusalem. 
2 Chron. 36. Ezra 1. 
46 until the beginning of the weeks in the second 
year of Darius. Joh. 2, 20. 
483 years or 69 weeks until the death and 
resurrection of Christ. Dan. 9. 
7 years of the last week, in which the covenant 
is strengthened and the law is fulfilled in the 
middle of the week. Dan. 9. 
The following years of Christ are clear in 
themselves. 
2) Luther assumed in 1540 that this was the year 5500 of the 


world, while those had already arrived at the year 6749 of the world. 
3) In our template: 4 ksZ. 12. 


488 : 


Luther's Chronikon. 


W. xiv, E-E. 489 








Different also in this way: 1656 until the flood. 
Gen. 5. 


292 until the birth of Abraham. Gen. 11. 425 until the 
birth of Moses. 
80 except for the Exodus from Egypt. 480 until the 
temple of Solomon. 
158 until King Jehoash and the end of Solomon's 
tribe. 
291 to On the Way of the Jechaniah. 
11 years of Zidekia's to devastation. 
70 years of devastation except for Cyrus. 
46 years until the second year of Darius, that is 
the beginning of the weeks. 
483 years or 69 weeks until Christ's death. 7 years of 
the last week. 


About all these parts of the calculation | have no 
doubt at all. Therefore, also the sum cannot be 
questioned, except in one piece, which goes from the 
end of the desolation to the beginning of the weeks, 
or from Cyrus to the second year of Darius, about 
which | want to say a ripple, which moves me. 

Joh. 2, 20. The Jews say to Christ: "This temple 
was built in forty-six years, and you want to erect it in 
three days? By this word it is quite certain that more 
than forty-six years elapsed between the first year of 
Darius and Cyrus and the completion of the temple. 
For it is clear from the seventh chapter of Ezra [Ezra 
6:15] that the temple was completed, not in the 
second year of Darius or the forty-sixth after Cyrus, 
when the word of God went out through Haggai and 
Zechariah at the beginning of the weeks, but in the 
sixth year of the intestines. Thus, four years are 
added to the forty-six years mentioned, and there are 
full fifty years full of Cyrus until the completion of the 
temple. Only this circumstance causes a question 
because of the four years, should everything be sure 
and certain. This question arises because of the 
uncertainty of the years of the Persian kings. 
Because the historians deviate fully from each other, 
not only in the years of Cyrus, but also of Darius and 
others. 

| want to hand over my thoughts about these four 
years to the public; whoever wants to or can, may 
suggest and judge better. Daniel lets in the 5th and 
6th chapter 


Darilis the Mede and Cyrus the Persian, each ruling 
separately, since he says [Dan. 5:31] that Darius the 
Mede succeeded Belfazer in ruling over the 
Chaldeans, and does not add Cyrus. Likewise, as he 
says [Dan. 6, 28.], "Daniel was mighty in the kingdom 
of Darius, and also in the kingdom of Cyrus the 
Persian." Not as if it were therefore false that Cyrus 
reigned at the same time as Darius, as is the way of 
Scripture when it is read that the sons reigned with 
the fathers, but that a distinction must be made 
between the reign of Cyrus with Darius and the reign 
of Cyrus alone. | say this because it seems 
necessary to understand the first year of Cyrus (2 
Chron. 36 [v. 22] and Ezra 1 [v. 1]) as the first year 
when Cyrus ruled alone and after Darius. Thus two 
years are taken away from these four years, which 
are zll much, and only two years remain in question, 
which | would like to take away so: 

Since in great kingdoms and _ dominions, 
especially when they are new, what one intends to do 
proceeds slowly and with great hindrance before it is 
set in motion, it could happen that the commandment 
of Cyrus has hardly gone out at the end of his first 
year, so that one year has passed over it. After that, 
it seems necessary to give at least one year for the 
preparation of the Jews, in which they prepared for 
the return after the command was given, rather for 
the occupation of Jerusalem, so that it can be said 
that it went well and they hurried very much, because 
they started to build at the end of the second year or 
in the third year of Cyrus. So the remaining two years 
are lost and the text Joh. 2, that the temple was built 
in forty-six years, will stand firm. | know, of course, 
what | myself could say against it, but | do not care 
much. 

But whoever wants can include these two years of 
Darius Medus in the seventy years of desolation, but 
| will rather count them after the seventy years. For 
after Belshazzar was slain, and his kingdom was 
transferred to Darius the Mede, the Jews were 
already liberated in the matter, and the 


490 


- Luther's historical and philological writings. W. xiv, ins-1117. 


491 





The prophecies of Jeremiah were fulfilled. Therefore, 
during these two years, the Jewish people, who had 
already been liberated everywhere, were worked on and 
dealt with to send them back to their land as well, with 
Daniel struggling valiantly with his own. 

But those who do not like this may offer something 
better, or demand everything in the strongest terms: we 
will say it is a small thing, if the whole calculation is 
certain, and only in two or four years a doubt remains. 
For if everything is right until the end of the world, except 
for two or four years, the faith and the church are not in 
great danger thereby; we can with a good conscience in 
so great a matter, that is, in the course of the whole 
world, leave four years unnoticed. 

Only of this | want to remind him who lets himself be 
reminded that | firmly and unshakably hold to the opinion 
that the beginning of the weeks is to be set at no other 
place than in the second year of Darius Longimanus, so 
that he knows that he makes himself vain trouble who 
intends to dispute or argue with me about this matter. 
Yes, | have (as | said) made this calculation for myself 
alone, and | am ready to bear it with the greatest 
equanimity if someone else wants to work out another 
one for himself or for others. | base myself alone on 





the holy scripture. Therefore, | am also forced to reject 
Philo, although reluctantly, who puts eighteen years too 
much in one place within the weeks of Daniel. And | do 
not care much where Alexander, Antiochus Epiphanes, 
the Maccabees and others are placed, although | place 
them, but | am not very concerned whether | place them 
in the right place or not, since only in the meantime the 
years of the weeks keep their course unharmed and 
quite certainly. 

Thus | am also forced to deviate from Metasthenes 
by twelve years. For if Metasthene's calculation and the 
numbers of the Assyrian kings should be correct, then it 
would necessarily follow that Sanherib would have come 
to Jerusalem in the second year of Hezekiah, which is 
impossible. For in the sixth year of Hezekiah, 
Shalmanasser leads all Israel away to Assyria, 2 Kings 
17, and it was not until the fourteenth year of Hezekiah 
that Sanherib came to Jerusalem, 2 Kings 18. This 
matter has caused me, while not entirely despising the 
historians, to prefer the sacred Scriptures to them. | use 
them in such a way that | am not forced to contradict the 
Scriptures. For | believe that in the Scriptures the true 
God speaks, but in the histories good people show their 
diligence and faithfulness (but as men) according to their 
ability, or at least that the copyists could have erred.

From the creation of the world and the expulsion from paradise; from sin and death and the reign of Satan. 


For Adam was already dead at that time 
when he felt the judgment of death. For 
without such feeling, death is not death, but 
sleep. Joh. 8, 52: He will not taste death 2c. 
Thus many of them die from sudden fright, 
and a still greater part is consumed by 
sadness. Thus David confesses in many 
places that he was saved from the deepest 
hell, that is, from the right eternal death that 
he tasted.

In the first year grace is promised 
against sin, life against death, the Holy 
Spirit against the devil, through the seed of 
the woman. Through this promise, Adam 
and Eve are made alive again through faith 
from death, and beget Cain and Abel, and 
the Church of God begins to multiply. But 
soon after, Cain, the apostate, establishes 
tthe Church of the Devil.

Dear God, what did these two people 
alone have to do for so many years after 
[Abel was murdered and Cain was rejected? 
No doubt they mourned these terrible 
levents and the so sad and unfortunate 
beginning of the world. 


No more wretched man has ever been, 
nor will ever be, than our first father was. 
For he is burdened with this terrifying 
conscience, that he alone, through his sin, 
has been the causative cause of the 
destruction of the body and soul of all his 
descendants, that is, of the entire human 
race. He is a killer, first of himself, then also 
lof all his children, until the end of the world, 
that is, of countless souls. How could he 
have lived even for a moment if he had 
considered this, if God Himself had not 
kindly promised him through the angels and 
said: "Do not despair, Adam, | will make up 
for this infinitely great evil and send My Son, 
who shall be of your flesh, also your son. 
He will take away this sin completely and 
save the lineage of your children.

What they suffered is easy to take 
away, namely the sting of the serpent and 
the despair and similar fierce temptations, 
likewise the annoying examples of the 
church of Cain. For it is believed that Cain 
begat children and built a church before 
Seth was born. Yes, he built a city and 
established a beautiful worldly government. 


Therefore, perhaps, among the pagans 
from dark antiquity remained this fable that 
ithe old Saturnus ate all his children. 


- Seth is born in the 130th year of Adam and 
Eve.

But it is reasonable to believe that it 
was a great comfort to Adam and Eve that 
they saw faith in the promised seed in these 
their descendants. 


But after Adam was dead, Enoch was a 
special comfort to others, being taken away 
into the life of the Seed who gives life after 
tthe death of Adam who sinned. 


-Adam dies in the 930th year of his age. 

Adam lived so many years in faith in the 
promised seed, even though he died daily 
from the serpent's sting. For one must not 
think that the serpent was calm. 


Adam dies in Christ, the seed of the 
woman. When he departs, he leaves 
behind him a world in which the kingdom of 
Cain is flourishing, but the kingdom of the 
seed is weak and small in the church of 
Seth and the following fathers.

Except for the Flood, all the fathers (and 
perhaps the Holy Church of Cain shone 
leven more by this appearance) lived 
without meat, without fish, without wine, no 
doubt also without silk, gold, silver clothes. 
But their food was fruits of trees, herbs and 
roots, which were very good and healthy at 
that time, so that they did not pay attention 
to meat at all. 

The water was also very healthy, and 
better than our specimens before the earth 
was spoiled by the flood. "One apple was 
better than three of our apothecaries. That 
is why they have not been plagued by so 
many diseases and have lived very long.

his father Sem. 


The most terrifying of all terrifying 
things, not only in all histories, but also in 
tthe Holy Scriptures themselves, except for 
the crucifixion of the Son of God and the 
Last Judgment, is this, that through the 
Flood not only the church of Cain and the 
serpent was destroyed from the bottom up, 
but also the church of the seed and the 
children of God, so that not more than eight 
souls remained and were preserved. How 
many brothers, grandparents, mothers, 
blood friends, brothers-in-law and friends of 
Noah perished, who were _ perhaps 
considered to be the most distinguished of 
his church! Fear the Lord and do not defy 
the title of the church. 

One question: How is Arphachsad born 
2 years after the flood, since he is the third 
son of Shem? Gen. 10. 

Answer: He is the first according to the 
birth, but the third according to the number. 
Or else, he is mentioned here as the first, 
like Shem, who was the second, and 
Abraham, who was the third.

The flood lasts one year and 10 days. 
But the calculators (like also Philo) start 
from the beginning of the flood; as if it is 
said: Shem begat Arphachad 2 years after 
ithe flood, namely after the beginning of the 
flood. But those who want to calculate from 
ithe end of the flood, may add one year to 
this calculation.

It seems that these fathers hurried to 
beget children after the great misfortune of 
tthe human race. Otherwise, they would 
have pined away longer, as Adam did after 
Abel. 


-Eber is born in the 30th year of his father 
Salah, and in the 67th year after the flood, 
and has lived until the 51st year before the 
passage of Israel to Egypt. So near are the 
flood and the servitude in Egypt. Therefore 
Moses 1 Mos. 10 calls Shem a father of all 
children Eber. Because Eber lived the 
longest among all fathers after the flood, 
namely 64 years after Abraham, as will 
follow afterwards. From this the Eberians 
have the name.

The building of the Tower of Babel, 
almost 100 years after the Flood, almost in 
tthe 700th year of Noah. Since he lived, 
ruled and taught about the so great wrath of 
God, the godless people despised him with 
his whole church and his descendants, the 
most holy fathers, by forgetting so soon the 
so terrifying wrath of God. 

Do you not think that it was a suffering 
to Noah and his people that his children 
should do this and that he should be taken 
for a fool by them?

Therefore it is easy to answer the 
question: how Abraham could have taken 
his brother Haran's daughter as wife? As, 
perhaps, the persecution of Nimrod urged 
them to marry so closely; however, it could 
lalso be said that Sarah was Haran's 
daughter according to the law, namely from 
la widow, whom he had taken, so that it is 
not necessary to invent shameful examples 
here, if it is already admitted that Jisca and 
Sarah were one wife, as the Hebrews want, 
inamely a daughter of Haran. But because 
Sara is another than Jisca, namely, not a 
niece of Tarah, but his daughter, as it can 
lbe seen, she could have been born of a 
woman, whom Tarah later took as a widow, 
Iso that she would be Tarah's daughter 
laccording to the law, as the words of 


Abraham read (Gen. 20): She is truly my|! 


sister, because she is my father's daughter, 
namely according to the law, but not my 
mother's daughter, that is, she is not his 
natural daughter.

About this time, | believe, Haran was 
born, the firstborn son of Tarah, the father

eed From this it follows that the children of 

Israel were in Egypt 121 years after the 
death of Levi until the Exodus, and 41 years 
from Levi until the birth of Moses. During 
this time they were nevertheless ruled by 
Kohath, the son of Levi, and Amram, the 
grandson of Levi, perhaps also by other 
holy men, especially from the tribe of 
2319 Judah, as Ram and Aminadab, so that they 
must not say they were abandoned. 

Levi came in with his sons 

Gerson, 

Kahath, 

Merari, Gen. 46. 
Kahath begat Amram. 
Amram begat Moses, Ex 6. 

Therefore, Amram alone was born and 

died in Egypt. 
2320 Kahath was not born in Egypt, but died. 
Moses was born in Egypt, not then died.

At this time Pharaoh's — cruel 
commandment went out to kill the infants of 
tthe Hebrews. But it was not fulfilled by the 
worshippers. 

It seems that Aaron was one of the 
children who were kept alive against 
Pharaoh's commandment by the womb- 
mothers, who did not want to kill the 
children, but feared God more than the 
tyrant. For an even more cruel 
commandment to drown the children soon 
followed, which struck Moses when he was 
born. 

Nota. 

Lyra puts only 210 years of living in 
Egypt. Therefore, 2 Mos. 12 fails to make 
ithe 430 years full, because he does not find 
more than 425 years, and calculates it like 
this: Abraham is called from Haran in his 
75th year, 1 Mos. 12, and begat Isaac in his’ 
100th year. From the birth of Isaac to the 
procession to Egypt are 190 years. In Egypt 
they remain 210 years (according to the 
opinion of the Hebrews): so there are not 
more than 25 years, which can be counted 
ito these 400; so there are missing 5 years 
lof the world. But we put with Moses 2 Mos. 
12 and with Paul Gal. 3 simply full 430 
ears from the occupation of Abraham to 
the departure from Egypt. Therefore we 
give 215 years to the dwelling in Egypt. In 
this way we are superior to the Hebrews 
questions with their 210 years. For it is the 
habit of the scripture to start the calculation 
high, as can be seen in the whole view of 








the judges.

But we want to assume: 

Salma had begotten Boaz from Rahab 
in the 17th year after they came to the land 
lof Canaan. 

Let Obed be born in the 110th year of 
Boaz of Ruth the Moabitess. 

Let Jesse be born in the 114th year of 
Obed son of Boaz. 

Let David be born in the 100th year of 
Jesse his father, and let him be king in his 
30th year, anointed in his 20th year, as 
follows. 

Now from the birth of Boaz to the birth 
of David are 350 years. If now the remaining 
50 years are divided among these 3 fathers, 


Boaz, Obed and Isai, so that 16 or 17 are|! 


added to each; as, Boaz is 117 years, since 
he begat Obed, Obed is 117 years, since he 
begat Isai, Isai is 116 years, since he begat 
David, then it is not necessary to write three 
Boaz, and is also nothing impossible, 
because Abraham in his 120th year begat 
children with Keturah, Genesis 25. And the 
scripture makes Boaz and Jesse very old, 
tthe one when he begat Obed, and the other 
when he begat David. Also Ehud was over 
100 years old when he died and reigned 80 
years. 

The five books of Moses were written at this time. 
Forty years in the desert, full of great miracles and 
histories, are found in 4 books of Moses, namely Exodus, 
Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. But the stories of the 
first 2 years of the Exodus are described from Exodus 14 


to the end, then in the whole third book up to the 15th 
chapter of the fourth. But the histories, which happened 


in the last year, that is, in the 40th year of the exodus, go| 1 


from the 20th chapter of the fourth book up to the gDM 
fifth book. For Aaron dies 123 years alk, that is, in the 
120th year of Moses, as is clear from the text. 

Therefore nothing was written or happened in the 
desert for 38 years, except what is read in the 4th book 
lof Moses Cap. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19, unless we want to say 
that many things were written without right order of time 
(per varepov irporepov).

Uoshua; a very whimsical Blich when you

Assume that Boaz was born here of 
Salma, namely in the 17th year after your 
lentry into the country. Because the book of 
Chronicles and the two evangelists Lucas 
land Matthew count only one Boaz, likewise 
tthe book Ruth at the end, we cannot keep’ 
it with the Jews, and put three Boaz. 


Now under Joshua and Athniel the evil 
deeds happened, which are described in 
the 1st and 2nd chapter of the judges, when 
Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was still alive, 
who is called there (as it can be seen)

The histories of the judges teach that 
under and after Joshua, the neighboring 
nations wanted to destroy the kingdom of 
Israel and avenge the Cananites, not even 
tolerating these new invaders in their land. 
Therefore, one nation after another 
conspired and fought against the people of 
God without ceasing, so that even the kings 
after the judges had no peace until the 
Babylonian captivity. Thus one heretic after 


another, one tyrant after another wants to|! 


destroy the church. Thus the Scripture 
indicates that God alone is the protector of 
His own in the midst of the enemies, Ps 
110:6.

You see that before the kings there was 
not a certain succession of rulers from a 
certain tribe, but the Lord was their duke 
land king; as Gideon says, "I will not be lord 
lover you, but the Lord" 2c. [Judges 8.] And 
to Samuel, "They have not rejected thee, 
but me, that | should not be king over them." 
Therefore he chose the rulers now from this 
tribe, soon from that tribe. 

It is not the succession of bishops that 
makes a bishop in the Church, but the Lord 
lalone is our bishop. He raises bishops 
where, which, and when he wills, as we see 
in Jerome, Augustine, Ambrose, Hus, and 
in ourselves, setting aside the succession 
that the papists boast of. 


Nota. 

The time of the judges from the death 
lof Moses to Samuel is 357 years, Joshua 
included, as you see yourself. And the 
calculation is not missing, because in the 
first book of the Kings, Cap. 6, from the 
Exodus to the temple of Solomon 480 years 
are counted. 

Therefore, it is an obvious error in the 
Acts of the Apostles, Cap. 13, by a mistake 
lof the scribes. The Latin translation is 
doubly wrong, because it puts 450 years 
before the judges, during the distribution of 
ithe land, and forces Lyra to go back to the 
years of Isaac. The Greek text, however, is 
falsified by error of the scribe, which could 
easily happen by writing Terpaxoaio” for 
rpeaxoffloit. 

For so Paul says: He tolerated their 
ways 40 years in the wilderness (here you 
see that Moses is included), after that he 
gave them judges about (quasi) 350 years, 
until out of Samuel. From then on they 
asked for a king, and God gave them Saul 
the son of Kish for 40 years.

-Gideon 40 years, Judg. 8, against the 
Midianites. 


Here you see that Samuel and Saul are 
lespecially excluded from the 350 years, so 
that the same 350 years remain in the time 
lof the judges. But that he speaks "against" 
(quasi), happens because about 8 or 7 
ears exceed the round number of years, 
which he alone wanted to count. So does 
Jephthah with his round 300 years, because 
he omits 6, which are over it.

the actual office of the priests, nor 
hereditary, to be a judge, or to govern the 
people, but to sacrifice, and to serve the 
tabernacle, as is clear from the books of 
Moses. Lyra says to the Jews that Eli held 
the high priestly office with his sons, 
because Eleazar's descendants were unfit 
people, since his sons carried the ark of the 
Lord and lost it. But this proves nothing. 

The history of Micah [Judges 17 and 18] 
happened before Ehud, soon after the 
death of Joshua. For it is said there that the 
tribe of Dan had not yet received its portion 
lof the land, but had only begun to seek it. 

Nor is it a wonder that idolatry has been 
among pious judges, because it was under 
Moses himself (as Amos testifies, and 
Stephen cites Apost. 7) and under Joshua, 
las he himself testifies Jos. 24 and Judges.

- Eli 40 years. 1 Sam. 4. 

The slackness of this man is sufficiently| 
shown by the fact that he allowed his sons 
to have their will and did not see to it that 
the people were taught. Therefore the 
scripture [1 Sam. 3] says: "The word of the 
Lord was precious", because he did not wait 
for his office with teaching and ruling. 
Therefore every man did as he pleased, 
because there was no king in Israel. And 
therefore he was also cut off. 

When Samuel is 30 years old, as he 
begins to be a judge, he is born in the 10th 
year of Eli. 

And here begins the time of the prophets, 


as Peter says [Acts 3]: "All the prophets}, 


from Samuel and after, as many as have 
spoken of them, have proclaimed of these 
days." Therefore in Hebrew the books of the 
kings are called the great prophets, and 
rightly so. For more is written in them of the 
prophets than of the government of the 
kings.

Kings Judah. 


Rehoboam has heard of all the glorious deeds of his 
grandfather David, and even seen the glory of his father 
Solomon, yet he is a fool and idolater along with his| 
princes and the people of Judah. Is this not something 
labominable? Thus the example of Saloino, since he| 
Icommits foolishness in his highest age, has been able to 
ido more than all previous miracles. For 3 years they 
remained pious after the first example of Solomon and| 
David, soon they became idolatrous (1 Kings 15), so that| 
they also left the temple and made images, groves and 
altars for themselves. Yes, above that they also allowed) 
public fornication. These are the fruits of the will of 
courage in idolatry, as can only be seen in all histories. 
This means: The children of the heroes are vain plagues. 


Rehoboam reigns for 17 years. 


- Assa_born in that year, when he is 20 
years old, since he begat Jehoshaphat. 


With Rehoboam the scripture starts to 
count the years of the age of the kings of 
Judah, but only with the kings of Judah. 
Because with the kings of Israel it counts 
lonly the years of the government, not the 
age. 


-Abia 3 years. 


- Assa 41 years. 


Jehoshaphat was born, and no doubt 
Elijah and Elisha were also born around this 
time. For Elijah almost begins to prophesy’ 
with the reign of Jehoshaphat. That is how 








close they are to Solomon and David.

Joram Israel (in the 18th year of 
Uehoshaphat) 12 years, but you see that he 
reigns 36 years; the remaining 24 years are 
silent. See the note at the end of this book. 

In these years the three kings Jehoshaphat, 
ehoram and the king Edom appear before Elisha (since 
Elijah meanwhile had his being elsewhere) and counsel 
lhim, 2 Kings 3. For this happens since Jehoshaphat is| 
still alive, who was one of these three. 

There are two Joram reigning, both ungodly, and the 
lungodly nature takes over, therefore Elijah is also finally’ 
taken away, but leaves a writing to Joram, the king of 
Judah, and prophecies of the destruction of the ungodly 
in Israel by Jehu, by Jehasiel, by Elisha, although Joram 
seems to have been an excellent man to Israel, who is| 
praised 2c. 2 Kings 3, and adorned in many ways by the| 
miraculous deeds of Elisha, as the histories testify. 


Elijah taken away. (A glorious time 
under Elijah and Elisha, and remarkable 
because of two triumphs and the death of 
many prophets, which Jezebel kills, the 
raising of the dead and the miraculous 
deeds of Elijah and Elisha, with which two 
books are half filled, namely the 1st and 
2nd Kings; therefore they are rightly called 
the great prophets.

-Joram 32 years old, reigns alone 8 years. 


- Here Joram Judah begins to rule evil and to be godless, 
after he had ruled 8 years well, as long as his father's 
Ichange was in fresh memory, and his son Ahaziah 
reigns with him these 20 years, who was 22 years old, 2 
Kings 8. These 20 years of both, Joram's and Ahaziah's, 
are kept silent because of their wickedness, but so that 
Ino error arises in the histories, they are added to the age 
lof far son Ahaziah. Jerome and Lyra, 2 Chron. 22) 
Otherwise it would follow that Ahaziah was 2 years older| 
than his father Joram. And this is the most shameful 
time, about which Elijah complains so much that he also 
wishes to die. So are always the best prophets at the| 
worst times.

who heard Jonah and repented. He divided 
tthe Assyrian kingdom with Arbaces after 
the death of Sardanapalus, and kept 
[Assyria and Babylon, but gave Media and 
Persia to Arbaces. His descendants left 
Nineveh and built Babylon and a palace

Earthquake. 


A manifest error that Uzziah became 
leprous in the year of the earthquake, of 
which Amos says, because he presumed 
the priestly office, since this earthquake 
happened under Jeroboam, and Jotham 
was born only 11 years after Jeroboam's 
death, and could not rule the royal house 
before he was born. Therefore, he became 
la leper around the 40th year of his reign, or 
before, since Jotham was 12 or more years 
old, and was able to rule the royal house. 

“About this time, | believe, Isaiah 
began, since he was over 30 years old, 
which is the age of Christ, in which also 
Ezekiel begins, as it is said there. Thus 100 
years are found, in which he prophesied, up 
to the 10. year Mauasse.

Hosea, the last king over Israel, reigned 9 years. 
Therefore, the word 2 Kings 15: "Hosea killed Pekah in 
ithe 20th year of Jotham, and became king in his place", 
must be understood in such a way that one makes a 
division (divisive). Namely, he slew Pekah in the 20th 
year of Jotham, and he became king in his place over 9 
years later, not in the year he slew him. Such speech is 
lalso found elsewhere, as above. 


Guiding Israel Away. 


Israel is taken away and its kingdom 
comes to an end. It is brought to Assyria by 


Salmanasser (2 Kings 17) in the 6th year of 
Hezekiah, and 9th year of Hosea. The 
kingdom of Israel stood 299 years. Isaiah 
prophesied about this misery and saw it in 
his old age. 


We want to assume that Isaiah began 
in the 22nd year of Uzziah (when he was 
almost 32 years old) and was killed in the 
10th year of Manasseh, so he prophesied 
96 years, and next to him Hosea and Micah 
at least 70 or 60 or 80 years; as is clear from 
tthe number of the years of Uzziah, Jotham, 
Ahaz and Hezekiah.

-Hezekiah in his 25th year, reigns 29 years. 


In these years the greatest miraculous 
signs happen through Isaiah, namely, 
Sanherib is defeated, Jerusalem is 
liberated by the power of the angels, the 
course of heaven is changed for the sake 
lof Hezekiah (which is unbelievable), that 
tthe sun goes back, and makes one day 
three days long. And what is the greatest, 
there are such prophecies of Christ, which 
are almost clearer than the Gospel, through 
Isaiah, Hosea, and Micah. 

A golden age in spirit, and yet, by 
lexceedingly great repugnance, miserable 
in the flesh, well worth that in the same the 
devil, by killing so many saints through the 
[Assyrians and through Manasseh, proved 
that his damnation and the salvation of the 
lelect would truly come. 


Manasseh_ 12 years old, reigns 55 
years. 

A great murderer of prophets, who filled 
Jerusalem with blood (as it says in 
Chronicles) up to the top, or from one* gate 
to the other. He also killed Isaiah, the 
conqueror of the Assyrians and the 
liberator of the fatherland. "This is how to 
thank and serve GOD" with murders of 
those who teach mercy and_ not 
righteousness of works. Oh, let us stop

Manasseh imprisoned 10 years, 
seriously repents of his iniquity, 2 Chron. 
33. 

These 10 years, Philo says, Amon 
reigned in the absence of the father. But 
[Amon was then a boy of 10 or 9 years, so 
lhe ruled through the princes and priests, as 
Uehoash ruled through Jehoiada, 2 Kings 
11. So also Josiah ruled, since he was 8 
years old. 

The question arises: whether Josiah is 
la natural son of Amon, because there are 
lionly 16 years between the birth of both of 
them? whether it is to say that Amon has 
been born in the 
15. years fathered children? 

How is Josiah a father of Josacim 
landJoahaz, since Josiah is only 14 years 
lold when Jehoiakim is born, and 16 years 
lold when Jehoahaz is born? But Matthew is 
silent about these, and makes Jechansa 
tthe son of Josiah. Yes, he was falsified, 
because the 14th member is omitted (which 
lhe nevertheless promises), namely 
Uehoiakim, the father of Jechaniah.

Of the correspondence between the

with this Mardachai, believing that he lived

goes astray, and confuses the reckoning of

"The scepter shall not be taken away from 
Judah" 2c., because here among the 
Maccabees both the principality and 
priesthood cease, at least in the natural line. 
And Jeremiah cried out with many words 
that there should never fail a son of David, 
who sits on his throne before the Lord 
forever. 
But 

Isaiah prophesied Cap. 11 that Christ 
would arise from the root of Jesse, that is, 
after the tribe would be dead on earth and it 
would be in despair. Thus the line of David 
perishes here. But such are the works of 
God, that he kills and makes alive. So out 
lof the (So many years) dead tribe of David 
arises the rod of Jesse, Christ. For as the 
70 years preserved the people at Babylon 
by the promises, so the 70 weeks (without 
throne and king) preserve the same people 
until Christ, by the same promise.

A new disease, called the French or

lof the great signs before the Last Day. 

And under this Maximilian, miraculous 
signs, and many of them, have taken place 
in the heavens, and also on the earth and 
in the waters, of which Christ has said that 
there will be great signs, so that it is not

Which give us the certain hope that the

It is to be hoped that the end of the world is near, for the sixth thousand of the years of the 
world will not be full, just as the three days of Christ's death have not been full, so I divide thus:

The first of the Sabbath - Sunday 


( morning dawns. 


has not been fulfilled, but He rose in the morning, that is, in the middle of the third day, just as He 
was caught in the middle of the first day; so now is the middle of the sixth millennium of the world. 


In the 25th year of Uzziah, king of Judah, the first Olympiad begins. 
Darius Longimanus in the 78th Olympiad, in her 4th year. 
Alexander the Great in the IM Olympiad, in its 2nd year. 

Augustus in the 184th Olympiad, in her 3rd year. 

Christ born in the 194th Olympiad, in her 4th year. 

Christ died in the 203rd Olympiad, in their 3rd year. 


But I would not like me or anyone to be tormented about whether the Olympiads are certain, 


since we have the certainty of the Holy Scriptures. 


From the seventy weeks of Daniel. 


Now let us look at Daniel about the seventy 
weeks. [Dan. 9, 25.:]"From the time that the 
command went out that Jerusalem should be built 
again" 2c. We do not want to concern ourselves 
with the different opinions (in this piece), but 
accept the one, namely that the going out of the 
command is to be understood in such a way that it 
took its beginning in the second year of Darius, 
since the command, not of a man, but of God, went 
out through Haggai and Zechariah. And it is not 
necessary to place the beginning of this going out 
or the command in the year in which it was 
revealed to Daniel. For it was revealed to him (as 
it says above [v. I] in the text) in the first year of 
Darius and Cyrus, when the seventy years of| 
desolation were already fulfilled and finished. So 


where it would be revealed to Jeremiah, namely 
in the fourth year of Zedekiah or Jehoiakim, as 
some Jews and Lyra do. For Daniel and 2 Chron. 
36 and the first chapter of Ezra teach sufficiently 
that the years of desolation began with the 
destruction of Jerusalem. And the word of 
Jeremiah about the desolation has nothing to do 
with this command, about which Daniel receives 
a new revelation after the end of the seventy 
years, since the word had already gone out that 
the captivity should be lifted. For Jeremiah says 
nothing of the rebuilding of Jerusalem, but of the 
people being brought back after seventy years, 
which was done and fulfilled. 

Therefore the angel prophesies of a new word 
according to the word of Jeremiah, and he does 


it is also not necessary to assume the beginning of| not show him the beginning of the going forth. 


these seventy years at that time. 


For he prophesies future things, not for 


716 


Luther's Chronikon. W. xiv, 1288--1291-. 


717 





Daniel, but for his people. The angel divides the 
seventy weeks into seven weeks, sixty-two weeks, 
and one week; namely, in seven weeks the streets 
and the trenches will be restored in a short time. That 
this is fulfilled is taught by the book of Nehemiah, who 
came in the twentieth year of Darius, and barely 
completed the walls, since in the meantime, from the 
second year of Darius, they had suffered many things 
in that puny time for eighteen years, in that the 
Gentiles prevented the work that was commanded by 
the word of God. For before that, from the time of 
Cyrus, the work had lain wholly idle for twenty-four 
years, being forbidden by Cambyses, king of the 
Persians. 

Therefore the angel gives seven weeks, that is, 
forty-nine years, for the restoration of Jerusalem. For 
in so many years, from the second year of Darius, 
Jerusalem was hardly rebuilt, so that it had streets 
and ditches (as the angel speaks), that is, that it had 
a well-ordered regiment in the streets and was at 
peace, and ditches, that is, walls, fortifications 
against war and enemies. "There is a time to set up 
acity, both for regiment and against the enemies, that 
both may go and stand in pregnancy." 

These years are fulfilled in the fifth year of 
Artaxerxes Mnemon, when Nehemiah and the priest 
Jehoiakim were still reigning 2c. 

[Dan. 9, 26.:] "And after the sixty-two weeks Christ 
shall be cut off, and there shall be no more." The 62 
weeks are 434 years, which together with the 49 
years or 7 weeks make 483 years. That is how many 
years there are from the second year of Darius. After 
this year, namely the 483rd year, immediately in the 
beginning of the following year, which is the first of 
the last week, and the beginning of the 34th year of 
Christ's life,-in this very year (| say) Christ is cut off, 
as here the angel speaks, and the last week follows, 
of which it will soon be said. 

This word: "And be no more", or, what our Latin 


interpreter adds from his own and says: Et non erit 


populus ejus, qui eum negaturus est, must rather be 
understood in such a way that Christ, exterminated 





from the land of the living and crucified by the Jews, 
will have nothing of the Mosaic law nor of any carnal 
worship, but also nothing of the world regiment or of 
the house regiment, but his kingdom will be a spiritual 
and eternal one in righteous justice and holiness. Ps. 
16:4: "I will not sacrifice their libation with the blood." 
"All things are become new" [2 Cor. 5, 17. Isa. 43, 
19.]. And elsewhere [Jn. 4, 21.], "Ye shall not worship 
in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem." [Ps. 16, 4.:] "I will 
not put her name in my mouth.” By this well-chosen 
word "cut off," the angel indicates that Christ would 
die and rise again, bringing righteousness and life 
without law and works. Therefore follows [Dan. 9, 27:] 

"He will strengthen the covenant of many A week." 
Read Peter's sermons, Apost. Cap. 3. 4 2c., and 
Paul's Apost. 13 and this whole book, in which they 
teach that through JEsum all things are fulfilled unto 
their children. And so it is evident what the angel 
wants. Now this week is to be considered like the 
feast of the Passover, in which they celebrated the 
whole week long. So also this week of the right and 
fulfilled Passover was exceedingly glorious and holy 
through the powers and miracles of the Holy Spirit 
and through the mighty and wonderful speeches in all 
languages. 

"And in the midst of the week the sacrifice and 
meat offering shall cease." This was done Apost. 15, 
since it was established by public pronouncement in 
the Concilium of the Apostles that the burden of the 
Law must be lifted from the necks of the disciples. 
This happened about the third or fourth year after the 
resurrection, that is, in the middle of the last week. 

How miserably blinded are the Jews, who so 
foolishly reject the exceedingly salutary promise of 
the weeks! For so Jeremiah, by the promise of the 
seventy years, upheld the people in captivity, that 
they might know that deliverance from that calamity 
was sure. Thus, since it should happen that after the 
return from captivity they should be afflicted with 
calamities not much less (for in Babylon they are 
surely honored quite gloriously 


718 


Luther's historical and philological writings. 


W. xiv, 1291--1293.._ 719 








(The time of the end of the world has already passed, 
both through the kings and through the most excellent 
prophets, Daniel, Ezekiel 2c.), God gives them the 
consolation that promises that these evils will not last 
longer than seventy weeks. Then Christ himself will be 
there, who will put an end to all evils through an eternal 
redemption. But they [the Jews] 


make the end of the weeks the beginning of the time 
when Christ should be expected at an uncertain time. By 
excluding themselves from the predestined time, they 
plunge into the chaos of an indefinite and never coming 
time, and cheat themselves of the so salutary promise. 


Difficulties in this calculation of the years of the world. 


There are two difficulties in this calculation of the 
years of the world. The one comes from the story of 
Stephen in the Acts of the Apostles, Cap. 7, 4, to whom 
Lucas puts this word into the mouth, that Abraham was 
brought from Haran to the land of Canaan after the death 
of his father Tharah. If this is true, it follows that Abraham 
was born in the 130th year of his father Tharah. For 
Abraham was 75 years old when he went out of Haran, 
that is, after the death of his father (as Stephen says), 
but Tharah lived 205 years. So it is clear that Abraham 
was born in the 130th year of his father Tharah. 

On the other hand it is written in Gen. 11, 26 that 
Tharah was seventy years old when he begat Abraham, 
Nahor and Haran. But it would be intolerable and a great 
impertinence to say that Moses writes that Abraham was 
60 years old before he was born. For if he was born in 
the 130th year of his father (as the narrative of Stephen 
reads), and yet (as Moses says) was born in his 70th 
year, it follows that he was born 60 years before he was 
born. That would mean (as | have said) to take out too 
much. 

Which of both opinions you want to follow, you will be 
free for my sake, but it will be difficult to improve Moses. 
| hold it with Moses, namely that Abraham was really 
born in the 70th year of his father, then went away from 
Haran 60 years before the death of his father. Thus the 
60 years do not fall away from the number of the years 
of the world. Further | believe that Tharah begat his 
firstborn son Haran approximately in the thirtieth year of 
his age. Because you see that so all other fathers, Peleg, 


Eber, Salah 2c., about the thirtieth year children have 
begotten, namely since they hurried to fill again the 
world empty after the sin flood. Therefore it is to be 
believed that also Tharah after her example and use 
around the thirtieth year had children, namely the 
firstborn son Haran about in the thirtieth, afterwards the 
Nahor about in the fortieth, finally the Abraham in the 
seventieth, and perhaps from another, namely a 
younger woman. For he himself calls Sarah his sister, 
the daughter of his father, not of his mother, or more 
correctly a niece, who descended from his brother 
Haran. But Abraham [Gen. 11, 26.] is called first, 
although he is the youngest, because he was actually 
born in the seventieth year [of Tharah]. At the same time 
Moses gives a reminder: since he writes that the three 
sons of Tharah were born in the same year, we are to 
think that the other two were born at another time, which 
he again mentions as born here, since he says that 
Abraham was born. Thus the sons of Noah are listed 
above as born in the same year, while only the oldest 
son Japheth was born in this year of Noah, as shown 
above. 

Regarding the story of Stephen, it can be said that it 
was not his own statement, but a story taken from the 
mouths of the people; such a story tends to be confused 
and obscure. Then the evangelists tend rather to 
indicate the passages of Scripture than to cite them, and 
are content to have briefly referred to them and to the 
sources themselves. For see Matthew in the first 
chapter, how the genealogical register does not agree 
with the histories. At the same time, it cannot be denied 
that the 


720 


that this very passage, Apost. 7, has been corrupted 
in more than one way by some wise men. Yours: This 
is an obvious error, that he says that the Lord 
appeared to him in Mesopotamia before he lived in 
Haran, and that he left Chaldea afterwards. 
Mesopotamia is put for Chaldea, unless you let 
Chaldea be located in Mesopotamia. Otherwise, he 
had long since moved from Chaldea. See the 
Augustine in the first book "of the questions about 


the first book of Moses", and de civitate Dei, lib. 16., 
cap. 15. 


The other difficulty is in the years of Jehoram king 
of Judah and his son Ahaziah. 

Here all calculators leave out 20 years, which 
becomes clear from this: Of Ahaziah it is written in 2 
Chron. 22, 2. that he was 42 years old. Again 2 Kings 
8, 26 that he was 22 years old. Therefore, if the book 
of Chronicles tells the truth, Ahaziah will be 2 years 
older than his father Joram. This becomes clear: 
Joram is 32 years old when he becomes king and 
reigns 8 years; that makes a total of 40 years. 


Luther's Chronikon. 


W. xiv, 1293-12m. 721 
By this opinion (if someone wanted to follow it) one 
would be forced to say that Ahazja was a son of 


Joram according to the law (legal). But it is against 
this that his mother Athaliah, the wife of Joram, is 
called the mother of Ahaziah. But in the scripture not 
the mothers of children are called "mothers" 
according to the law, but only the mothers of natural 
children. 

| follow therefore the opinion of Jerome and Lyra, 
namely that Joram reigned 28 years. However, 
twenty years are in the history with silence transitions 
because of his wickedness, in which he ruled 
ungodly and tyrannically, but these years are 
indicated in the age of his son Ahazja, so that no 
error arose in the history. Thus Joram, the father, 
becomes 18 or 17 years older than his youngest son 
Ahaziah. 

If this opinion holds, which | like to follow, it will 
happen that the last year of the last week is just the 
fourth thousandth year of the world, as you see in the 
Chronikon. 


Notes. 


Resolve these problems. 


18. years Jehoshaphat the father, 2 Kings 3:1. 
1. the first, Joram Israel becomes king 2. years Joram, the son, 2 Kings 1, 17. 
The second: Joram Judah becomes king in the 5th year of Joram Israel, 2 Kings 8:16. How can one and the 


same year be at the same time the 2nd year of Joram Judah and the 1st year of Joram Israel, yes, at 


the same time also the 5th of Joram Israel? 


3rd' The third: Anaziah Judah becomes king in the 12th year of Joram Israel, 2 Kings 8:25, while from the 
2nd year of Joram Judah to the last year of Joram Israel are 15 years. 
The description of this time of Elijah and Elisha is very confused, just as the kingdom was in very great 
disorder at that time because of the idolatry and ungodliness of Jezebel. 
Set it as shown on the next page. 
signifies the 16th year of Jehoshaphat, and after it the son Joram begins to reign with the father in 


the 17th year [of Jehoshaphat]. 


Mes is the 3047th year of the world.Z 
Joram Israel becomes king, but ins unrest; < 


but after 3 years at rest. 


-Joram, 23 years old, reigns with his father for 9 
years. 


So the first problem is solved, that the 2nd year of Joram Judah, and the 1st year of Joram Israel and 
the 18th year Jehoshaphat are one and the same year, if you connect end and beginning with each other.

These are the 12 years of Joram Israel. < 7

And so the second problem is solved, namely 
that Joram Judah becomes king in the 5th year 


(namely at the beginning of the same) of Joram 
Israel. 
Take a leap over 20 years. te -Ahaziah, 22 years old, 2 Kings 8:26, reigns with 


his father 20 years.

2 Kings 9, 29: In the 11th ( Ahaziah king namely s at the end / 


[This is the year 3065 of the world.] { Thus the third problem is solved, that the 12th 
2 year of Joram Israel is the first of Ahaziah, since 
3 these years coincide in their beginning and end. 
4 Therefore, one must be careful to distinguish in 
5 the words a twofold understanding of the word 
6 "reign," namely, that either the son reigns with the 
7 father, or the son alone; then that the beginning of 
8 the year for one king is the end of the year for the 
2 other king. This ambiguity is a mother of error 
These 20 years are indicated in the history 10 ‘ : 

entirely with silence transitions, and alone in 11

-Athalja 7 years. 
Or do you do it better. 

Therefore distinguish the sayings according to the different times; as, Ahaziah is 22 years old, since 
he began to reign (namely with his father Joram, who reigned), 2 Kings 8:26, and he is 42 years old, since 
he reigns alone after the father. And he reigned 1 year, namely by passing by a leap over 20 years in which 
he reigned ungodly with the father. Thus the problems are solved. Only you should know that the 5th year 
in the second problem must be understood as the end of the 4th year, and just this 5th year of Joram Israel 
is the first year of Joram Judah, since he reigns alone, with concealment of 3 years of Joram Israel, since 
he reigns in unrest. So you must understand the 12th year of Joram Israel from the beginning of the year, 
because in this very year Ahaziah reigns with him, and both are killed in the same by Jehu. Therefore, after 
a jump over 20 omitted years, the 12th year is to be put.

Namenbichlein. W. xiv. iWi-E. 725 


2, several proper names of the Germans traced back from their original 
meaning, *) 
1537. 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


The proper names which have olf or ulf are quite 
German, as: 


Rodolphus is corrupted by the Latin, rather means 
in German "Ralhulf", that is, Rath und Hulfe. For 


salus or auxilium means "help", "council" consilium. 


Lodolphus is corrupted. German it means 
"Luidhilf" or "Leudhtlf". For Lnid 1) with a Dutch or 
Leud with a Swabian diphthong means people in the 
plural. It is therefore "Leuthulf", in Greek Alexander. 


Landolphus stands for "Landhilf", which is, the 
lands salvation or a helper of the land. 

Gangolfus stands for "Ganghilf", happy help that 
it goes on. And by changing the words, the same is 
expressed: "Hilfgang", for which "Wolfgang" is said 
backwards, as if you said a wolf is going. This 
mistake comes from the Dutch language, which still 
today twists the vowels like this: "Huolfgangus", 
when it wants to say "Hulfgang", which uninformed 
ears take for "Wolfgang". Because "wolf" is lupus. 


Arnulfus stands for "Ehrnhilt", help of honor, a 


person who can help and promote respectability and 
virtue. Because be- 


1) Incorrect in the original: Imcle. People means in Dutch: Lui. 





constantly write and speak the Latin a where the 
Germans have an e or the diphthong a, and they 
leave out the aspirations. 

Gandolfus seems to be the same as Gangolfus, 
in that the g is corrupted by the d. 


Ulfarus, that is "helper" or "helper", “in Latin] 


Salvator, Auxiliator, “in Greek’ Alexius, [in Hebrew] 
Joshua, Jesus, Esdras 2c. 


Minulfus is without doubt: My help or my 
salvation. Because "Min" in Saxon means my, 
therefore "Minhilf". 

Astulphus is "Hasthilf", hurried help. "Hast" in 
Saxon means one who hurries, who is brave, who is 
fierce. 

Agilulfus, which is either "Eilhilf", which means a 
quick, swift help, almost the same as "Hasthulf", 


because "Eil" means festinationem, speed, or what 
is nowadays in use, "Eitelhilf", corrupted "Eitelwolf", 
as if one said: full and loud help. 

"Wolfart" is quite corrupted, instead of "Hulfrat", 
because it is the transposed name "Rathhtlf", which 
is called Rudolf, as is said above. 


Adolphus is very corrupt, and it should be said 
"Hatthilf". So the Latin call the king of the 


Longobards “tbulkus. But Hatto or Hatto is the same 
as father. So still today the children in Hesse call 


*This booklet is written in Latin and was first published without Luther's name in 1537 at Wittenberg under the title: Aliquot nomina 
propria Germanorum,ad priscam etymologiam restituta per quen- dam antiquitatis studiosum Vitemb. 1537. Already in 1559 
an edition appeared in Oberursel (Ursollis), which just like the Wittenberg of 1570 has on the title the indication: Autors Reverento v. Martins 
I-ntkero. Other editions followed: one in Wittenberg in 1611; another in Helmstadt in 1673. In our Walch edition there is the remark in an old 
hand: "There is also a Wittenbergische Allsgabe of 1554 in small octavo." In 1674, a German edition by Al. Gottfried Wegener, which is 
included in the Leipzig edition, vol. XXII, appendix, p. 65 and by Walch. In Latin, our writing is printed only in the Altenburg edition, vol. IX, p. 
1592, after the Wittenberg edition, which appeared in 1570 with Peter Sech. In the past, Luther's authorship was doubted several times, 
prompted by a passage in a letter written by Erasmus to Julius Pflug in 1532: Martini Omtfiori vsstri, gnoa AUuis, cks norninidus propriis 
Oerinanornin porplaoet opnNouinrn. But this utterance is spurious < Késtlin, Maut. Luther (3), vol. Il, p. 674 a<l p. 445). Recently it is generally 
assumed that Luther is the author. Also the preceding writing, the Chronikon, offers some clues for this, e.g. the introduction of Hetta for Otto, 
Ehrnhilf for Arnulf, Rathulf for Rudolf, Ratwerd for Ruprecht 2c. We have retranslated according to the Altenburger.

double-sounding e. Thus "Hatthulf" is a helping or| 8. For the name of a certain Duke of Engern still 


saving father. And | believe that the Chatti [Katten], persists among the Germans, "Duke Hengst zu 


whom we now call Hessians, were called with the old 


word Hatti, that is fathers, and Hattia their fatherland. 
So that bishop of Bamberg was called Hatto, and 
another Otto, which is the same. For Otto has 
undoubtedly been corrupted by the Latin by omitting 
the aspiration (as they otherwise almost always do), 
instead of Hetto or Hatto. Therefore the emperors, the 


three Ottonians, must be called Haiti. Hatto post 


Hatto regnavit tertius Hatto. 1) 

And it is not surprising that our language is 
corrupted by ignorant people. Because also we have 
again, since ignorance prevailed, the Latin language 
extraordinarily corrupted. | believe that through this 
very ignorance even the main name of our nation, 
namely Germania, has been corrupted. For it is 
probable that the Latin historians were mistaken in the 
letter H and regarded and read it for G, or also that 
they did not distinguish it sufficiently by hearing, since 
a strongly aspirated H reads almost 2) like the letter 
G. Therefore, | think that our nation was formerly 
called Hermannia, just as that extremely excellent 
leader, who defeated the legions of Augustus, is 
called Arminius 3) by the Welsh in a wrong way, while 
he is in fact called "Herman", which is still a very 
common name today. But "Herman" is a man of the 
army or a leader in war. For "army" is €Xercitus or war. 
Hence one says "“Heerfart", that is, a warlike 
enterprise. Hence Hermanni, Hermannia, which 
means the warrior, the warrior. 

The same mistake has occurred also with the 
name Segestus, which was the father-in-law of 


Hermann, in that Segestus instead of 


1) This would like to be translated in such a way: One Hatto ruled 
after the other; the third was also called Hatto. Compare "Luthers 
Chronikon", in this volume Col-. 688 sf.

Engern". "Hengst" however means a riding horse, or 
a war horse, so that "Hengst" is about the same as a 


knight or Philippus, namely a horseman. And the 
bishop of Ducem 
Angrinorum, "Duke of Engern". The Latin spells it 
wrong: Angrivariorum. And England (Anglia) is 
called Engerland (Angria) by these Angris or 
"Engers". Therefore also England has still largely the 


Saxon language. 
And | leave it to others to consider whether that 


word Alemannia, too, is corrupted instead of 
"Ad.elman", Adelmannia, | suppose. 


Cologne still calls himself 


All names which have Breun or Bryn are quite 
German, as: 


Brenno or Brynno, the leader of the Gauls against 
the Romans. And nowadays the word Brenno or 
more correctly Bryn, with a Pythagorean y or a Dutch 
u, is very often in use. Hence "Brunswig" or 
"Brynswig", that is, the castle of Brennus (as they 
talk). 

Likewise "“Brennburg", which today is 
mispronounced at all courts: "Brandenburg". For the 
citizens of this city in the Mark even today call this 
city: "Brennburg", that is, the castle of Brennus, not 
“Brandenburg”. 

But it is Brynn or Brenn (as old heroic poems 
indicate) a helmet, especially the one with a plume or 
horns. Therefore Brenny is a helmeted one. And 
"Brennburg" is either the castle of Duke Brenno, or 


the guard of Brennorum, or of the helmeted and 
armed to protect the land. And the big beetle, 
helmeted with red horns and armed with brick- 
colored wings, is called "Husbrenner" in our region. 

"Hiltebrand" stands for "Heltbrenn", that is, a 
strongman (gygaS) and a hero of the Brennen, or a 
head and leader of them. Nowadays, "captain over 
the ricey stuff." Because "Helt" means a hero, as it 
were an Achilles or Hector. 


728 


Luther's Book of Names. W. xiv, 1289-1291. 


729 





Luitprand, the king of Lombardy. This stands for 
Lutbrenn, which means a helmet of the people, who 
protects the people with weapons. For we have said 
that "Luit, Lyt" or Swabian "people" denotes people in 
the plural. 

Aisbrand, king of the Longobards, is "Husbrenn", 
that is, the protector of the house, or who protects the 
house and the family with weapons. "Huis" or "Hus", 
long spoken, means a house in Saxon. 

"Fuchsbrand", that is "Fusbrenn", a soldier on foot, 
but helmeted, and it seems to be said with reference 
to "Heltbrenn" that, just as the latter is a helmeted 
knight, so the latter is a helmeted man-of-war on foot; 
nowadays: "captain over the foot soldiers" or 
"Weibel". 1) For "fus", spoken long, means a foot. So 
you see that "Brenn" is a warlike or military 
expression. 


All names ending in rich are German. 
"Friederich", [Latin] Pacificus, [Hebrew] Solomon, 


[Greekf Irenaeus. Caesar writes Viridorix, Epidorix. 
This has already become Italian through the 
Longobards, since the Italians also call a rich man 
"Ric". But it is "Rick" or "Nich", in Swabian "Reich", 
dives. So a river which has much fish is called 
"fischrich", a fertile land "kornrich", one which has 
much money "geldrich”. 

Arrigis, king of the Longobards, "Ehrrich", 
nowadays a quite common name; that is, rich in 
honor, who is in great honor. 

Alaricus, king of the Longobards, 
whom we now call "Olrich, Ulrich", but more correctly 
"Alrich", that is, who has abundance of everything, 
Pantoplusios. "Huldreich" is another name, or rather 
a name formed from new. 

Attalaricus, a king 2c., stands for "Hattalrich", that 
is, a father rich in all things. 

Emerich, that is "Jmerrich", always rich, who never 
lacks. "Hinrich," Julius Caesar calls Vercingetorix, 
but by the. 


) The last two pare of te preceding sentence are accidentally in 
ures order in the original. 


Error of the scribe with confused, staggered and 
reversed letters. For he wanted to write the Saxon 
"Hertoge Hinric", which means Duke Heinrich. And 
afterwards the scribes changed the H in V [and c] 2) 
and shifted "toge" to Hin, and made "geto" out of it. 
But this word is very well known nowadays, and 
clearly shows the errors of the old books, for in Saxon 
he is called "Hertoge Hinric", in Swabian "Herzog 


Heinrich". "Hertog" or "duke" is the same as duX. This 


comes from "Heer," which is exercitu, and "zog” or 
"to pull," which means to lead or go to war. But 
"Hinric" means as much as -at home or rich at home, 
or rich in families, the father and regent of many, as 
if one wanted to say that Abraham in Hebrew means: 
the father of many, namely families [Gen. 17, 5]. 


"Dietrich", in Greek he is called Theoderichus, 
comes from "Deud" or "Did", with a Pythagorean y 
or a Dutch u. With this name the Germans seem to 
have named God. And the historians write it with a T; 
but the universal language, which still persists with 
us, testifies that one must say "Deud" or "Did", 
although even Caesar always writes T, where he 
heard a D pronounced from the mouth of the 
Germans, as will be said later. From this "Deud" we 
Germans are called "Deudisch", which is "Deudici", 
but according to Saxon dialect "Didisch", with a 
Pythagorean y or a Dutch u. For with all such words 
one must look to the Saxon dialect, of which formerly 
all Germany made use. Thus the Germans took their 
name from GOtt, which they called "Deud" or "Did", 
as their descendants called themselves "Gottos" 
from "God", that is a Deo, which these same Gothen 
also call "Gut" today, namely the Danes, Swabians 
2c. But all Germany says "God". Because the Gothen 
were Germans. But because both "God" and "Good" 
are spoken long, it happened that the historians call 
them Gaetas, with a double sound. But "good" 
means: the good, the good. 


2) Added by us: it may have failed in the original due to a 
typographical error.

Luther's historical and philological writings. W. xiv, E-E. 731 


And it seems that this name "Diid" came from} Saxon prudence or experience, hence "Wittich" 
the Hebrew "D6d" [xxx], which means an uncle, a] the wise, the experienced, the understanding. 


friend, a lover. Thus the old and first fathers of the 
Germans wanted to call God "Déd", a friend, a 
lover, an Oheim, as the Israelites called him Baal, 
that is, a lord, a bridegroom, a husband. But even 
the Greek Theos doesn't sound much different than 
the word "Deud" or "dudish" if you pronounce it 
"Teuds" or "Teudsch". And there is no doubt that 
the Latin Deus comes from the Greek Theos, 
whether they want to pronounce the The by D soft 
or hard (Raphessare sive Daggessare). For some 
make the t soft by th, others by d. Thus there is a 
great communality (symbolism) between these 
hard, aspirated and soft letters. 

Hence comes the diminutive name "Déodle", 
which the Welsh call Totila, but among the 
Germans "Detzel, Ditzel, Dé6tzel" is quite 
common. For the Welsh change tz into tt, as from 
Hesse they make Hattia, the Hessians call them 
Hatti or Chatti. There is no doubt that the king, 
who is called Detzel in the common language, is 
that Tottila. For the Welsh do not write "Dezel", 
but "Dottel" or Totila. And it is, as he said in jest, 
but still with truth: The Welsh and the French 
write differently than they speak, and speak 
differently than they mean. Thus they speak here 
with the mouth "D6tzel", and yet they write 
Tottila. They speak "Etzel" and write Attila. They 
speak atzio and write actio. They speak lesere, 
asere, disere and write legere, agere, dicere. But 
also our Franks call still today "D6d" a godfather 
or spiritual father, who lifted a child from the 
baptism. 

Therefore this "Didrich" or "Dudrich" is so 
much as rich in GOtt, Divus, Divinus. And in 
Greek Theios or Eusebius, (Latin) Pius. 


The names ending in wick andich are German, 
as: 
Vitigis is called a king of the Longobards, but his 
correct name is "Witich". This one is called 
Divitiacus by Caesar. "Witte" is however in the 


The queen Heddewigis (Hedwig) is more 
correctly called "Hettowig", the father's refuge. 
Because "Wick" means with the Saxons a refuge; 
therefore "Brynswig" or "Brunswig", as is said 
above. So also "Oswig, Coswig, Herdwig." Thus 
one says Lodovicus, but not well; in Saxon it is 
"Lydewig," or "Leutewig" in Swabian, that is, of 
the people or the people's refuge and comfort. 1) 
This one Caesar calls Lytavicus, wanting to 
imitate the Saxon and putting an Italian a instead 
of e, and u instead of a Dutch. The French call him 
in a very clumsy way Clodovaeus, in that the letter 
L is inflated by the throat, and "Wick" 
transformed into vaeus. 


All names ending in walt find German. 


"Oswalt", more correctly "Huswalt", the ruler 
of the house, the head, the steward, who is now 
called "Hoffmeister" at court. For "Walt" means 
force, authority or power to govern. Hence comes 
the word of those who begin something: "Das 
walt GOtt", that GOtt wants to govern. 

"Ehewalt", shortened "Ebald". But it must be 
said "Hegewalt", who has the power or the office 
to guard and to erhallen. Because "hegen" means 
to guard. Hence the name "Heger," 2) which is 
now erroneously called Hoyer, that is, a preserver, 
a guardian, Latin Servatius, at court: 
"chamberlain, rentmaster. Thus one says of a 
field, a meadow, a grove, which is surrounded 
with fences, it is "hegt", namely because it is 
separated from the public use and guarded. And 
the consistory, the court or the sacred circle (Sacer 


circulus, as Homer speaks) is called "cherished 
bench, cherished court" 2c. 


"Sebald", Sebaldus, that is "Seewalt", the first 
syllable pronounced long, is the antithesis in 
relation to "Hegwalt", so that "Seewalt" is such a 
steward, who carries outward, sows, plants, tills, 
the land, 


1) Compare St. Louis edition, vol. V, 


715, s 47.

732

the field, the garden cultivated, and the like; "Hegwalt" 
the one who receives what has been gathered, 
mown, picked, brings it home, keeps it and protects 
it. The latter would be called a husbandman 


(Agricola, in Greek Georgius), the latter an issuer 
(promum). 


"Wilibald", Bilibald, more correctly "Vilewalt", that 
is, who is superior to many things, governs many 
things, as it were as the highest or supreme ruler over 
the others. For "Vel", 1) long spoken, means in 


Saxon: much. Or it comes from good ((a bonitate), 
"Wolwalt", who rules well, called so for the sake of the 
good prefix (as the Germans very often use to do). 


"Tipold", Theobaldiis, but it should be "Ditwald", 


with a Greek Ita: 2) Dit (as above). [Diet] means a 
house, a possession. "Dietwald" is a superior of a 
dominion; or "Dentwalt", "Didwalt", GOttes Gewalt, 
as above in "Dietrich". 


Grymoaldus, a king of the Longobards. 
"Grimwalt", the power of wrath. Among the ancients it 
seems to have been a name for the judicial power, 
which is to exercise wrath against the wrongdoers, as 
now a judge is, who hands over the one to be 
punished to the tormentor. For the fact that nowadays 
one says "judge", "magistrate", is obviously 
something new, since "judge" actually stands in a 
good sense, does not express punishment, but as it 
were promotes and disentangles hindered and 
confused things. And it is actually an activity of the 
mind. Hence we say "right," "rightly," as, a right line, 
a right way, in contrast to a crooked line, a winding 
way. "To make niece" is therefore to make right. 
Hence we call "report" to instruct, instruct, instruct a 
man, to lead out of error: "Dear, report me of this" 2c. 
Therefore, "Grymwalt" is the force of wrath, and the 
Welsh change the w to o, deceived by the sound of 
the words. 


Adoaldus, a king of the Longobards. The name 


comes from Otto or Hatto, "Hettwalt", the father's 
power, in the place of the 


1) In our original erroneously: Vs! instead of: Vel. 
2) Ita, that is 6ta Luther pronounced the same after Jtacism, as the 
Modern Greeks do. 


Father, a guardian, a protector. And today for the 


advocates the name "lawyer", patronus, has 
remained in custom. Whether it is written and read in 
a corrupt way n instead of tt, that one says now 
"lawyer" instead of "Hattwalt", | do not know for sure. 


Rodoaldus, a king of the Longobards. This comes 
either from "council", 3) as above Rodol- phus, 
"Ratwalt", power of the council, power to advise, 
Rathsherr (consul), or from "save", that is, salvare, 
deliver. "Rottwald", a redeemer, liberator, savior, as 
another king of the Longobards is called Rotharis, 


which is no doubt "savior", that is, liberator, 
redeemer. 

Garibaldus, "Gerwalt", "Garwalt", nowadays: 
“authority”. 


All names ending in win, find German. 
"Volckwin", "Volggewin", conqueror of nations, in 
Greek Nicolaus, Nicodemus. 


"Baldwin", Balduwinus, who is quick to conquer. 
Isa. 8, 1.: Raubebald. 


Albuinus, Alguinus, Alcuvinus, Alboinus, 
"Allewin", "Allgewin", who conquers all, a king of the 
Longobards. 


Andonius. If according to the Italian way n is 
written instead of |, it is the same as Alboinus. For 


they write Bononia while they speak Bolonga. 
Otherwise it is "Handwin", which is a victorious hand 
and the right invincible in war. 

"Goswin" seems to be the same as "Huswin", the 
overcomer of houses, in that instead of H, G is put 
incorrectly, as it very often happens. But better it is 
Josquin. This name was made famous by an 
outstanding musician in Dutch. 4) But Josquin is the 
diminutive of Jost or Justus. For this is how those 
people speak to the children in a flattering manner: 


"Justkin," that is, Justulus, Justinulus. For that some 
say "Jobst" is a coarse pronunciation of upper 
Germany. They also call the idol and the idolatrous 
image, which comes from England, Sanct "Jos".

Leupold, this should actually be "Liebhold", as a 
compound name like "Ratthilf" 2c. As if you said, 
"lied und hold", liebenswerth und geliebt, [Greek) 
Erasmus, [Latin] Amandus. For dear is as much as 
beloved or lovable. "Huld" is the favor with which | 
love. Hence one says, "holder Bule," 1) that is, dear 
bride or friend. "He is not dear to me," that is, he does 
not love me. 

"Diepold." Some make Theobaldus out of it, others 
Hypolitus. But Theobaldus is not valid, in any 


language, and it is certainly a fiction. If itis Hypolitus, 
then H can be changed in D, and then the name is 
not a German one, but a Greek one, as there are 
many of them in Germany. | hold that it is the same 
as "Liebold," and that this name is corrupted by an 
inability to pronounce the L correctly (labdakismo), 
because all who suffer from labdakism speak a d in 
the beginning of the syllable [instead of |] and almost 
also ann, while they nevertheless pronounce the | 
correctly at the end of the syllable. It is the same with 
the letter r, that they cannot begin a syllable with r 
and yet they can pronounce the r at the end well. 


All names ending in man, mund are German. 

"Herman," said above, which the Welsh corruptly 
pronounce Arminius, is so much as a leader of the 
army or a warrior. 

"Hartman," a strong man, [Greek] Andrew. For 
"Hart" means a firm, strong, unconquerable, in a 
suffering way (passive), who does not give way, but 
stands firm. 

But "Man" is a word that can be used in the 
German language as often for compounds as any 
other. 


1) In the original: "Holderbule". 





in the Greek and Latin languages. Thus one says: 
"househusband, husband, village man, sword man." 
And in general, as often as a nomen verbale is 
lacking, "man" is compounded with the verbum, as: 

"Siegeman" 2) (whom one calls quite corruptly Si- 
gismundus), as if one said: viotor, a victorious man, 
Victorinus. For "victory" is Victoria, "to win" means 
vincere. 

Bohemundus, "Wogeman", that is, a bold one, 
Audentius, who dares to attack a thing vigorously. 
For it is certainly a mistake of the scribes in Bohe, 
while they heard "Woge". 

Raymundus is said by the very same error for 
"Rygeman" or "Rugeman", which is Quietus, a quiet, 


calm man. In Hebrew: Noah; as Numa Pompilius, 
Solomon were without wars 2c. 


All names ending in werd are German. 

"Albrecht" is certainly "Adelwerd", in a suitable 
composition, as it were "Eddel und werd", precious 
and dear, as we call the gems "Eddelstein", that is, 
delicious stones. "Werd" is theuer and kostbar, and it 
seems this composition of two words of the same 
meaning has a_ special emphasis. "Albrecht, 
Alprecht" are corrupted names. 

Hildebertus, "Heltwerd", 3) that is, a theurer und 
késtlicher oder seltener Held, or "hold und werd", 
Holdwerdus, nowadays one says "holdselig”. 


Digobertus, "Tugewerd". "To lie" is: to be of value, 
to be worth something, to be useful; hence "Tigent”, 
virtus, bravery, honorable deed. Thus one says: "He 
did me all virtue and honor," that is, he did me all 
good deeds and service. 


Fulbertus, that is, "Wolwerd", Wolwerdus, in the 
same emphatic composition: digne dignus, chare 
charus. 

Aripertus, a king of the Lombards, that is, 
"Ehrewerd", honored and theuer, worthy of honor, 
Honorius. 

"Liebenwerd," that is, "lieb und werd," as in

"Liebhold, Rathulf, Hatthulf" in German composition. 
"Werd", that is, theuer, hence the names of the 
towns "Dunawerd" [Donauwerth] and "Werd" [Worth]. 
It is also used in the feminine: "Wolwerd"; 
"Walprecht, Walpurg” is quite corrupted. [Greek] 


Eucharia, [Latin] Gratiosa, Venus, Venusta. 


Gunibertus is a corrupt name, but it means 
something very good. For it is "KUnewerd", that is, 
bold or strong and at the same time worthy, who is 
outwardly strong and worthy of Hanse, and who 
thrives in war and in peace. And it is "Ktin" (long 
spoken and with a Dutch u) and 1) "Werd" with each 
other connected so much as strong and werth. 


Humbertus, that is, "Unwerd", not theuer. There is 
a noble lineage of this name, and it seems as if one 
took this name out of humility, as if one wanted to 
say: Do not strive for high things. It is better to be 
despised in a low place than to want to appear worthy 
through tragic honor. And perhaps Kunibertus is the 
same, in that according to the Dutch way K and H 2) 
are interchanged with each other. 

Sigisbertus, that is, "Siegwerd", that is, you shall 
be victor and at the same time werth. Because the 
victory makes impudent people, but the kindness of 
the victor makes a Siegwerd. 

"Symprecht," Symphorianus. Oh, how many and 
arbitrary corruptions we encounter, since it is the 
same as "Siegebert", putting m for g. 

Lampertus, that is, "lange und werd", which is 
long worth, because the benefits are quickly 
consigned to oblivion, and rarely, or rather never, is 
a Langewerd found, which is long pleasant. 

Robertus, "Ruprecht", both are corrupted. But it 
must be called "Ratwerd", since he is supposed to be 
"Rat und werd", who is able and worth something 
through counsel, just as "Tugewerd" is able and 
worth something through action. For good counselors 
rarely remain valuable, that is, in truth "Ratwerdi".

All names ending in rat are German. 
"Council" with t is ambiguous. First, used only as 
singular, it means a council, for one does not say "the 


council" in the plural, consilia. Hence comes 
Rathaus, 3) "Ratherrn," the council building, the 
seuators, the place where the senate meets. Second, 
it means the councilors themselves, hence in the 
plural "the council" with an Italian a or a double- 
sounding e [which is a]. Third, it denotes a success, 
a well-being, when the syllable "ge" is added 4). 
Hence, "advised, unadvised, wolgeraten." But it is 
clear that this is derived from "advice". There is also 
a word "wheel" with d, in the plural "wheels", namely 


rota, rotae, but this does not belong here. Thus one 
says therefore: 

"Gebhard", more properly "Gebrat", with pure e, 
one capable of giving counsel, a counselor. 

"Volratt", "Wolrat", who probably gives advice, 
who has good advice, Eubulus. But if you want, you 
can say: "Wolrat", that is, "Wolgerat", Fortunatus, 
Felix, Prosper, but | don't like that. 


Conrat, "Kinrat", with sharp emphasis on the first 
syllable and a Dutch u, who is able to do something 


with Rath, who knows Rath, Prudens, Prudentius. 
This name is also shortened and is then called: "Kurt, 
Kuntz, KUntzlin, Kuntzel". In these, the letter u 
indicates that one should also say: "Kunrat", with u 
and not with o. "Kiinnen" is to know or to be strong in 
knowledge. 

Burckardus, "Burgrat", the council of a castle, a 
city. For the cities were called "castle" and the 


inhabitants Burgenses and still today "citizens". 
"Eberhard", more correctly "Ober-Rat", 


highest council, proconsul. 


Ricardus, Ricardis, "Reichrat, Ricrat", or, from 
wealth, as it were a rich council, or more correctly: 
"Rekrat", council among the giants, the noble, the 
heroes, because "Recke" means the noble, great, 
heroes, strong men, giants. Such a one seems to be 
called "war council" nowadays.

Oldradus is clear in itself that it is "Altrat", or in Saxon 
"Oltrat", an old councilor or the senate, and he is 
perhaps called so in contrast to youthful councilors who 
overthrow the communities by their inexperience and 
foolishness. Otherwise, nowadays, "old council, new 
council" is the name given to those who succeed each 
other by annual change in the office of authority. 


Eckhardus, "Eckart", but according to my opinion 
"Hegerat" from "hegen", as above, the one who keeps, 
who guards wisely and carefully. And he who is called 


Odoacer by the Welsh is "Hettheger". Because "Ott" or 
"Od", as we said, is Hatto, Hetto, so "Hettheger" is the 
guarding father, who preserves, protects. Therefore 
"Eck", "Wolfs-Eck" 1) should more correctly be "Hege" 


Hegio, "Hilfshege", the preservation of the help or the 
help of the preservation. Or if you want "council" to be 
said of belongings (Fortuna), then "Hege-council" will be 
the one who preserves what has been acquired. For 
"Rat" and "Unrat" are said in German when the goods 
are taken care of well or badly, since thereby, as it were, 
good or bad care is taken of the household. But the 
former derivation is better. 


Marquardus is exceedingly coarse instead of 
"Margratt" or "Marcratt" (Markrath], a rath of the land. 


"Marck" means boundaries. Therefore, this Margratus 
presides over a certain area, which is determined in its 
boundaries. 


The names ending in hart are German. 


Namely, "hard" means strength, "firm, strong". 
1. "Volckhart," the strength, support, bearer of the 


people, [Greek] Demosthenes. 

2. "Leenhart", lion strength, who acts there manly and 
fearlessly. Thus Duke Henry of Brunswick the Lion has 
been called 2c. 

3. "Bernhart", bear strength. 

4. "Ehrhart", strength of honor or honorable strength, 
which protects there masculine respectability. 

5) "Degenhartz", strength of virtue, namely, he who is 
steadfast and firm in virtue, who does not allow himself 
to be swayed or bribed. For 


1) In our template: "Eckwolffs Eck". 
2) Compare Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. XIX, 975, on the word 
"Unrath. 


"Degen" comes from "Diigen", to apply, to be fit, as one 
says in Saxon: "Er thet my alle Ehre und Digent", that 
is, all kinds of good (virtutis) and services he has done 
me. Because that's where "Digent" comes from, with a 


Greek y (otherwise "Tugent"), Virtutes. This is the 
XxxxxXx,” ) which Cicero 


in Latin officium. 

"Reinhart", maybe "Nugenhart", peace strength, or 
"Regenhart". 

"Gotthart," God strength, [Hebrew] Gabriel, if you 
don't want to derive it from "kind," which means 
ingenium or nature. "Gotthart" would then be "Guttart”, 
bono ingenio, "Gutter nature, pious", in Greek 


Agathais, Agatha, 

Thus, one could also say "Reinart" is of a pure, chaste 
kind, (Greek] Catharus, Catherin. 

"Hoard" is used substantively and comes from the 
adjective hard; it means firmness. Thus we call God "our 
stronghold," where the Hebrew calls Him a rock. From 
there comes "hortig", from good and solid health, 
healthy, lively. 


Several more names. 


From is said above, it is "Détzel" or "Detzel" from the 
word "Déd" with the double sound 6. Because so the 
Franconians say: "My Déd." But "Déd" or "Deud" is the 
name of GOD, as is said above. Therefore Tottila is 


"Dédle", "Dédtzel", as it were a small God or Deunculus, 
"G6ttlin". As the tt is changed into a double s 4) or z, or 
the Hebrew (for it must be "Gdttlin", or lesser gods, 


under the true GOtte) 5) the historians call him Taxillo 


or Tassillo, with even coarse guttural sound. 
The same has happened with the name, which must 


rather be pronounced Hettila or "Héttle", and with one 
it becomes "Hotzle", "Hétzel". For it is a diminutive of 
Hatto or Hetto and Hotta; these names are pronounced 
with omission of the aspi-

ration "Otto" and, derived from it, "Oettle", and are still 
very common today. From it also the royal city in 


Hungary Buda or "Oven" is geuanut in German 


"Hetzelsburg”, arx Attilae or Hettilae, because 
Hettila, the king of the Huns, had his royal seat there. 
But it is Hattela Vaterchen, little father, in German 
"Vaterlin". 

Carolus or Karolus is without doubt the Saxon 
"Kerle" with double sound e, which those always 
make into an Italian a. But "Kerle" is a man of tall 
stature and large body, as it is written that Carl was 
the first. 

Alphonsus, Alfonsus is very close to the German 
"Hels uns", if it is not this itself. It means: our help. 
For (as | said) the Welsh leave out the aspirations 
and make a out of e. 

Arionistus (so Caesar has it), other worse 


Ariouistus with u, is "Ehrnvest" and is shortened 
"Ehrnst". But "Ehrnvest" is nowadays a title of the 
nobility, especially of the knights, because they hold 
on to respectability and should hold on. Because that 
is what the word means. 

Marobodus, so the Latin have it, but the Germans 
"Mehrervod", shortened "Mehrvod", long spoken, 
however the roughly speaking people 
Oberdeutschlauds it verderbeu in "Vogt". But it is 
"Mehrer" 1) Major. Therefore one calls still now St. 
Jacob the Greater "St. Jacob the More". And 


Moravia we call today "Mehreu", which got this name 
from this Marobodus, that is from "Mehrervod". But 


"Vod" comes from "soil", that is, to nurture, to nourish, 
to raise, as parents nourish their children, and 


animals their young. Therefore Marobodus is "the 
Mehrervod", that is, the greater, upper, higher 
nourisher, who is above the lower Vodis. For so the 
princes are said to be Vodi, Hetti, Dodi, "Hettlin, 
Détzlin", nourishers, fathers, shepherds, gods of the 
peoples. Therefore also another country is called 
"Vodland", now corrupted "Voitland"” or "Vogtland", 
perhaps because this country should be 


administered only by One Vodus. 
There is a proper name Bodo, which is just

second following paragraph.

741 


This "vod" is a caretaker, a shepherd, a breadwinner. 
It is not properly pronounced "messenger", because 
this means one who brings news. 

Marscbalcus. No Naine is more shamefully 
corrupted by the Guelphs or bad scribes. For it is also 
that which is called "Mehrer" or Major, and 
"Stallherr", and is called a master of the horsemen 
thereof, that he has to govern the horsemen. And one 
should have spoken and written "Mehrstallherr", that 
is, the greater, upper, highest Rittmeister. This is 
nowadays the title of the Duke and Churfirst of 
Saxony. And if this word had not been corrupted, it 
would not have been necessary to add now, 
"Ertzmarschalck", but "Mehrstallherr" would have 
expressed what "Ertz" or Archi means, since it 
denotes the highest master of the cavalry. 


Lotharius. calls him Lutherius or 


Lutherus. It is "Luther" still today a common name in 
Germany, especially in Saxony. But it means a lord 
or ruler of the people. For "Lide" means (as | have 
said) in Saxon people; "Her" 2) Herum or dominum. 
But Caesar, as | have said above, is wont to change 
d into t, if it be not for the sake of the following 
aspiration, or for other causes. Therefore, also here 


Caesar 


is a Dutch u or a Pythagorean y. Then th is the tender 
and soft d. Finally, the Saxons to this day call that 
very good emperor Lotharius "Keyser Lydher" or 
"Ludher". If a Swabian heard this pronounced, he 
would make it "Lidher", because they like to make a 
Latin i out of the Greek /. But Caesar, since he 
actually wanted to make "“Ludherum" by the 
aspiration, was the cause that the coarse talkers 
afterwards made Lotharius out of it. And nowadays 
one makes "Litter", "Lotter" and the like. Hence 
comes Lotharingia, "Ludheringen", that is Ludher's 
dwelling, from the grandson of Carl the Great, who is 
called Lotharius by the historians. Now one says 
quite roughly "Lottringen".

rules the plow, so that it is in the day that the Franks 
were manly people or a young crew, who, for 
example, since they were servants, have set 
themselves free through war in an uprising. "The free

Franciscus is in Greek imitation the diminutive,

3, Luther's Dialectics or the Theological Use of Logic, displayed by him. *) 


About 1540. 


The rational art of Melanchthon contains all the 
necessary precepts (or teachings), so to be found in 
Aristotle, Rodolphus and Petrus Hispanus. But 
Philippus has explained the teachings with beautiful 
examples, and has reported our lines of the right use 
of the art of reasoning. But | will put them in my books 
in one and another doctrine, if | live. 

For the whole reason consists in the division, 
definition (exact description) and way to conclude. 
The division indicates that one does not need the 
word in an ambiguous way; e.g., if | were to speak of 
faith, | would use the abbreviation "faith". 


division: It is a historical faith, which the devils also 
have; a worldly (civil) faith in words and works, which 
is remembered in the reckoning of the fruits of the 
Spirit, Gal. 5:22, and a Christian, true, unfeigned, 
living and righteous faith. 

If | were to judge about marriage, | would have to 
leave the difference in advance. For there is a 
double, namely a_ half-started (or vowed), and 
consummated marriage. 

The definition (or exact description) indicates 
what the thing is that is being talked about. But the 
things to be described are double: 





*This writing is found only in Walch. He reports about it in his preface to the 14th volume, p. 84 f., that v. L6scher from a manuscript, 
which may have been written around 1540, and according to which Luther was so copied, this dialecticam or rather usum logices 
theologicum, ab illo demonstratum of a preface, which he put to LI. Wolfgang Gottlob Fértschel's biblical Lexicon Luthers, which was 
published in 1726. The translator August Tittel gave this writing the title: "Vernunftkunst mit Gott. V. |. M. Die Lehrart der Vernunft- oder 
SchluBkunst, so der Ehrwirdige Herr D. Luther gelehrt", for which we have put the above title after the Latin. 


744 


Luther's theological use of logic. W. xiv, 1309-1312. 


745 





An independent thing, or the accidental thing. 

The independent thing is a body according to 
Aristotle, or a thing according to Donatus. 

Substantials are of two kinds: incorporeal and 
corporeal. For with this common division we are 
satisfied here. 

The incorporeal ones are either uncreated or 
created. Uncreated, incorporeal beings are God the 
Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit. Since no 
one has seen God, and He is revealed to us in the 
Word of the Son, the exact and proper descriptions of 
the essence and will of God, of the difference 
between the persons, must be badly taken from the 
written Word of God and the testimonies of the 
Church of all times and spoken according to it. 

The created incorporeal substantial are the good 
and bad angels and spirits of the people. For actual 
descriptions one must take also from the holy 
scripture. 

The corporeal substantial (beings) are partly 
rational, like man; partly unreasonable. Of these, 
some have living and moving bodies, others do not 
move. 

The actual description of man is also to be taken 
from Scripture; but of the other animals and creatures 
of God and of all instruments, it is taken from the 
working causes, which partly fall into the senses, and 
partly are found out by man's reason in diligent 
research. For what has only one being (Il am speaking 
of bodies that can be seen and grasped) is made of 
something else: and this 1) is called matter, which is 
twofold, either raw or made with art. The latter can be 
seen, so the eyes can judge such visible and tangible 
matter. 

Even if a raw matter has its forms or shapes, like 
the metals, of which the philosopher speaks, and the 
unadjusted stones and woods, art and chance give 
new forms to a raw matter. Therefore 

The form of two things. The natural, as it is created 
or grows naturally, and the artificial. 


1) In the old edition: the. 





In the same way, the forms are either external, as 
the quantities (magnitudes and numbers), or the 


qualities; but some are internal, as the habitus (or 
habitual skills), which the teachers of reason also call 


differentias specificas (essential differences or 
qualities). 

The form is therefore the quantity of the body, or 
inner or outer quality. It gives the thing the essence 
that is, does not make matter, but makes the thing 
essentially different. 

All forms, however, have the name in view of and 


because of (respective) an existing matter and the 
creator (or imager), so the acting cause is called. 
What the teachers of nature and reason teach about 
the difference between the main causes, a student 
must learn diligently. For this knowledge serves to 
make out the greatest tragedies. 

What something does or makes, however, aims at 
a final purpose. The thing or effect that is produced 
follows the action. 

But what has only the being (I speak of bodies), 
that is in a place and in the time. Therefore, the 


ancients added ubi (where) and quando (when) to the 
predicaments. 

And everything that is there, when it is compared 
with each other, has an inequality. Thus the (exact) 
descriptions often arise from equalities and 
inequalities, especially of unknown things, which are 
often used by those who describe herbs and animals. 
These are not so far above the common mind that 
even laymen (or common people), if they are told 
about them, can judge them well. 

Thus, the (actual) best descriptions arise from the 
main causes. They go straight to, says D. Luther, 2) 
and report one correctly, and one comes to it sooner 


and closer than by praedicabilia and praedicamenta, 


which, to speak actually, take everything from causis 
(or main causes), how many names are attached to 
things from the main causes, and the teachers of 
oratory take all their figures of speech and extensions 
of words from the 


2) If this writing is otherwise by Luther, then this is to be regarded 
as an insertion of the scribe. 


746 


Luther's historical and philological writings. W. xiv, 1312-1315. 


747 





The first thing that Melanchthon showed us was the 
"main cause". The same has erroneously taken place 


in the art of speech and speech forms (schematibus). 

Let us give one and another example. The 
farmers speak: What is this thing? What is it made of? 
What is the matter? How is it made? This is the form. 
Where does it come from? That is the acting main 
cause. With what is it made? That is the tool cause. 
What does it serve? What is its use? is the final cause. 
When it comes into the work and has reached its end, 


it is effectus (or effect), e.g. man. 

But here one must make a difference, Another is 
man before the fall; another after the fall. Another is 
born again of water and the Spirit, and who lives in faith 
in this mortal body. Another in the resurrection, when 
he bears the image of the transfigured body of the Son 
of God, all holy and immortal and glorious. The man, 
the Son of God, walking in the holy, yet mortal flesh, is 
also a different man, not only because the human 
nature is guided by the divine, but also because he is 
completely holy, without disorder, yet subject to human 
characteristics, yet without sin, misery and death. 


But let's look at the whole Adam according to the 
main causes. 


Adam is a creature of the Holy Trinity, created 
from an earthly lump, in the image of God, wise, just, 
immortal, although he should live in the animate life 
until the transformation, that he should praise God the 
Creator, beget children and live with God in eternal joy. 
The earth lump is the matter. The image of God, so a 
piece of the Godhead is, is the essential form. 
Because of the quantity (size) and qualities, parts we 
have thought nothing here. The creating Trinity is the 
acting cause. The final purpose, that he praises God 
always. The place can also be added: created in 


paradise; likewise the time (quando), on the sixth day 


after creation of the world. The likeness: equal (or 
similar) to God according to the soul or spirit, and the 


good angels, except that he was created from earth. 

If one now wants to describe the fall correctly, he 
looks completely different than before. However, 
since he is redeemed and sanctified and restored, he 
is far better than the innocent Adam before the fall. 


For he will no longer lead an animated or natural 


(animatum) life, but a spiritual one in a spiritual body 
and soul, which will no longer fall. 


I add another common example. 


A pewter jug. The matter is pewter; that it stands, 
is hollow, is overheated, has a lid and a handle, these 
are essential pieces or shapes. The pewter caster is 
the active cause. The artist's form and tools are the 
work-centred cause. The final purpose is for the artist 
who wants to sell it to preserve himself and his own; 
but for the buyer to use it, as a tool, for the necessary 
use of the family and for ornamentation. 2c. The 
matter and form are visible; of the main cause and 
end purpose, people can say orally, or one 
investigates it naturally from the nature of 


relativorum (or things that belong together, or relate 
to something else). If an unknown jar is actually to be 
described, then one describes the equality first, and 
does it approximately after the quantity (size). 

In the art of Arzue there are descriptions of the 
bodies. The lawyer (or jurist) talks about the right to 
the bodies and the right of the border. So one takes 
the descriptions from the relations, from what for 
command (or force) the border is set, where and 
why? 


Now I will give an example of random things. 


Namely, of something that you can neither see nor 
grasp, but merely have in your thoughts. 

Such accidental things, let them be quantities or 
qualities, are attached to their essential things 


(subjectis), which the teachers of reason call materia 
in qua (or matter thereon), and have with their 
objectis or correlativis 


748 


Luther's theological use of logic. W. xiv, 1315-1317. 


749 





which are called materia circa quam (or matter 
around which). For the accidental things have no 


matter "out of which" (or €X qua), because they have 
no bodies. 

Whoever wants to talk about faith, for example, 
must first explain the ambiguous. 

There is a historical, civil, and justifying faith. This 
faith, however, if it is knowledge, applause or 
confidence, is in the time of man, to whom we also 
attribute knowledge and thoughts according to the 
theologians’ teaching. 


The form, or formalia, (essentials) of justifying 
faith are thus, to know, or hasten, firm and certain 
thought, or applause, or confidence. These essentials 
must be taken from clear testimonies of Scripture 
according to proper doctrine: whether something is 
what it is, whether it is the same? 

That a faith fei, no one who is a right member of 
the church will deny. 

What faith is, teaches the Scriptures. And since 
we have spoken of the formalities (or essentials), 
these must be taken from certain passages of 
Scripture. This is what Rodolphus calls: whether it is 
so? But the Son of God John 17 calls faith a 
knowledge, and Isaiah: a certain thought, likewise 
Paul: a true, firm and undoubted confidence, 
joyfulness. 


But since each (accidens) is said to be an 
accidental thing or form of another, or to have a 


necessary essence (subjecto), because accidental 
things in themselves have a wedge-like essence, one 
must, according to the right doctrine, seek the 
independence or subjectum of faith, which is the 
materia in qua: If, according to the right doctrine, 
accidental things in themselves have a distinct 
essence, then one must necessarily seek the 


independence or subjectum of faith, which is the 


materia in qua. And this is man's heart, in which are 
thoughts, scientific reasons (or principles) and 
applause. There faith is found, as Paul says Rom. 10, 
10: "If one believes from the heart, he is justified." 1) 

But he who recognizes recognizes something, and 
he who believes believes something. That is why 
faith, or true thought, is called firm and certain 


confidence, or joy ad aliquid, or aiming at something, 


1) Put by us instead of, "One believes from the heart unto 
righteousness." 





and has an objectum or thing in view, which he 
recognizes or confesses, which he agrees with and 


trusts: this is now called in relatione correlativo- rum 
(in the connection of things belonging together) of 


faith either objectum, or materia circa quam. And this 
is the word of the Gospel, the promise or grace, in 
which God promises us forgiveness of sins and 
eternal life out of pure grace, because of the 
intercession and blood of Christ. For to believe rightly 
is as much as to believe the word, and through the 
apostle's word we believe in Christ. Thus the King had 
the justifying faith, Joh. 4, 50, because man believed 
the word. 

The faith that is thus entangled in the Word 
recognizes from the Word the grace of the Father, the 
blood of Christ, becomes partaker of the Holy Spirit 
and rests on the Word, and as strong and certain as 
the Word is, so strong and certain is also the faith that 
is founded and supported on the Word, although the 
fickleness or weakness of the human heart always 
struggles with the certainty of faith. 


These formalia, and the materia in qua and circa 


quam, make up the actual description of faith, and 
show how the weak faith in our hearts and the firm 
word in our thoughts are to be distinguished, so that 
we do not doubt the certainty of the promise because 
of the smallness and weakness of our faith. 

The working cause. Everything that is, has its 
cause; therefore faith does not arise from itself, or 
from nothing, or from rational thoughts, or 
philosophical musings, but from the preached, 
written, read, heard word of God, with which it always 
has to do. For faith comes from the word or hearing, 
says Paul (Rom. 10, 17.), that is, the working cause 
of faith is the ministry of the Spirit. When ungodly 
people are baptized, taught, absolved, hear about 
Christ, the Holy Spirit, who is present, moves the 
hearts, awakens inexpressible sighs from the 
innermost part of the heart. The hearts begin to 
applaud, to sigh, to delight in such knowledge, and the 
Holy Spirit works. 


2) In the old edition: the. 


750 


Luther's historical and philological writings. W. xiv, 1317-1320.' 751 





Spirit not on stones but on people 2c. 

Just as faith is born of the Word, the Spirit and the 
sacraments, so it is nourished and sustained by 
meditation and diligence in the Word, godly sighs, and 
the right use of the sacraments. The Spirit helps our 
weakness, and the right spirit is given to the one who 
prays, and he who has, receives; as we see in the 
prodigal son, Luc. 15. 

The final cause (final purpose). But what works also 
works to a certain end. So the end of faith is that we 
here, through faith, receive forgiveness of sins, 
reconciliation, imputed righteousness, the firstfruits of 
the Holy Spirit, so that in the knowledge of the Father's 
mercy, which shines and is seen in the blood of the 
Mediator, a new life, light and joy are kindled in the 
believer, and transfigures us into the image of the Son 
of God from one clarity to another, and restores in us the 
wisdom, righteousness and glory of God that we lost in 
Adam, and kills the sins in and 1) and gives us comfort 
in fear, and overcomes the horror and feeling of both 
deaths in us, so that we gently depart from this world to 
eternal life. 

This final purpose of faith will take effect when we are 
brought out of the graves and placed at the right hand of 
God, that we may resemble the Son of God, our brother, 
in sanctified and perfected wisdom, righteousness, joy, 
honor and immortality, as. Peter says (1. Ep. 1, 9.). The 
end of faith is eternal life, which we have here in hope, 
but there in the thing itself, when we will be like the Son 
of God. This is the doctrinal way of dealing with a simple 
sentence. 

One also adds comparisons and examples, so that 
everything becomes clearer; e.g. when one speaks of 
the great and wonderful faith of Abraham, the centurion, 
and the Cananaean woman; but the small and weak one 
of the apostles, the royal, the father in Marco. For from 
accidental 


1) In the old edition: "ins" instead of: in us. 





One prefers to speak of things in concreto (or of 


persons) rather than in abstracto or badly (or in mere 
thoughts and imagination), since one deals only with 
ideas or separated concepts. 


Let us give another example of marriage. 


Scholars distinguish between a marriage that has 
been solemnized (or vowed), when a promise is made 
for the future or the present, and a marriage that has 
been consummated, when a wedding is solemnized with 
public ceremonies. 

If one now wants to describe the marriage correctly, 
he thinks first of the common kind under the 


praedicabilibus. 


The common type (ZenuS) of marriage is the right. 
The right is a right order or establishment. Therefore it 
belongs to justice. Righteousness is a virtue or 
something honorable that coincides with the word of 
God, or reason, or the expressed (written) laws. Virtue 


is an inherent skill (habitus) of the mind. This habitus 
is a quality in the predicaments. The qualities, if they are 
considered according to their main causes, are forms 
(shapes). They are accidental things. Whether the right 
in itself is an order of God or something good, so we act, 


when we speak of marriage, not in abstracto, but of the 
right to marriage in a person. 

But now we want to go through this simple sentence 
or matter according to all main causes. Wise people 
count it (the marriage) for certain causes to the 


praedicamento relationis. Others have" certain 
questions of doctrine. But different people talk about the 
same thing in different ways, all of which are in 
agreement and aim at one purpose and end, both the 
teachers of reason and of oratory; only that the first draw 
mere lines, but the last add colorful colors and 
secondary things. 

Whether a marriage is, one must know from the word 
of God, reason and the laws. 

What it is, give the main causes, which we also bring 
out according to the word of God, the natural law, the 
moral art and the prescribed law, according to certain 
doctrine and by reflection. 


752 


When you think of random things, the first thing 
you think of is form. 

Then the formal cause of marriage is a lawful, 
indissoluble union. These words must be made 
according to the words of Scripture, according to the 
nature of the causes and godly examples in which the 
form of a right marriage is presented. In Genesis 2, 
the words are clear about the form of marriage, so in 
Genesis 24 in the history of Rebecca, and in the legal 
scholars likewise. This union is then legal if it is done 
with the consent of the bridegroom and the bride, and 
the consent of the parents according to God's and the 
emperor's law; likewise with the public testimony of 
those who were present at the transaction; likewise 
with what words, signs and pledges the consent has 
been indicated; likewise with what ceremonies the 
union or marriage has been performed and 
completed. There will be a heap of matter to talk 
about, if one describes this part of the exact 
description, namely the form, and _ confirms 
everything finely, as is reasonable, with laws and 
examples. 

For the question: if and what it is? is followed by 
the question: if it is that? For one must not merely say 
and state a thing, but also prove and affirm it. 

But since the union is among several, one must 


also ask: What is the subjectum or the matter, in 
which the union takes place. The matter, in which 
there are two persons, a male and a female, is now 
stated and confirmed from the word of God. And this 
matter must be explained with many scholars' 
research, namely, that such two persons must be of 
proper age and health in order to be suitable for 
marriage. For it is said of a perfect man that he is fit 
for marriage. Likewise, that they be free persons, and 
that neither blood friendship nor affinity stand in the 
way, and that blood and public honor be shunned, of 
which godly men teach salutary both among divine 
scholars and legal experts. 

For man and woman are taken in this description 
for such persons who have no defect. 


Luther's theological use of logic. W. xiv, 1320-1322. 





753 


The active cause. For the honor and comfort of 
marriage, the main cause is spoken of, namely, that 
God ordered, blessed, preserved and protected this 
state, in which one also sees that God is chaste. One 
can also see from an honest marriage bed what the 
love of the Son of God is for His bride. For among the 
lesser causes is counted by some the consent by 
which marriage is contracted, if it be lawful. And if it 
has been once according to the laws and 
respectability, then itis a right marriage, although the 
minds and wills among the spouses become divisive 
afterwards. For the union and the right of marriage 
remain inseparable throughout life, unless adultery, 
malicious desertion and death and murder intervene. 
These causes destroy the bond. But otherwise the 
disagreement does not separate the marriage. For as 
that must always be arbitrary, which one once liked, 
so also that over which two persons become properly 
one. This also includes the celebrated betrothal, as 
well as the (priestly) union, which does not make the 
marriage itself, but only confirms and seals it. 

The final causes, as the production of children. But 
whether marriage does not always attain this end, yet 


when the formalia (or essentials) of marriage are null 
and void, it remains wholly valid. For there are also 
other final purposes; for example, that fornication 
may be avoided. Therefore, even against the old 
papal law, marriage cannot be denied to the ancients; 
for marriage is an experience of the law, and a 
consolation of human life, and an ordinance against 
dissolute lusts, or rather evil thoughts 2c. There are 
also other theological ends; for example, that in 
chaste marriage one recognizes a chaste God, and 
calls upon him with a good conscience and a pure 
heart. Likewise, that the secret of the bridegroom, the 
son of God, and his Heziba or church, be known in 
honest marriage and sweetest parental love, as well 
as conjugal affection, among one another. 2c. 

The similarities can be taken from other 
comparisons. The examples of honest and blessed 
marriage are Adam's, Rebecca's, Esther 2c. 
Because the polygamy ge- 


754 


Luther's historical and philological writings. W. xiv, 1822-1325. 


755 








The gospel abolishes both of these, after the first 
institution: "Two shall be one flesh, and inseparably 
united, or, as the emperor says, to an inseparable 
community of life"; and also evil examples, such as 
Lamech's, Esau's, David's, who took another's wife. 
For although one must go by laws and not by 
examples, the addition of examples gives light and 
interpretation to the matter itself. So much for the 
division and correct description of a _ simple 
proposition. 

Now follows the kind of conclusion that belongs to 
the joined sentences or speech, and to the question: 
whether it is? namely, if one is to prove that the 
description concerns the thing described or not. For 
he who asserts something must prove it. The matter 
of the art of conclusion are round (or short) 
descriptions. And the word of God also approves, 
and the laws always include something of a 
description. Or one also concludes from the division, 
or matter, or form, or cause, final purpose or effect, 
affirmative or negative. 


From the form. 

Titius and Bertha are not legally united; therefore, 
there is no marriage between them. The conclusion, 
if it is a hidden superordinate clause (prefix), is a 
piece of the description, which contains the 
formalities or essential pieces. The intention must be 
proved. For the other person has not consented to 
anything, or the parents have not given their yes, or 
otherwise something has gone against other laws or 
princely orders, or against the law of the land; e.g., in 
Meissenlande it is a law that secret betrothal without 
the parents' will is not valid. 


Of Matter. 

The Turks have many wives; therefore, they do 
not have a proper marriage. The conclusion or the 
hidden intention is in the matter, therefore it is valid. 
For the intention is clear. 

Titius has held a public engagement with Bertha, 
therefore he cannot have Rhea. The conclusion is 
correct, because the person must be free and single. 





Mitio is a sixty-year-old man, so his marriage 
between him and his neighbor is not valid. The 
conclusion is wrong. One gives an example: 
Abraham, an old man, and Mithridates of ninety years 
have taken wives. 

This old mother is eighty years old and can no 
longer give birth due to old age, therefore her and 
Mitioni's marriage is legally invalid. The conclusion is 
not valid, because there are more final purposes in 
marriage. 

So much in brief of the matter of conclusions or 
final speeches, which are taken from theology, the 
word of God, law and statutes, principles of nature 
and natural science, and other rules. These 
conclusions then have their right reason and are 
valid. 


The form of the conclusion are: syllogism or 


conclusion speech, and enthymema, short 


conclusion (or siunbehaltung). 


The resolution (major) is a saying or common 
sentence or treatise in general, either a description 


or a piece of description (definitio). 


The subordinate clause is the attribution 


(hypothesis), namely, the treatment of a particular 
kind or of a single thing. This is the case when the 
common account is drawn and interpreted to the 
intended thing or trade, or when something of the 


intended thing (subjecto) is denied. 

The working cause of the final speech or this art is 
God, the author of all good, just, and fairness of the 
arts; likewise of those forms which God has planted 
in the minds, that one may grasp a trade finely round 
about, and report it to the people and keep it. 

The ultimate purpose of the final speech is to 
teach people artificially so that they can hear and 
retain it. But since the true is distinguished from the 
false, he who grasps the true in his mind and judges 
rightly from the basis of a trade will then also easily 
notice the fallacies and false dealings. For then one 
judges only from the contradiction of the matter. For 
all false conclusions are either contradictory or 
lacking in ambiguity or division, or in some main 
cause, or do not conclude the same. 


756

757 





or captivates the opponent with several sentences; 
and often he who has a bad thing speaks confusedly 
and darkly with all diligence. So much for the short art 
of conclusion or reason. 

But | ask you as a friend that you interpret this 
above and in haste scribbled together and briefly 
drafted work 1) for the best. You will soon see the 
usefulness of these things when you use these short 
and childish rules for important things. 

Practice is the best teacher for reasoning and 
speaking. If a case arises, and you refer to a passage 
from Scripture or the laws concerning the intended 
transaction, you will immediately think of the division 
or difference. 

Now if the real meaning of the words is there, then 
make the right description from the Scriptures, or the 
right according to the main causes. 

Then apply them to your case, and see whether it 
agrees with the picture given in the description or not, 
then you will be able to conclude either affirmatively or 
negatively from it, and also to refute what is contrary 
to it. 


Also the causes have great use in the analyi (or 
interpretation, explanation), if one wants to interpret a 
whole book or text, or a whole content, or something 
of it. For first one must think what the matter of the 
book or the saying fei; one must read the whole book 
diligently. Then, if the writing is extensive, one must 
think of the parts, or consider all the words in the text 
according to the doctrine, 2c., then of the things that 
belong to the form, how it is formed? how it is spoken 
of? Likewise, of the main cause, who is the author or 
active cause of it? what drove the author? what kind 
of tool he had? Item, of the final purpose, what he 
intended? what he aimed at? what the book is useful 
for or serves? what one has to learn from it? Likewise 
the circumstances: Where and when the book 


1) If Luther wrote this, then Léscher's assumption that we have to 
do with a postscript falls away. 


What are the times like? because they are, as it were, 
lan interpretation. 

An interpreter, who must be practiced in the art of 
language, must think of this. He must also understand 
ithe languages themselves well, if the book consists of 
many languages. For the mere teacher of language 


(grammaticus) alone judges the actual meaning, 
origin, and force of the words, as well as the correct 
version or combination of the words, and the forms of 
speech in the teachings of God. Whoever wants to 
lexplain the Latin text should go to the basic text. In 
the New Testament, he researches diligently from 
which place of the Old Testament the intended 
passage is taken. In the Old Testament he researches 
where the passage was explained in the New 
‘Testament. He also consults the commentators and 
histories, for there is no book so bad that he does not 
occasionally find something good in it. He looks for the 
true meaning of the Greek words in the Greek 
authors. He holds the Hebrew ones against each 








other, and above all he seeks the kingdom of God in 
the knowledge of his ineptitude and trust in the 
mediator, and asks God, the giver of all wisdom, to 
give him the Holy Spirit, and directs all his studies to 
the praise and glorification of the divine name in 
theology and to the salvation of the churches, and in 
other arts to the preservation of righteousness and 
tranquility, then all things will fall to him, and he will 
often have good ideas from God, and be instructed by 
the Holy Spirit, as He is with the prayerful, who 
ponder, seek God's glory, speak kindly and honestly 
with good friends, and inquire about doubtful things 
with those who possess glorious gifts in the Church. 
For without God's blessing there is nothing good in 
men, which even the pagans confess. 

| will add an example from the 9th chapter [v. 26.] 
of the first book of Moses of the analysi or explanation 
of the Scriptures here. 

There are two kinds of matter in theology, law and 
gospel. 


So let it be this 


1. The first thought of a godly and learned 
interpreter, to see if the passage is about the 
Law or the Gospel? 


758 


"Praise be to the GOD of Shem, and Canaan be his 
1) servant." 


This place is evangelical. For it deals with the 
blessed (or highly praised) Son of God and spiritual 
blessing, and comprehends the person and office of 


Messiah. If one has now the main kind (genus) in 
mind, so think one 


2. to the matter. 


Matter is the thing or objectum (intended thing) 
that the text is about. 

Here the text is about the Son of God, who shall 
become man, and his ministry, and about the lineage, 
from which he shall be born. For Moses also writes of 
me, says Christ, and all the patriarchs and prophets 
were called directly by the Son of God, and have seen 
the Son of God in the Spirit, and have testified of the 
Messiah 2c. Noah is a patriarch, a high bishop of his 
time, directly called by the Son of God 2c. Likewise 
Moses describes almost in all histories of the 
patriarchs their creed or doctrine. Accordingly, Noah 
also preaches in his last words or testament about 
the Son of God and summarizes the summa of his 


teaching, his symbolum. 
The language or letter art has to create here also. 
Because the name Shem can be understood by all 


casus Of Christo. "Praised be the GOtt Shem!" or, 
from Shem the son of GOtt is to be praised. Or: GOd 
will bless Shem, that is, in the line of Shem the Son 
of GOd will distribute his spiritual blessing, and will 
spring from his descendants. Or: O Shem! the Lord 
God, the Son of God, whose father you will be 
according to the flesh, will be blessed, to be praised, 
to be glorified, because he will be full of spiritual 
blessings, grace and truth. He will restore us to grace, 
will give that we may become pleasant, and will bring 
forth again the doctrine of truth, and make us, who 
are by nature lying, true, upright, and right, because 
we shall bear his image 2c. | come back to our 


1) In the old edition: their. 


Luther's historical and philological writings. W. nv, 1327-1330. 





759 





"Praise be to the Lord GOtt Sem!" 


For as Christ is called David, because he is 
David's seed, so he is called Shem, because he was 
to be born of Shem. For the children bear the names 
of the parents. "Praised be the GOt Shem!" or the 
GOt of Shem and the GOt of David. The LORD will 
be blessed, praised, or will be preached and called 
upon in the whole world; he, the given birth of the 
virgin's womb, full of grace and truth, who will bless 
all who believe in him. These are the materials, or 
this is the opinion of Christo, who is to spring from 
Shem's family. 

But here many pieces come together. The father 
prophesies to Noah that the mediator will spring from 
Shem, the middle son, or that Shem will be the father 
of the promised seed. At this revelation he becomes 
joyful in spirit, who was very sad because of the flood 
of sin and because of the fall, and because of the sin 
of the son, and because of the curse of the godless 
world; therefore he breaks out into a joyful voice, like 
Zacharias and Mary, like Paul in the epistle to the 
Ephesians: "Praise be to the Almighty God, who will 
fulfill his promise as a true God, and will cause his 
son to be born from my son's loins" 2c. One can 
remember here the joy of Noah, who saw this, knew 
this, saw the day of the Son of God, like Abraham, 
and certainly believed and desired to see Christ in 
the flesh, as Christ speaks of the eager desire. This 
is the prophecy of the lineage of Christ. 

In addition, there are also other prophecies and 
teachings of Christ. For as Noah spoke in the 
foregoing words of the conclusion or statute of wrath, 
which the Son of God brought forth out of the counsel 
of the Trinity immediately after the fall against the 
serpent and his seed, so he testifies in these words 
of the other part, namely, of the conclusion or statute 
of grace, which the Son of God also brought forth out 
of the bosom of the Father in Paradise, when he 
refreshed and calmed the fallen Adam with this most 
consoling voice: "The seed of the woman shall bruise 
the serpent's head." It contains 


760 


Luther's theological use of logic. W. xiv, 1330-1332. 


761 





but such statute (or way, Ps. 2) the first doctrine of 
the incarnation of the Son of God in itself, and is 
drawn to a certain line, namely of Shem 2c. 
Afterwards also here is to be heard of the Godhead 
of this son of Shem. He will be a son of man, born of 
a virgin, but also the son of God. Therefore he calls 
him Elohe, because the whole Godhead dwells bodily 
in him. And he calls him Jehovah, who, though he is 
another person than the Father, yet by nature and 
essence he is the true God, true man. This he 
received from Eve's confession through the Holy 
Spirit, who also confessed that this man, or the 
promised seed, was the Messiah. Just as Jeremiah 
and others gave this name to Messiah afterwards. In 
the word "blessed" not only the divine service of 
Messiah is described, that he is to be praised, 
preached and called as true man and Son of God, as 
the angel says to Mary Luc. 1, but also the whole 
office, kingdom, and noblest service of faith, with the 
effect. For he alone is called blessed to praise, to call 
and to preach. 

But he who is to be preached must also have a 
kingdom, people and church. The angel clearly says: 
"Whose dominion shall be without end"; or, the Lord 
God Shem will be praised and preached until the end 
of the world, and will have a church and multitude, in 
which the blessed promise of the revelation and 
forgiveness of sins will resound. For the following text 
of Japheth completely confesses that Noah 
prophesied here about the tents of Shem. Therefore 
he speaks here full of joy, not only in general of the 
people of God, which should be gathered from the 
Gentiles and Jews, but also in particular of the 
preservation of the descendants of Shem until the 
birth of Christ. The patriarch sees in the Spirit the 
excellent glory of the Semites, their victories and 
prophets until the birth of Christ, and in Japheth the 
preservation of the Catholic Church until the end of 
the world. Zechariah no doubt begins his song from 
this prophecy 2c. These are the great mysteries that 
the patriarch received from the spirit and the promise 
to Adam and the confession of Eve, and the voice of 
God at the 


Altar Noah, Cap. 8, was revealed, where it is clearly 
taught: God is reconciled through this man, who will 
be born of Shem. 


Therefore, the Benedictus (praised be) must not 
only be understood in a suffering way, that the 
Messiah should be praised, preached and glorified, 
and that he is full of all spiritual blessings, but also 
that this blessed (or praised) one will come in the 
name of the Lord, Ps. 118 2c., and that he will bless 
all generations of the earth out of his fullness, and out 
of his essential as well as shared blessing power. For 
he is also called Redeemer (or a helper), Zech. 9, not 
only because he was snatched out of death by life 
and salvation, but also because he communicates 
his salvation, righteousness, wisdom, glory to us. So 
also here "blessed", meaning that he blesses us and 
makes us partakers of his blessing through faith 2c. 
The Son of God, as the interpreter of the Holy Trinity, 
not only brought forth this counsel of grace (or 
statute) from the bosom of his Father in Paradise, but 
also explained it afterwards and made it ever clearer. 
Noah knows expressly and clearly that the promised 


seed is Jehovah's elohe; Jacob that he is an embryo 
or female child in the womb; Isaiah that he is the 
virgin's son. So, since the Word (the independent 
one) speaks to Abraham, he declares himself in this 
way of speaking: "In your seed", which is Christ, “all 
the nations of the earth will be blessed", or will have 
from his Gospel through faith forgiveness of sins, 
reconciliation, righteousness and the same 
imputation, eternal life, protection and also other gifts 
in this life. 


"For Canaan will be his 1) servant." 


Christ will throw all enemies under his feet, they 
will not succumb. This is the spiritual blessing of the 
Church, which Paul speaks of in Eph. 1. It has been 
prepared for us and distributed to us by the giving 
God through the giving Seed, and revealed to us in 
the blessing and in the sweet voice of the Gospel, 
that we also may receive the blessing justified, and 
become the redeemed of God and His children and 
heirs.

So much of the materials of this saying, which are 
drawn from the power and meaning of the words, and 
the preceding and following text and good concluding 
speeches. They are similar to the faith, agreeing with 
the prophets and apostles and Catholic Church 
testimonies. 

Of the formalities it is not necessary to say. The 
ancients used short speech and laconic expression; 
they also have their aborted sayings, which they call 


cabbalas, which were worthy of all reception and 
wanted to have a diligent interpreter. If one wants to 
call the last words a creed, prophecy or testament, 
he will not do wrong. 


From the causes. 


3 The interpreter should see who is speaking. A 

patriarch, prophet, bishop. By what impulse? The 
Holy Spirit, says St. Peter. By whose sending? By 
direct sending of the Son of God, chap. 9. By what 
cause? Noah, who wants to reveal the wrath of God 
against the hardened and unbelieving son, so 
mocked the Son of God in his loins, threatens with 
eternal judgment or subjection taken from the curse 
of the serpent, Gen. 3. 
On the other hand, since he [w. 26. 27.] wants to 
teach and comfort even the most obedient sons who 
worship and kiss the Son of God in the loins of the 
Father, he prophesies of great ge 


as if he said: As Canaan and all who do not believe 
in the Son of God will be eternally subject to Christ 
and his brothers, Ps. 110. 1 Cor. 15, so you, Shem 
and Japheth, will be blessed and have descendants 
for eternal life. You will reign at the right hand of the 
Father with the blessed Son of God, because you 
believe in the Son of God who will spring from your 
descendants. 


The end purpose. 


4 Here the interpreter thinks that this was testified 
by the Holy Spirit through the patriarch, that the Son 
of God should be known, and that men should 
believe and be saved through the word. For what was 
written before is written now, and that the church, 
which is founded on the apostles and prophets, has 
firm and certain testimonies of its religion, and it is 
known how the pure doctrine of the Son of God was 
brought forth and propagated by the Holy Spirit in the 
prophets from one century to another, until it has 
come to us at the end of the world. For this also is 
written by Moses, as also John says, that we believe 
JEsus to be Christ, the Son of GOD and of the Virgin, 
our King, High Priest and Blessing Man, and that 
through faith in His written and preached Word we 
have eternal life. Amen.

by all rights (where the fugitive jack would have 
gotten) he would have cheaply lost his head. 

2 So that |, as the absentee of our dear Lord parish 
priest, D. Johann Pommers (for he would 
undoubtedly not suffer it either, as we all know well), 
who has to be a stopgap and sub-priest, do not let 
such blasphemous, malicious mischievousness 
remain on me; for | am too weighed down with my 
own sins that | cannot suffer to burden myself with 
many other people's sins (especially such shameful 
boys, who learn and see much better from us every 
day, but who show such shameful ingratitude as a 
reward): | beg and exhort all pious and true 
Christians, who have and love the same faith and 
doctrine with us, to put away such blasphemy and 
burn it in honor of our holy gospel, so that our 
adversaries may not have to boast, as they are 
inclined to write of us in foreign nations, that we do 
not punish vices, although they know well that we 
punish them more severely than they do in their 
regiment, especially in their spiritual one. 


chaste holiness wanted to put on the calculation 
lines. 

3. moreover, because the same Schaudpoetaster 
praises the tiresome town clerk of Halle (to speak 
with leave), bishop Albrecht, and makes a saint out 
of the devil, | do not suffer that this happens publicly 
and through the pressure in this church, school and 
city, because the same shit bishop is a false lying 
man, and yet uses to call us the Lutheran boys, 
although he will hear from St. Moritz and St. Stephan 
the right main jacks on that day. Moritz and St. 
Stephen, as he well knows, but consoles himself that 
he does not believe such things. And |, if God gives 
me life and time, will give such a beautiful example 
on that day. And ask all of us, and especially the 
poets or his hypocrites, not to publicly praise or extol 
the shameful shit-monkey in this church, school and 
city. If not, they may also wait together with their lord 
what | will do against it, and know that | do not want 
to suffer that one praises the hopeless priest 
condemned by himself (who would like to have us all 
dead) here in Wittenberg. More about this soon. 
1538. 


In the first book, Lemnius wrote some strongly erotic poems, including mocking poems about husbands who had been betrayed by their 
wives, or about withered beauties who still desired a lover, and epigrams of this kind, in which one or the other of the Wittenberg personalities 
might have felt affected; but it will be difficult to prove how far Lemnius had really aimed at particular individuals. The most repulsive thing 
about those epigrams were the flatteries against Archbishop Albrecht running through the two books." But Kawerau 1. e. p. 127 adds that 
Lemnius had proved by later, at the beginning of the year 1539, published books of shame, "that Luther had basically taxed him quite 
correctly". Melanchthon was at that time the Rector of the University, who was responsible for the censorship of the books to be published, 
but in this case he had not done his duty. The writing caused a great stir and Luther, because Bugenhagen was absent, publicly testified 
against it in the pulpit on Trinity Sunday, June 16, 1538. His "admonition" is found in excerpt in the Table Talks, Cap. 28, § 13, and the 
"printed mandate" mentioned at the end of this section, which he read out, is probably our writing (St. Louis edition, vol. XXII, 940 ff.). The 
title of the same in the Wittenberg edition is "Wider des Buben M. Simon Lemnii Epigrammata." It is found in the Wittenberg (1559), vol. XII, 
p. 290; in the Jena (1568), vol. VI, p. 532d; in the Altenburg, vol. VI, p. 1252; in the Leipzig, vol. XXII, p. 592; in De Wette, vol. VI, p. 198, 
and in the Erlangen, vol. 64, p. 322. We give the text of the Wittenberg edition. - One compares me still the table speech with Lauterbach of 
June 20, 1538, St. Louiser edition, vol. XXII, 1732, No. 200. We have put the title, which the writing has in the Jena edition, over it, the date 
is according to Seidemann with De Wette I. o.

To the worthy, highly esteemed Mr. Johann Cochleo, 
princely preacher at Dresden, my _ favorable 
master and friend. 

1. my willing service and all the good before. Worthy, 
esteemed Doctor! A strange, strange story has recently 
taken place in this laudable city of Leipzig, of which you 
certainly do not know (as | respect), which is why | have 
not refrained from reporting it to you, since we are all 
interested in it in no small way, and you can certainly do 
something about it and give advice. Our preacher here 
in Leipzig 1) (as you know

for himself through his vituperative pulpit speeches against Luther 
and the Protestants. Seidemann, Beitrage zur 
Reformationgeschichte, p. 105. 


who praises your beautiful booklets in the pulpit as a 
divine, heavenly scripture, has so far preached against 
the black devil at Wittenberg, the poisonous heretic 
Martin Luther, for so long and so well that it has (praise 
and thanks to God!) brought great fruit and has brought 
many of the devilish heresy back to the old, former faith, 
and has preserved much more that it is entirely hoped 
that such heresy will be restored.) has brought great 
fruit, and has converted many of the devilish heresy, and 
has brought them back to the old previous faith, and has 
preserved much more, that it is to be hoped completely 
that such heresy should almost have an end, and go out 
like a spark, where one will continue and stop like this. 
Accordingly, two highly respected (though young) men, 
Johann Hasenberg and Joachim von der Heyde, who is 
an excellent poet, have taken up your and his teachings, 


and are helping to promote the cause, and have given 
very good advice. 





*Two magisters in Leipzig, namely Johann Hasenberg, a Bohemian, and Joachim von der Hehden, called My- ricianus, a Frisian, 
attacked Luther and his wife in 1528 because of their marriage. This happened in the writing: "Czwen sendbriefe, Latein vnd deutzsch oem 
Lutther vnd seynem vormeynthem ehelichem Wehbe Kethen von Bhore sampt einem geschenck, freundtlicher meynung tzuuorfertiget, 
Anno. 1.5.28." At the end: "Gedruckt zu Leyptzick durch Balten Schumann, des Jars. D.M.xxviij." 20 quarto leaves. On the first six leaves is 
Hasenberg's letter, beginning on page “ij: M. Joann.es Hasenbergius Bohemus Martino Ludero Publicae 
et pacis et pietatis perturbatori and is dated: I-‘psiae in teriis I-anr6ntiani8 sio. Augusts, *nno n 6Uri8to. tVl.v.xxvij. On the second sheet 
with the signature B follows: "Joachim von der Heyden, wunscheth Kethen von Bhore Luthers vormeynthem eheweybe, Gnad zu bekerung, 
in Christo Jesu vnserem Seligmacher, 2c. WEHe dyr armen vorfurthen weybe" 2c. This letter is dated: "Datum zu Leyptzck am tag Laurentii 
slO. Augusti Anno M.D.xxviij." On the third bottom, on sheet C, begins a translation of the writing of Ambrosius: “inbromi as tapsn virZini8 
6on866ratu6 with the caption: "Des heyligen lehrers Sanct Ambrosij Bischoffs zu Maylanth buchlem an eyne geschwechte Nunnen aus dem 
Lateyn in das Deutzsch gebracht. That a pious person should grieve because of the fact that the virgin was given to God. This writing has 
‘en chapters, but it is not completely translated. - The authors sent their booklet to Wittenberg by their own messenger, but Luther did not let 
him in because he was burdened with business. However, he ordered his servants to accept and read the booklet. These people destroyed 
he book and gave it back to the same messenger together with a letter. How disgraceful the booklet had been, the Wittenbergers now made 
known to all the world in a small writing: "Xorv. 26ittnnK. von I-eiptLiZ." 1H sheet in quarto, without year and place. This consists of a fingirten 
correspondence between Hieronymus Walter in Leipzig and Johann Cochlaus in Dresden; each of the two letters has an enclosure. These 
documents are dated August 17, 18, and 19. The inmZinarins Hder mentioned in Luther's letter to Eberhard Brisger (toward the end of 
August 1528, Erlanger Briefwechsel, vol. 6, p. 362; not dated April 8, De Wette, vol. 3, p. 299), and the writing commemorated in his letter 
‘o Wenceslaus Link (dated August 16 or 28, 1 1528, Erl. Br.-W., vol. 6, p. 360; not of Aug. 6, De Wette, vol. 3, p. 365), is the "Neue Zeitung"

thought to settle the matter most recently; thus: 
because Luther is obdurate, and does not heed any 
admonition, they have undertaken to admonish his 
supposed wife, the runaway nun, Kethe von Bore, 
next to him with public writing, and have truly placed 
a splendidly beautiful booklet at her disposal, which | 
cannot read to my fill with great joy, especially 
because our praiseworthy preacher's art is almost 
the most in it. For | and all of us thought, where we 
could snatch the nun from the villain, his heresy 
would soon sing: Heli, Heli, and have holy evening; if 
not, then they would both have such shame before 
all the world that they would never have a day of 
peace with each other, especially because all the 
writings that went out in Leipzig have great reputation 
and do excellent things, even among all the heretics, 
both in Wittenberg and in Bohemia, as the blessed 
Emser's and D. Ochsenfart's books, but especially 
the highly respected poet Miritianus Carmen well 
prove. | will keep silent about what your books do, 
which no heretic can stand. Oh, how happy things 
would have been, and how we would have laughed 
at the infernal heretic. 

But, what shall | say (Il beg you, you want to 
keep it secret), we have truly all, in my opinion, 
thrown in our pants, the devil's name. For when the 
two highly learned men sent their little book to Witten 
with their own food and messengers 





berg, the cursed heretic (as the messenger says) has 
been charged in several matters with electoral 
envoys to Brandenburg 1) that the messenger may 
not have occurred. But he ordered his servants to 
accept and read such booklets until he was released. 
Then hear what wicked boys do: they kept the 
messenger honest, but they took the noble booklet 
and carried it to the office, where it stinks, and 
illuminated it, even shat on it, and wiped their butts 
onit, as shamefully as if it were not from the laudable 
high school and scholars of Leipzig, but from the 
coarsest school. It is as disgraceful as if it had come 
not from the laudable high school and scholars in 
Leipzig, but from the crudest school of bachelors and 
donkeys on earth. After that, they closed it up again 
with dirt and everything, and sent it over again with 
the same messenger and a letter next to it full of 
mockery and scolding, in which there is a strange 
figure full of crosses, drawn with letters, but | do not 
know what it is. Those | have asked say that where 
one starts from the middle letter and spells it out, one 


finds the word ASINI forty times, calculated most 
precisely, perhaps they want to give it to be 
understood that our preacher, such a booklet holy 
spirit, is forty times an ass; where then would

certe Luderus Nonnam suo sponso Christo, matrique Ecclesiae, postliminio reponat. M.D.xxiij. 6 quarto leaves, without 
indication of the place. The letters and especially the decorated initial letters show that Schumann also printed this edition. The Erlangen 
edition (Br.-W., vol. 6, p. 322) considers this to be the first printing. The text is, apart from a few insignificant deviations, identical to the one 
mentioned before. - After the appearance of the "Neue Zeitung," Joachim von der Heyden had his Sendbrief printed in a second edition, 
augmented with a "Condition" (Ein Blatt), which precedes the Sendbrief. The title reads: "Ein Sentbrief, Kethen von Bhore, Luthers 
vormeinthem eheweybe sampt eynem geschenck freuntlicher meynung tzuvorfertigt. Dartzu eyne Bedingung auf der Wittenberger 
lesterschrifft." 16 quarto sheets, without indication of location. As in the first edition, the letter is dated Laurentii, Monday, August 10; the 
"condition" from "Mitwoch nach Egidi", September 2, 1528. In contrast, the Wittenbergers now published the following: "Ein newe fabel Esopi 
Nemlich verdeudscht gefunden. Vom Lawen vnd Esel." This consists of a letter from the Wittenberg "JIluminists" to "Miritionos", the fable 
itself, and a fingirten postscript by "H. W." from Halle. The latter is dated: "Sonntags nach Mauritij [den 27. SeptZ. In M.D.xxviij. Jar." Hasenberg 
then sent out a few more counter-scripts, which, however, were not heeded by the Wittenbergers. - There has been much dispute among 
scholars about whether these writings had Luther himself as the author or not. Also we cannot contribute anything certain about it, but we 
agree with the opinion of Késtlin ("M. Luther", Vol. Il, p. 152): "We will be allowed to attribute these counter-writings to Luther himself without 
hesitation with the old tradition. - The Erlangen edition has included the two missives of Hasenberg and Miritian, as dirty and blasphemous as 
they are, in its sixth volume of "Dr. Martin Luther's Briefwechsel"! - We have corrected the parts of our writing, which were in all editions up to 
now in wrong order. In the editions our writing can be found: in the Eisleben one, vol. |, p. 420 b and vol. Il, p. 5b; in the Altenburg one, vol. 
IV, p. 431; in the Leipzig one, vol. XXII, p. 584 and in the Erlangen one, vol. 64, p. 324.

MJRJCJANUS and HASENBERG stay? And where did | 
myself want to stay, who praised everything so highly 
myself? We should probably have more dog-ears than 
hair on our head, if one wanted to reckon with it. Isn't that 
a shameful, disgraceful trade? This is what the desperate 
heretic disciples and the damned Wittenbergers do. They 
pretend that we ourselves should first be chaste and pious 
in Leipzig, and that we should first punish and mend our 
fornication and whoredom, and that we should first sweep) 
away the dirt from our door before we tear the splinter out 
of the other's eye, and that we should not forget our beam. 

3 There was a beautiful, masterly title on our booklet, 
put in the most Leipzig and artificial way, that it should be 
a gift, friendly opinion, made by Kethen von Boren. But, 
the devil! what a shameful tip they gave for the gift. 
However, | am very much disturbed by two things: First, 
that our praiseworthy preacher and the two highly learned 
men's poems and suggestions have been so completely 
destroyed by the lost nun, and that our art and friendly 
opinion (understand me well) have been so shamefully 
lacking. After that, with our money and effort, we had to 
fetch heretic filth and stink to Wittenberg; and it should 
easily have happened, if the messenger had not carried a 
messenger box, that he would have had to declare such 
shameful goods, to our great mockery and damage. 

What do we want to do about this? My advice and 
friendly request is, because you are with our gracious lord 
in the place of the blessed Emser, that you help us to see 
to it that we bring forth a commandment from our gracious 
lord against such a case and such a journey, so that 
henceforth we do not have to supply dirt for money, even 
if we send out much smaller books than this has been. 
For if the people were to be accustomed to it, and such 
stinking trade were to break down, this princely city, and 
all trades, should suffer a much more noticeable loss than 
is now the access, which comes from evil coin, as you 
have to consider. Also so that the two highly learned 
gentlemen, and the preacher, do not receive reward for 
their art and skill, and receive disgrace as a reward, it 
seems to me that this is not the case. 


It would be good for me if it were forbidden that no one 
had to call Miricianum the shitty poet, neither here nor in 
Wittenberg, because everyone knows well that his 
Carmiua are so delicious that they almost attain virginity. 
Send herewith a copy of the above-mentioned stinking 
letter, because you will find me willing and ready to serve 
you. Given at Leipzig, Monday after Assumptionis 
[August 17] in the 1528th year. Hieronymus 
Walter,

Our most humble services before and after, high 
scholars and respectable supposed poets and rhetors. 
We add to your exuberant art and wisdom that the 
heretic, Martin Luther, has not read your excellent poem 
and art, because he, burdened with other things, did not 
let the messenger come to him, but nevertheless 
ordered us to accept such a booklet until he would be 
released. But because the matter was urgent, we have 
subjected ourselves to answering your art. And we do 
not want to conceal from your erudition that we 
encountered much darkness while reading. Therefore 
we have caused to illuminate such your booklet; as such 
booklets are well worth, and you will see, not only for us, 
but also for yourselves. For we fear that you yourselves 
do not know well what you have written in it. So it is not 
new that Leipzig, the noble city, has to nourish such 
bachants and coarse, large asses. But if this color is not 
pleasing to your wisdom, you might well send another 
such booklet, and we will endeavor to illuminate it more 
thoroughly.

[Enclosure to previous letter.] 


To the worthy and esteemed Mr. Johann Cochleo, 
princely preacher at Dresden, my favorable 
master and good friend. 

My willing service before. | add E. W. friendly opinion 
to know when I next on the return journey to Leipzig 
in the 


Luther and his supposed wife was brought over the 
table and read. | must speak to you kindly and freely: 
What do such our young spoons do, that they hang 
on to the man, and get involved in such things, 
without bringing disgrace and dishonor, scorn and 
mockery to the laudable city of Leipzig and our 
famous high school with their untimely and foolish 
writing? You will not believe the words | have to eat 
into me because of them; they want to fly before they 
have grown feathers, looked at the back when they 
should start at the front, and leave the means to do 
so. They exhort a nun who has gone astray back to 
the monastery, and yet they do not teach how right 
and godly a monastic life is. Do you not think that 
Luther taught his wife, and still teaches, how right she 
is to live and remain outside the monastery, and how 
wrong she would be if she ran back into it? as he tried 
and undertook both these things with great 
earnestness through many books. But our young 
spoons think that his wife has such faith as they have, 
that monastic life is holy and right, and therefore 
proceed with a naked, mere admonition, wanting to 
put in honor. So we have to hear in the countryside 
how the noble city of Leipzig has vainly 
presumptuous asses' heads; as | had to hear over 
tables that a fine man of the world spoke to this 
booklet: | mean that the fine city of Leipzig must be 
especially plagued with coarse asses; write, and do 
not know what they write, just as if it were enough 
when they write a book, especially at these times, 
when so many learned people and worldly wise men 
are. So | kindly ask you to be there, so that the young 
rags may change their attitude; do they want to 
provoke Luther or his wife to the monastery again, so 
that they first teach and instruct how monastic life is 
holy and right. For if Luther and his wife thought that 
the monastic life was holy and right, | think that our 
Leipzigers should have no naked admonition; their 
consciences would admonish and urge them 
themselves. 

But now we let them remain in conscience that 
monastic life is unjust, and we let them stay in the 
same way.

If we admonish someone to run inside, we cause even 
more laughter and mockery with our admonition, as if | 
wanted to admonish him to eat cake, because he 
believes that there is poison inside. | would first have to 
persuade him that there is no poison but delicious 
medicine inside. Let our fools [in] the devil's name learn 
their rhetorica and poetica better, we do with such a way 
to defend our faith that | myself think more of Luther than 
of ours. Luther first teaches and proves what he wants, 
then he exhorts; our spoons can do nothing but exhort: 
they place the teaching and proving on their own 
thoughts, just as if they were sure that everyone believes 
as they believe. If our preacher has been there, he is as 
wise as he wants to be. Tell them that this matter does 


not want to be dealt with in genere deliberativo, sed in 
genere judiciali at this time, do they understand their 
rhetoric differently, or are they theologians, quod non in 


exhortatione, sed in doctrina sit sita, as Paul says 
Rom. 12, as Luther did in his books. If they do not do 
this, then they accomplish nothing else than to 
strengthen Luther and his wife with their lazy, 
unconvincing exhortation, to their own mockery and 
ridicule; for one must first prove the wrong and error, and 
convince the conscience, otherwise all is lost, and make 
their little book in 


the apothecaries or to the secret chamber. You can see 
how Luther writes so powerfully and thrusts himself 
about, and these spoons attack him with bare, 
unleavened paper; this distorts me from ours to a great 
extent. They may have printed the epistle Hieronym 1) 
next to it, but what does Luther ask about it? If they have 
read none of his books at all, then they are foolish, 
presumptuous rags; but if they have read them, then they 
must be nonsensical. Luther wants to have Scripture, 
and to have proven that Jerome rightly speaks the 
monastic life holy and good; he knows almost well that 
fornication is wrong, as such an example gives. But 
where are here our young poets and rhetors who prove 
with writings that monastics must have such a 
conscience as Jerome says here? | have written this to 
E. W. in a hurry, hope to talk to you more about it orally; 
if we want nothing else than to write, then silence would 
suit us well. | am willing to serve you. Given at Leipzig, 
Dinstags Agapiti 2) [August 18], 1528. 


1) "Hieronymi" is intentionally written instead of: Ambrosii. 

2) "Dinstags Agapiti" put by us instead of "Dinstags nach Agapiti". 
The date of this letter is, like the letter itself, of course fingirt, but it 
must, if it is to have meaning, in any case be earlier than that of the 
document with which it claims to be sent. Now, however, Agapetus in 
1528 is a Tuesday. The Dinstag after Agapeti would be then the 25th 
August. Possibly one did not think of it with setting the date, and meant 
by the fact that Dinstag is earlier than Wednesday, to be safe from an 
anachronism. 


b. Aesop's fable of the lion and the donkey. 


To the most learned collegiate and supposed poet of 
Leipzig, Johann 3) Miritionos. 

1. we add to you, you most learned collegiate and 
supposed poet, to know that to the heretic Martin Luther 
your other present book 4) has been given before us; 
and he does not want to give us 


3) His name is: Joachim. 

4) This is the second edition of the book of Myricianus (Joachim 
von der Heyden): "Ein Sentbrief, Kethen von Bhore, Luthers 
vormeynthem eheweybe sampt eynem geschenck freuntlicher 
mehnung tzuvorfertigt". 





But he said, "The donkey's head illuminates itself all too 
well, and threw it into a corner. But we wonder at your 
great ingratitude, that you first learned through our 
illuminating, how you are too little of things, and do not 
understand them, as you now testify of yourself, 5) and 
do not like us for it. 


5) This is done in the "condition" attached to the "Sentbrief, Kethen 
von Bhore" 2c. "In this condition, Myricianus says that he is too little to 
disputiren with Luther.

But if we did not spare your presumed poetry, we 
would say that you are a dishonorable, lying knave, 
who, as a common judge, publicly condemns a pious 
woman before all the world and shouts her out for a 
faithless, perjured, runaway whore, and yet you say 
that you do not know and do not understand the 
matter. Where did you learn the virtue of defiling 
people, and yet you confess that you do not 
understand and are too ignorant of the matter? We 
are surprised that you should be so bold as to walk 
the streets of Leipzig, where there are so many good, 
honest citizens, and in the high school so many 
exquisite men, doctors, magistrates and students, 
against whom you can be counted no more than 
horse manure among apples. 

2. Nor is your arrogance so great that you, filth and 
stink of the praiseworthy city and highly famous 
school, break out alone, and sing under the beautiful 


apples of Leipzig, Nos poma natamus, 1) as if you 
were the one jewel of Leipzig, and the others were all 
filth and muck against you; from which one may well 
feel that you coarse snotspoon and donkey's head 
have never learned either discipline or honor, and do 
not respect such fine people, whom you should take 
to counsel in your writing, or grab your hat against 
them. Thou shouldst sweat with shame when thou 
lookest at a house in Leipzig, and think that stone and 
wood would see thine iniquity, and spy upon thee. 
But because you are a supposed poet, we want to 
keep quiet about this, otherwise you might become 
angry and proceed against the blasphemers. 
Therefore we are afraid, and consider it better to 
have your friendship, and ask you to be merciful to 
us. And as a sign of our humility, we hereby send you 
a friendly gift, a new fable, so that your poetry may 
have a matter to practice and gain honor. 

3) For we have seen, because thou Oecolampad, 
spread with rods, 2) hast denied that thine 


1) The full meaning of this proverb is: We apples swim, said the 
horse manure, when he swam under the apples. 
2) That is, that Oecolampad was struck out with ruts. This is asserted 
in the four distichs which have the superscription: In “oannein 
Oeeolampadiurn vol potius Oseosiotuin alia" 8u8<Miv, virZis 
eaosnin. 3. LI. 





idle art seeks cause to prove itself. But allow you, as 
a supposed poet, where you want to make such 
fables into verses or feet, that you may well put five 
feet in a verse 3) or even seven, and not, as more 
arid poets do, only need six feet. How else would you 
be a supposed poet? So you also have good 
examples. If a horse has only four feet, and a 
caterpillar twenty, shouldn't your poetry make as 
many feet as it wants? A louse has six feet, therefore 
all other poets are vain lousy verses, with their six 
feet. Miritionos alone is a traveling poet, with feet as 
he pleases. But if thou canst not break thy wrath, and 
wilt eat us, we pray thee, if thou wilt lift up the bottom 
of the seat, then thou wilt keep cornpest and mustard 
beforehand.

A new fable Aesopi, recently found translated, 
of the lion and the donkey. 


The old lion fell ill and called upon all the animals 
to hold his last imperial diet and to appoint his heir, 
the young lion, as king in his place. The animals came 
obediently and accepted the old lion's last will. But 
when the old lion died, and was buried gloriously, as 
befits a king, some unfaithful, false advisors of the old 
king, whom the old king had done much good and 


helped to great honors, came forward: Nolumus 


hunc regnare super nos; they pointed out how cruelly 
the lions had ruled until now, how they tore and 
devoured the innocent animals, so that no one could 
be safe from them; as it then happens that all good 
things are kept silent, and only the worst things are 
spoken of by the overlords. 

2nd From this speech there was a great murmur 
among all the estates of the kingdom; some of them 
wanted to keep the young lion, but the 


3) In the original: "in one verse". -In the five distichs which have the 
superscription: ckouaUirni M“ricnuni IMri80m486N8i8 ast |4utUsrurn 
odsurZatio, the third hexameter is one foot too short.

779 





Several parts also wanted to try another. Finally, they 
were asked together to choose the full word of the 
majority and to put an end to the matter. Then the 
false, unfaithful councilors had made the fox the 
speaker, who was to speak before the estates of the 
kingdom, and gave fine instructions and lessons on 
how he should propose the donkey. At first it was 
ridiculous to the fox himself that a donkey should be 
king; but when he heard their concern about how 
freely they could live under the donkey, and would like 
to rule it as they wished, the mischievous man put up 
with it, and helped faithfully, fasted the matter as he 
wanted to present it nicely. 

(3) And he came out before the people of the 
kingdom, and reproached them, and commanded 
silence, and began to speak of the kingdom's distress 
and grievous things, but drove the whole speech to 
the effect that the king's fault had been, and so 
nullified the lion's sex that the people fell away 
altogether. But since there was a great doubt as to 
which animal should be chosen, he again ordered 
silence and listening, and gave the donkey's gender, 
and spent about an hour on the donkey's praise, how 
the donkey was neither proud nor tyrannical, did a lot 
of work, was patient and humble, let another animal 
also be something, and did not have much to offer, 
was also not cruel, did not eat the animals, let him be 
content with little honor and interest. When the fox 
noticed that this tickled the mob and pleased them, he 
made the right addition and said: "About this, dear 
sirs, we have to think that he might also be ordained 
and created for this by God, which could be noticed 
by the fact that he carries a cross on his back forever. 

4th When the fox remembered the cross, all the 
estates of the kingdom sat down before it, and fell 
down with a great noise, saying, Now have we found 
the right king, which can destroy both the temporal 
and spiritual government. Then each one praised 
something about the donkey; one said, he had fine 
long ears, which were good for hearing confessions; 
the other said, he also had a good voice, which was 
well suited for preaching and singing in the churches. 
There was nothing about the whole donkey that was 
not worthy of royal and papal honors. But above all 
other virtues, the cross on the donkey shone. 





Back. So the donkey was chosen as king among the 
animals. 

The poor young lion went miserable and 
sorrowful, as an outcast orphan from his hereditary 
kingdom, until some old, faithful, pious councilors 
(who were sorry for such trade) took pity on him, and 
discussed how it was a blasphemous sin that one 
should let the young king be so shamefully outcast, 
his father had not deserved such for them. It should 
also not happen in the kingdom, as the fox and his 
companions wanted, who sought their own courage 
and not the kingdom's honor. They gathered 
themselves together and asked the imperial estates 
to come forward with something necessary. Then the 
eldest, who was an old dog, a loyal advisor to the old 
lion, came out and told with a beautiful soeech how 
such a choice of the donkey would be too easy and 
too hasty, and the lion would have done a great 
injustice; not all that glitters there would have to be 
gold. 

(6) The ass, even if it had the cross on its back, 
could be a sham and nothing behind it, as all the world 
is deceived by glitter and good appearances. The lion 
would have proved his virtue by his deed, but the 
donkey would have proved no deed; therefore they 
should take care that they do not choose a king who 
is no more than a carved image, which might well 
bear a cross. And if there were a war, they would not 
know what the vain cross could do for them, if there 
were nothing more behind it. 

Such a serious, brave speech of the dog moved 


Omnes. The fox and the unfaithful robbers were 
afraid, pretending that what had been decided in the 
kingdom should remain; but the crowd was 
nevertheless moved by the fact that the donkey had 
never proved anything with the deed, and that the 
cross might well have deceived them; and yet they 
could not go back with the election. Finally, since the 
dog pressed so hard for the deed and for the false 
appearance of the cross, it was granted by his 
suggestion that the donkey should fight with the lion 
for the kingdom, whoever would win would be king; 
they could not do otherwise now, because the 
election had taken place in the kingdom. Then the 
young lion regained his heart, and all the pious 
subjects had great hope. But the fox hung his tail with 
his companions, and took care of himself.

781 





not much chivalrous fight to their new king, unless it 
wanted to ring with Farzens, or with Distelfressens. 
The day of battle was set, and all the animals came 
to the square; the fox held fast to the donkey, the dog 
to the lion. 

8th The donkey let the lion choose the fight. The 
lion said, "Well, he who jumps over this brook, so that 
he does not wet a foot, shall be the winner. But it was 
a big brook. The lion took to it and jumped over it as 
a bird would fly over it. The donkey and the fox 
thought: Well, we have not been kings before, dare 
wins, dare loses; he had to jump, and jumped into the 
middle of the brook, like a block falling into it. Then 
the lion jumped around on the bank and said: | mean 
yes, the foot is wet. But now look what luck and 
cunning can do. A small fish had gotten tangled in 
the donkey's ear under the water and was caught; 
when the donkey crawled out of the brook and the 
animals had laughed themselves to pieces, the fox 
saw that the donkey was shaking the fish out of his 
ear and said, "Now be quiet and listen. 

(9) Where then are they that despise the cross, 
that it can prove no virtue? My lord, King Donkey, 
says: He would have jumped over the brook, but that 
would have been a bad art for him to prove the virtue 
of his cross, as the lion and other animals do without 
a cross; but he saw a little fish in the brook while 
jumping, so he jumped after it, and that the miracle 
of his cross would be all the greater if he did not see 
it with his mouth or paws, but with his ears: let the 
lion also do this, and then be king. But | think he 
should not catch a fish with his mouth and all four 
legs, if he would go after it, let alone jump. The fox 
made a fuss again with such talk, and the cross 
wanted to win badly. The hound was annoyed by the 
luck, but much more that the false fox with his fox tail 
thus fooled the bunch, began to bark, it would have 
been schInmps so gerathen, and no wonder. 

010 But lest the bite of the fox and the hound 
should cause a disturbance, it was thought good that 
the lion and the hound should be kept away. 





Donkeys went alone to a place and fought there. 

(11) They went to a wood, to the kingdom's escort 
and peace. The lion who sows the most agile animal 
is the one who counts," said the lion. And he ran into 
the wood and hunted until he saw a hare. The lazy 
donkey thought that the kingdom would cost me too 
much trouble, that he should have no peace with the 
wise man, and he lay down in the sun and lapped at 
it with his tongue: 1) Then a raven came, thinking that 
it was a carrion, and sat down on his lips and wanted 
to eat, but the donkey snapped at him and killed the 
raven. 2) When the lion came running happily with his 
hare, he found the raven in the donkey's mouth, and 
was frightened; in short, it was lost, and now he 
himself began to dread the cross of the donkey, but 
he did not like to leave the kingdom, and said: "Dear 
donkey, there is still one thing for the sake of good 
fellows, all good things should come in threes. The 
donkey did half of it out of fear, because he was alone 
with him, and accepted it. 

012 And the lion said, Beyond the mountain is a 
mill: he that getteth there first shall have the spoil: wilt 
thou go down thither, or over the mountain? And the 
ass said, Run thou over the mountain. The lion, as in 
the last fight, ran as far as he could run. The donkey 
stood still and thought: | will become a mockery, and 
make my legs tired when | run; so | realize that the 
lion does not begrudge me the honor, so | will not 
work in vain. When the lion comes over the mountain, 
he sees a donkey standing in front of the mill. Has the 
devil already brought you here? Well, once more 
back to our place; but when he comes over again, he 
sees the donkey standing there; for the third time also 
(he said) back to the mill, there he sees the donkey 
standing there for the third time, and must give the 
donkey victory, and confess that the cross is not to be 
joked with. So the donkey remained king, and to this 
day his family reigns mightily in the world among the 
animals.

To the strict and firm H. V. B., 1) my favorable 
master and dear brother. 


1. my willing service before. Kind sir and dear 
brother! The other booklet of Miritianus, which you 
sent to me, has come to me, if it is another booklet, 
because methinks it is the previous one; perhaps they 
were not able to expel the first one, that necessity 
forced them to decorate the last sixth under another 
veil. Or perhaps Miritianus' art has become so light 
that it has dried up so soon and can no longer do 
anything. The dear spoons have done a fine job, they 
themselves confess that they are too little in the 
matter, and yet they have taken the liberty of writing 
against this matter. They should have this in mind, 
and write what they can, as Horatius teaches them: 


Versate diu quid valeant humeri. 

| am surprised that the rector of the university 
does not forbid the fools their foolish writing, so that 
they brew vain shame, as you also indicate in your 
letter. But you are also too Lutheran, and make too 
much of the mockery of our Leipzig poets. They are 
not all Miritian in Leipzig, they themselves have his 
poetry for foolishness and children's work. | was 
recently in a good company, where Miritianus had to 
be the show dinner: some cursed him, some called 
him not Miritianus, but Miritionos. (Some thought that 
if Duke George knew that he was such a proud 
donkey, he would take away his collegiate position 
and ban him from the city. It was their common 
complaint that they had to be ashamed of the 
Miritionos among learned people everywhere. 

| wanted to speak his best, and said that he had, 
in addition to his writing, translated Ambrosii's epistle 
and let it go, which should be spared; then | arrived 
right. Yes, they said, you really hit the nail on the 
head, it

Miritionos did not have enough to prove his ass's 
head to Luther, he must also prove it to St. Ambrose, 
Ambrose writes of a nun who had become a whore, 
so Miritionos shows it on a married nun; that can be a 
coarse ass, who considers whores and pious wives to 
be the same. They also said how pointed and scornful 
the Lutherans at Wittenberg are on them, who scold 
married nuns for whores; pretending that such is 
rather the pope disgraced, than the Luther. And 
showed me how Luther recently let out a booklet in 
which he proves that the pope himself often allowed 
monks and nuns to marry. 

If some nuns are whores, let the pope be the 
cause, teacher, father and patron of such whores. He 
who scolded Luther must also scold the pope; that is 
why Miritionos, with his book, has defiled the pope in 
the highest way; and if he should leave Luther's name 
outside and write to Rome that married nuns are 
whores, the pope should learn to write to him and his 
masters what married nuns are. 

(5) And it seems shameful to me that a nun whom 
the pope marries should be called a pious woman, 
and if others do, she should be called a whore. The 
pope himself misleads us with his dispensations, so 
that | almost do not know who is cook or waiter, 
without realizing that whoever wants to consider the 
pope right is dangerous to attack Luther, because the 
pope himself considers it right to do and to leave what 
Luther teaches to do and to leave. They let me read a 
letter from Wittenberg, in which it was stated that 
Luther has nothing better than that the papists write, 
scold and curse much and confidently against both 
forms and the marriage of the clergy, because he 
speaks: they put him to the trouble of not being 
allowed to write against the pope, they do him a 
service by it, scold their own head and lord, bite and 
devour each other because they do not write anything 
against him that is not also against the pope, their own 
teacher, and laugh at the fine disciples and students 
who thus pay their own master with blasphemy. 

6. neither did they think that the epistle

St. Ambrose was a fine, brave man, because he should 
have written such a clumsy epistle. They also did not like 
to think that it was St. Jerome's epistle, although he is in 
the habit, when he is angry, of judging the beam in other 
people's eyes so sharply, and all the Scriptures that 
speak of Christianity point to physical virgins, and what 
the words of God say about faith, he points with his hair 
to virginity, which is very bad for a Christian teacher. 
Therefore, they consider it to be a heretic's epistle, sold 
under Jerome's name, from the Pelagian or Novatian 
sects. | like it most of all that he rages and rages, not like 
a teacher, but like a devil, over the fall of the flesh, as if 
heaven and earth had collapsed, and should probably 
provoke more despair than repentance. 

(7) Such a teacher should have the devil as 
his disciple, and not a poor sinner or fallen man. After 
all, there is neither measure nor end to the fear, rebuke, 
terror and condemnation, as if he wanted the poor sinner 
or fallen man. 





Whore into the abyss of hell. And on the other hand, 
there is not a comforting word of the forgiveness of sins 
to keep the poor damned conscience from despair. No 
teacher, not even Jerome himself, no matter how angry 
he is, has ever stormed the tenth part against murder, 
even against heresy, or against sin in the Holy Spirit, 
which are a hundred times more serious, as this soul 
murderer storms against a poor female, frail vessel. 

But Miritianus liked it, because he wanted it to be as 
evil as the epistle says; but he looked at things unequally, 
and so shat himself in his art, that we all, splashed with his 
filth, without our fault, must bear the shame with him. So 
we decided in this company that we would let Miritianus 
remain a Miritionos; he may remain so until he becomes 
more humble, and regains the art that he lost in Leipzig 
and with everyone through his arrogance. Greetings to 
your dear housemother and your dear son. Given at Halle,

written to a good friend in Saxony. *). 


What does not concern a congregation of God and 
the Christian church should not be revealed or made 
public, that is, made common, and shouted out 
everywhere like a toothbreaker. For a private matter 
may well be concealed and suppressed, and go up and 
down in its place like the wrath of a house, and not strike 
out at the roof above. But where it happens, it is evil, 
which comes from the devil, who has never been good 
from the beginning. And are 


those who do it, his children, even if they introduce God 
and his word and use them as a cover of shame, as all 
our adversaries have done. My advice is, let it be, and 
learn to endure, and keep your mouth shut, so that the 
noble herb patience may be recognized. May the Lord 
of peace be with you, and your anger will pass away.

Your old man, who has experienced a lot of the thing.

7, complaint of the birds to Luthern about his servant Wolfgang 
Sieberger. *) 


1534. 


To our favorable Lord, Doctori Martino Luthern, 
preacher at Wittenberg. 


We __thrushes, _ blackbirds, finches, _linnets, 
goldfinches, along with other pious, respectable birds, 
who are to travel over Wittenberg this fall, add to your 
love's knowledge, as we are credibly reported, that one, 
named Wolfgang Sieberger, your servant, has taken the 
liberty of a great, unholy thurst, and out of great anger 
and hatred, has bought some old, spoiled nets over us 
at a high price, to create a flock of finches, and not only 
to deprive our dear friends and finches, but also all of us 
of the freedom to fly in the air and to read grains on 
earth, which God has given us, and to put us at risk for 
our life and limb, when we are not at all guilty of anything 
against him, nor do we deserve such a serious and swift 
thurst for him. Because all this, as you can consider 
yourselves, is an annual and great burden for us poor 
free birds (who have neither barns nor houses nor 
anything in them), we humbly and kindly ask you to send 
your servant away from such a thurst, or if that cannot 
be, to keep him so that he scatters grains on the stove 
for us the evening before and does not get up and go to 
the stove before eight o'clock in the morning, so we will 
take our train via Wittenberg. 





If he will not do so, but will thus be wickedly after our 
lives, let us pray to God that he will punish him, and that 
he will feed frogs, grasshoppers and snails in our place 
during the day, and be covered with mice, fleas, lice and 
bugs at night, so that he will forget us and not prevent us 
from flying freely. Why does he not use such anger and 
seriousness against the sparrows, swallows, magpies, 
jackdaws, ravens, mice and rats, which do you much 
harm, steal and rob, and also carry off grain, oats, malt, 
barley, etc. from the houses, which we do not do, but 
only look for the small crumbs and individual ruined 
grains. We put such things to lawful reason, whether we 
are not unjustly pursued so hard by him; but we hope to 
God, because our brothers and friends stayed so much 
this autumn before him and escaped from him, we also 
want to escape from his loose and rotten nets, which we 
saw yesterday. Given in our heavenly seat under the 
trees, under our ordinary seal and feathers. 

Look at the birds of the air: they do not sow, they do 
not reap, they do not gather into the sheds, yet your 
heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more 
than they? Matth. 6, 26.

Prophecies of Luther. 


W.xiv, i3Mf. 789 


8, D, Martin Luther's Prophecy after the Departure of John the Prince, *) 


August 1532. 


1. kings and princes are respected by God, like the 
children of the card game, but a prince dies differently 
than a peasant, and yet they both die the same. 

With Duke Frederick, wisdom died, with Duke 
Hansen, piety died, and now the nobility will rule, when 
wisdom and piety are gone. They know that my young 
lord, Duke John Frederick, has a mind of his own and 
does not care much for pens, which pleases them well; 
he has wisdom enough, so he also has a mind of his 
own, so the nobility will preach courage enough to him. 

If he had half of his cousin's wisdom and half of his 
father's piety, | would grant him half of his mind and wish 
him good luck. 

Our dear Lord God cannot suffer pride and must 
punish evil, for it would be too close to Him if He did not. 
F. must serve. 

5. Denmark is now punished, Venice too; the 
Frankish nobility has also been punished; but if | should 
see our nobility and the nobility of Meissen punished too, 
it would go badly, for they are wise 2c. The peasants and 
the nobility know the gospel better than St. Paul or M. 
Luther; they are wise and think themselves better than 
all their pastors. If they want to despise the priests, they 
despise a greater Lord, who will despise them again, 
and if they want to be their enemy, he will also grab their 
hoods, so that they will feel it and want to defend the 
priests. 





The nobles want to govern, but they can't and they 
don't understand it. The pope understands and knows 
how to govern. The least of the papists knows how to 
govern better than ten nobles in our court. To raise a 
conscience is more than to have a hundred kingdoms 
2c. They blame us for destroying and confusing the 
commonwealths; they do us wrong. But they may see to 
it that they are not prophets over themselves, though we 
do not like to see it. So also the Jews said, If we let this 
man go, the Romans will come; but when they slew 
Christ, did they not come? Thus we shall be confounders 
and spoilers of Germany, when we are gone; for so they 
would have it. 

7 Junker Scharrhans would not be so proud if they 
had not heard that the authority is from God and learned 
this from us; and yet they persecute us. Well, if they drive 
us out, they will not stay long. 


Three things are annoying me in the course of the 
world: 


1. that one does not think of a good supply for a future 
need. 

2. that such untried and imprudent people are needed 
for great offices and dealings. 

3. that in the high sense of government, fidelity and 
infidelity are not rewarded. 





*) This number is a small collection of table speeches, which Aurifaber picked up somewhere and brought into the Eisleben edition, 
Vol. II, Bl. 315d, under the title: Vaticinium Mense Aug. Anno MDXXxXIl post discessum Johannis Electoris ex vita Almost each 
of these pieces asked its side piece in the table speeches, yes, some of them almost from word to word. Thus 8 | of our writing is contained 
in Cap. 45, H 19 of the Table Talks; 88 2 and 3 in Cap. 45, 8 74, para. 4; 8 4 in Cap. 45, 8 38; 8 5 in Cap. 65, 8 4; 86 in Cap. 65, 8 8 2c. (St. 
Louis edition, vol. XXII, cols. 1248. 1277. 1256. 1471.) Aeur 8 6 is Latin with German chunks interspersed; in the remaining pieces there are 
only single Latin words. The Erlangen edition has easily made itself free of this writing by stating in the comparative register with Walch's 
edition, vol. 65, p. 92, that it is written in Latin, while only about the sixth part of it is in Latin. We have translated the Latin writing into German. 
From the Eisleben edition, the writing has passed into the Altenburger, Vol. V, p. 1030 and into the Leipziger, Vol. XXII, p. 583.

In contrast, they say: 
1. one should not be careful for the morning. 
2. grant the vocation. 
3. those who do not act rightly will find their right. 

Meanwhile 

If Satan does not celebrate to make us poorer even in 
the good, poor Manu is oppressed and ruled badly, and 
where the mischievous servant is esteemed equal to the 
faithful one, it chills the pious hearts. 


Conclusion: 
Now, where God and the common man do not go first. 
And so it is in the country, 


That [it] not consider the gentlemen pious. 

And each one watches only for his own house, 
leaving the poor man to be plagued and pressed, 
not even having his back, so it cannot last the 
length of time, and must finally fail. There are 
many examples of this, and it is not necessary to 
speak of them here. 


Prayer. 


O Lord Jesus Christ, who knowest the hearts of both 
parts, save your honor and your truth, that the 
unbelievers may confess that this teaching in our 
churches is your truth, and that you may truly hear our 
churches. Amen. 


9, D, Martin Luther's exhortation to the mayor of Wittenberg to abolish 
the abuse of the churchyard, *) 


1539. 


Dear Mayor! Since the abuse in the churchyard is 
becoming more and more frequent, that everyone lays, 
leads, places, and does his own bidding in it, so that the 
dear dead, who have been baptized in Christ and are 
alive and waiting for the resurrection in your churchyard, 
may not be considered much more than if they were 
resting and sleeping in their beds (as Isaiah Cap. 26), is 
not much more respected than if they were lying on a 
shingle, or not far from the gallows: my request is that, 
since such other abuses are removed, and the dead, 
many of whom have undoubtedly fallen asleep in Christ, 
be given a little greater honor and respect. 





Let rest be granted. For we cannot dig them all up and 
put them away, so that we might give way to such 
abuse; we would do so, too, if it were possible. 
Otherwise it seems as if we think nothing of the dead 
nor of the resurrection of the dead. 

The brewing pans, as before from time immemorial, 
we may well suffer for safety's sake. On the other hand, 
it is too much that even the carpenters do not respect a 
sermon, even bang and bang with their stuff, that no 
word in the sermon should be heard, thinking it is more 
necessary and cheaper to hear a carpenter's axe than 
God's word. Anno 1539.

582 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 64, p. 348. The Latin words form the sixth paragraph of the eightieth chapter in the old editions of the 
Tischreden. In our edition, they are omitted, but reference is made to this passage. They form the conclusion of a verse that was written in 
the 15th century over a picture depicting the pope sitting on his throne and dispensing the so-called graces to those who ask him. (Weim. 
Ausg. Bd. IX, p. 680, note) The presumed time at which Luther wrote the following poem is 1530 during his stay at Coburg or later. (Késtlin 
Il, p. 208.)

set about purifying the German Aesopus, "which had been destroyed by coarse and un-

In these simple fables you will find the very finest 
teaching, warning and instruction (for those who know 
how to use them) on how to conduct oneself in the 
household, in and against the authorities and subjects, 
so that you may live wisely and peacefully among the 
evil people in the false, wicked world. 

2. But that it is attributed to Aesopo is, in my opinion, 
a poem, and perhaps no man on earth was ever called 
Aesopus; But | think it was brought together piece by 
piece through the efforts of many wise people over time, 
and finally put into such order by a scholar, as now in the 
German language some would like to collect the fables 
and proverbs that are in use here, and then someone 
would put them neatly into a book, because such fine 
fables in this book all the world could not invent now, let 
alone a man. Therefore, it is more likely that some of 
these fables were almost old, some even older, but 
some were new at the time this booklet was collected, 
as such fables tend to grow and multiply from year to 
year, according to which one hears and collects from his 
ancestors and parents. 

3 And Quintilianus, the great, sharp master of judging 
books, also thinks that not Aesopus, but the most 
learned one in the Greek language, as Hesiodus or the 
like, is the master of this book; for it seems to him to be 
impossible, as is also reasonable, that such a dolt as 
Aesopus paints and describes should be able to do such 
wit and art as is found in this book and fables, and so 
this book remains an unknown and unnamed master. 
And indeed, it praises and extols itself higher than it 
could extol no master's name. 

4 However, those who have invented Aesopum as a 
master, and have made his life known to the world, may 
be the best. 





795 


may have had reason enough, namely, that they, as the 
wise people, would have liked to make such a book 
common to everyone for the sake of common benefit (for 
we see that the young children and young people are 
easily moved by fables and fairy tales), and thus [the 
people] 1) would be led with pleasure and love to art and 
wisdom, which pleasure and love become all the greater 
when an Aesopus or such larva or carnival finery 2) is 
presented, who talks out or presents such art, so that 
they notice it all the more, and immediately accept and 
retain it with laughter. Not only the children, but also the 
great princes and lords cannot be deceived very much, 
for the truth and for their benefit, because one lets the 
fools tell them the truth, which they can suffer and hear, 
otherwise they do not want to or cannot suffer the truth 
from any wise man, yes, all the world hates the truth 
when it hits one. 

Therefore such wise, high people have invented the 
fables, and let one animal talk to another, as if they 
should say: Well, no one wants to hear the truth nor 
suffer, and one can not do without the truth, so we want 
to decorate it and dress it under a funny lie color and 
lovely fable, and because one does not want to hear it 
through the mouth of man, that one hears it through the 
mouth of animals and beasts. Thus it happens, when one 
reads the fables, that one animal tells the truth to 
another, one wolf to another; yes, sometimes the painted 
wolf or bear or lion in the book secretly reads a good text 
to the right bipedal wolf and lion, which otherwise no 
preacher, friend or foe would be allowed to read to him. 
So also a painted fox in the

He "made thirteen ("sixteen" in Mathesius is the result of a printing error in the Wittenberg edition, which has also passed into the Jena 
edition) beautiful fables, which are full of wisdom, good teaching and polite admonition. Even later, he did not find time to translate all of 
Aesop's fables, "although Melanchthon is said to have promised him (Késtlin, M. Luther (Z), Vol. Il, p. 206) that he would pay him a thousand 
guilders from a high lord to whom he might give the booklet". The preface may have been written by him already at that time, but we only 
know that for sure, that he read it to his friends on November 6, 1538 (cf. Tischreden, Cap. 73, Z9, St. Louis edition, vol. XXII, 1565). Recently, 
the manuscript of our writing was found in the library of the Vaticans and published: E. Thiele, "Hallesche Neudrucke", Heft 76, 1888. In print, 
it first appeared in the Wittenberg edition. There it is found (1569) vol. IX, p. 454d; in the Jenaer (1566), vol. V, p. 268d; in the Altenburger, 
vol. V p. 403; in the Leipziger, vol. XXII, appendix, p. 61 and in the Erlanger, vol. 64, p. 349. We give the text after the Wittenberger. 


796 Erl. 64, 352-354. 


Book, if one reads the fable, should 1) probably address 
a fox over the table so that the sweat wants to break out, 
and should probably want to stab or burn the Aesopum. 
As the poet of Aesopi indicates that Aesopus, too, was 
killed for the sake of truth, and ihu did not help that he, 
in fables, as a fool, in addition a fictitious Aesopus, let 
the animals speak such truth, because truth is the most 
unpleasant thing on earth. 

For this reason we have undertaken to sweep this 
book and to give it a little better form than it has had up 
to now, mostly for the sake of the youth, so that they may 
learn such fine teachings and warnings under the lovely 
form of fables, as ina mummery or game, and keep them 
all the better. For we have seen what a clumsy book they 
have made of the Aesopo, who have given the German 
Aesopum that exists, which would be well worthy of a 
great punishment, as they not only made such a finely 
useful book to shame and useless, but also added much 
addition from their head; although this would still have to 
suffer. 

(7) Such disgraceful, lewd knavery is mixed into it that 
no virtuous, pious person can suffer it, nor can any 
young person read or hear it without harm, just as if they 
had put a book into the common women's house or 
otherwise among loose knaves, because they did not 
seek benefit and art in the fables, but only made a 
pastime and laughter out of them, just as if the wise 
people had directed their faithful, great diligence to it, so 
that such frivolous people should make a babble and 
fool's work out of their wisdom. They are sows and 
remain sows, before whom one should not cast pearls. 

Therefore we ask all pious hearts to eradicate the 
same German disgraceful Aesopum, and to use this in 
its place; one can nevertheless be cheerful, and act such 
fables in the evening over the table with children and 
servants in a useful and merry way, so that one may not 
be so shameful 2) and unreasonable, as in the lewd 
taverns and taverns; for we have done our diligence.

have to bring vain fine, pure, useful fables into a book, in 
addition the Legend Aesopi. 

(9) What are otherwise useful and not harmful fables, we 
also want to purify and sweep in time, God willing, so 
that it becomes a funny and lovely, yet respectable and 
chaste and useful Aesopus, which one could laugh at 
and use without sin to warn and instruct children and 
servants on their future life and conduct, therefore it was 
invented and made from the beginning. 

(10) And that | hasten to give examples of the good use 
of fables, when a householder wants to have 
amusement over the table that is useful, he can ask his 
wife, child, and servants, What is the meaning of this 
fable or that fable? and both of them and themselves 
practice it. The fifth fable, about the dog with the piece 
of meat in its mouth, means that if a servant or maid is 
too well and wants to improve, he or she, like the dog, 
loses the good and does not get the better. Item, if one 
servant is attached to the other and allows himself to be 
seduced, so that he is like the frog tied to the man in the 
third fable, which the consecration ate both of them, and 
so from then on in the other fables with love, with sorrow, 
with troubles and curls, as one is able, without us having 
to do our part with them. 


I. Thorheit. 


From the rooster and pearls. 

A cock scratched on the manure, and found a precious 
pearl; when he saw it lying in the dung, he said: "See, 
you, his dinglein, lie here so miserable, if a merchant 
found you, he would be happy, and you would come to 
great honors, but you are of no use to me, and | to you, 
| take a grain or a worm, and leave all the pearls to you; 
you may stay as you lie. 


Teaching. 
This fable teaches that this booklet is worthless among 
peasants and coarse people, as all art and wisdom is 
despised among them, as one says: Art goes after 
bread; but it warns that one should not despise the 
teaching.

II. Hatred. 


Of the wolf and the little lamb. 


A wolf and a little lamb came to a brook to drink; the 
wolf drank at the top of the brook, but the little lamb drank 
far below. When the wolf saw the little lamb, 1) he ran to 
it and said, "Why are you muddying my water so that | 
cannot drink? And the little lamb answered, How can | 
muddy thy water, seeing thou drinkest above me, and wilt 
muddy it for me? The wolf said: How? do you curse me 
in addition? The little lamb answered: | do not curse thee. 
The wolf said, "Yes, your father did the same to me six 
months ago, you want to curse. 2) The little lamb 
answered, If | was not born then, how shall | repay my 
father? The wolf said, "But you have gnawed and ruined 
my meadows and fields. The little lamb answered, "How 
is that possible, for | have no teeth yet? Well, said the 
wolf, and even if you can talk a lot and blabber, | still won't 
stay gnawed; and so he strangled the innocent little lamb 
and ate it. 


Teaching. 


The course of the world is: He who wants to be pious 
must suffer, if one should break a thing from the old 
fence, because violence goes for right. If one wants to the 
dog, then he has eaten the leather; if the wolf wants, then 
the lamb is wrong. 


III Infidelity. 


From the frog and the mouse. 


A mouse would have liked to cross a water, but could 
not, and asked a frog for advice and help. The frog was a 
mischievous one, and said to the mouse, "Tie your foot 
to my foot, and | will swim and pull you across. But when 
they came to the water, the frog dived down and wanted 
to drown the mouse; but the mouse resisted, and

799 


a harrier flies along and catches the mouse, takes the 
frog out too, and eats them both. 
Teaching. 

Beware with whom you deal, the world is false and 
full of infidelity, for whichever friend is able to put another 
in sackcloth; but infidelity always strikes its own master, 
as happens to the frog here. 


IV. Envy. 
From dogs and sheep. 


The dog approached a sheep in court for bread that 
he had lent him. But since the sheep denied, the dog 
appealed to witnesses, who had to be admitted. The first 
witness was the wolf, who spoke: | know that the dog 
lent bread to the sheep; the harrier said: | have been 
there; the vulture said to the sheep: How may you deny 
it so insolently? So the sheep lost its business, and had 
to attack its wool at the wrong time to pay for the bread 
it did not owe. 


Teaching. 
Beware of evil neighbors, or be patient if you want to 
live with people. For no one begrudges another anything 
good; that is the way of the world. 


V. Stinginess. 


From dogs in the water. 


A dog was running through a stream of water and had 
a piece of meat in its mouth, but when it saw the shine 
of the meat in the water, it thought it was also meat and 
grabbed it greedily. But when he opened his mouth, the 
piece of meat fell out of his mouth, and the water carried 
it away; so he lost both the meat and the shadows. 

Teaching. 

One should be content with what God gives. 3) He 
who spurns the little does not get the greater; he who 
wants too much keeps nothing in the end; some lose the 
certain over the uncertain.

VI. sacrilege. Violence. 


An ox, a goat and a sheep joined the lion and 
went hunting together in a forest. When they had 
caught a stag and divided it into four equal parts, 
the lion said: "You know that one part is mine, as 
your companion, the other is mine, as a king 
among the animals, the third I want because I am 
stronger and have run and worked harder for it 
than all three of you; but whoever wants the fourth 
must take it from me by force. So the three had to 
pay for their efforts and the damage. 


Teaching. 

Don't go high, stick to your own kind. Dulcis 
inexpertis cultura potentis amici. It is not good to eat 
cherries with gentlemen, they throw you with the 
stalks. Ulpian. L. Si non fuerint. This is a society 
with the lion, where one alone has the enjoyment, 
the other alone the damage. 


VII This fable is presented in a different way. 

A lion, a fox and a donkey were hunting 
together and caught a deer, so the lion told the 
donkey to divide the venison. The donkey made 
three parts; therefore the lion was angry, and tore 
the skin over the donkey's head, so that he stood 
there bloodied, and told the fox to divide the 
venison. The fox pushed the three parts together 
and gave them to the lion. The lion laughed and 
said, "Who taught you to divide like that? The fox 
pointed to the donkey and said, "The doctor in the 
red beret. 


This fable teaches two pieces: 


The first: gentlemen want to have advantage, 
and one should not eat cherries with gentlemen, 
they throw one with the stalks; the other: Felix 
quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum. He is a wise 
man who can improve on another's accident. 


VII. 
From the thief. 


Once upon a time a thief was free, and his 
neighbors were merry at his wedding, for 


They hoped that he would become pious. Then a 
wise man came along, and when he saw them in 
joy, he said: "Watch out, do not be too happy, the 
sun also wants to be free once, which frightened 
the whole world, and became so impatient that 
they also cursed and scolded the heavens. Jupiter 
asked from the sky: "What does the cursing 
mean? Then all the world said, "We now have a 
single sun, and it is doing us so much harm with 
its heat that we are almost all perishing; what will 
happen when the sun begets more suns? 
This fable shows the world: 

You can't paint the devil over the door. 

Gries likes to beat after gramen, 1) One 
thief begets another. 

Help pious people multiply, Otherwise 
the wicked are too many. 

Many a rogue is encouraged by pious people, 
who then has his equal in him. It is very harmful 
to land and people, so beware of whom you 
should advise or help; bread is lost on strange 
children and dogs. 


IX. 


From the crane and Wolfe. 


Once the wolf ate a sheep miserly, and one of 
his legs got stuck in his throat. He was in great 
distress and fear, and offered to give a great 
reward and gift to anyone who would help him. 
Then the crane came and pushed his long collar 
into the wolf's throat and pulled out the leg. When 
he asked for the promised reward, the wolf said, 
"Do you still want a reward? Thank God that I did 
not bite off your neck; you should give me a gift 
for coming out of my boat alive. 


This fable shows: 

He who wants to do good to the people of the 
world must consider earning ingratitude; the 
world is not worthwhile in any other way than 
with ingratitude, as the saying goes: "He who 
delivers one from the gallows is gladly helped by 
him. 


1) Dietz explains this by: "kind does not let of kind." - "to look 
up".is: to re-specify. 


802 Erl. 64, 358-361. 


X. 
From dog and bitch. 


A pregnant bitch asked a dog with humble words that 
he would grant her his house stone until she had littered; 
the dog did so gladly. Now that the young dogs were 
growing up, the dog wanted his house stone again, but 
the bitch did not want it; at last the dog threatened her 
and told her to leave the house. Then the bitch was angry 
and said: "If you are bad, then bite us out. 


This fable shows: 

When the louse gets into trouble, he makes a mess 
of himself; see how you get rid of evil when it gets the 
upper hand. The devil is a good guest to ask, but you 
can't get rid of him. 


XI. 


Of the donkey and the lion. 


The donkey was also once a peasant, and when he 
met a lion, he greeted him mockingly and said: | greet 
you, brother. The lion was annoyed by the mocking 
greeting, but thought to himself: Why should | take 
revenge on this rascal? | scold him or tear him apart, so 
I, no honor put in: | will let the fool go.

XII. Fable. 


From the city and field mouse. 


A city mouse went for a walk, and came to a field mouse, 
which did him good, with acorns, barley, nuts, and 
whatever he could. But the city mouse said: You are a 
poor mouse; why do you want to live here in poverty? 
Come with me, | will provide enough for you and me, of 
all kinds of delicious food. The field mouse went with her 
to a beautiful house where the city mouse lived, and they 
went to the

Kemnoten, there was full of bread, meat, bacon, 
sausages, cheese and everything; then the city mouse 
said: Now eat and be good, such food | have daily 
superfluous. Meanwhile the waiter came, and rumbled 
with the keys at the door, the mice were frightened and 
ran away; the city mouse soon found his hole, but the 
field mouse knew nowhere to go, ran up and down the 
wall, and had considered his life. 

When the waiter had gone out again, the city mouse 
said: "There is no need now, let us be good. The field 
mouse answered: "You have said well, you knew how to 
make your hole, meanwhile | almost died of fear. | will 
tell you what the opinion is: You remain a rich city mouse 
and eat sausages and bacon, | will remain a poor little 
field mouse and eat my acorns. You are not safe for a 
moment from the waiter, from the cats, from so many 
mouse traps, and the whole house is hostile to you; | am 
free and safe in my poor little field mouse.

XII. 


Of the raven and the fox. 


A raven had stolen a cheese, and sat down on a high 
tree, and wanted to eat; but when he, according to his 
kind, cannot be silent when he eats, a fox heard him over 
the cheese, and read and said: O rah, now | have not 
seen [a] more beautiful bird of feathers and shape than 
you are in my life. If you had such a beautiful voice to 
sing, you should be crowned king over all birds. 

The raven was tickled by such praise and flattery, 
began to let his beautiful song be heard, and when he 
opened his beak, the cheese fell from him, the fox took 
it nimbly, ate it, and laughed at the foolish raven. 

Beware when the fox praises the raven, Beware of 

flatterers, so flay and scrape 2c.

Testament.

Obadiah to Malachi. 


H. D. Martin Luther's interpretation of the prophet Obadiah. 


1, Luther's lectures on the prophet Obadiah, 


according to the Altenburg manuscript. *) 


Held in January 1525; printed in V. Dietrich's adaptation 1536; after the Altenburg manuscript 1884. 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


The commentators are not unanimous about the time 
when the prophet Obadiah prophesied. They have 
different opinions about it, 1) because in the beginning 
of his prophecy he did not specify the time and the king 
under whom he prophesied, which 2) can be seen in the 
books of some prophets. Jerome says that it was this 
Obadiah who fed the hundred prophets in the caves 
under the godless Ahab and Jezebel, as it is written in 
the first 3) book of Kings, [Cap. 18, 4.], and therefore the 
gift of prophecy was given to him. But this is similar to 
the dreams of old women, as also most other things of 
Jerome, when he judges from his own head about holy 
things. The Jews judge differently in their interpretations. 
|, however, am completely in favor of the fact that he, 
after 4) the Babyloni- 


1) D. begins thus: It is not certain at what time Obadiah prophesied, 
since he 2c. 

2) D. continues: what the others generally tend to do. 

3) In our submission: 4th RsZurn. 

4) D.: "at the time of" 2c. This, however, has been in the 
manuscript, but crossed out and replaced by our reading. 


He prophesied already in captivity and took his prophecy 
from Jeremiah, 5) which is indicated by several 
passages in this prophet, 6) and certain circumstances 
prove that he was a contemporary of Jeremiah. But he 
directed his prophecy 7) against the Edomites, who 
rejoiced and took the greatest pleasure in the desolation 
and removal of the Jews at the time of the Babylonian 
captivity. This may be seen in the 137th Psalm [v. 7.], 
"Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day 
of Jerusalem, who say, Pure off, pure off, unto their 
ground." That is, Remember, O LORD, and avenge that 
mockery of the Edomites with which they mocked thy 
people in the time of adversity, when they were led away 
captive; remember how they were then when Jerusalem 
was disturbed. This is 


5) D. f: especially from the 49th chapter. 

6) D. continues: These not dark circumstances prove that 2c. 

7) D.: so arranged: first, that he might comfort Judah, which was 
carried away captive to Babylon, for it would come to pass that it 
would be brought back to Jerusalem; then that he might prophesy 
against the Edomites*) 2c.

*) Also this prophet we give again after the Altenburger manuscript with addition of the more important deviations of Dietrich in notes, 
and also here we refer to the first note to the first relation of the prophet Joel, which gives information about everything, which concerns also 
this writing. According to the Altenburg manuscript it is first printed in the Erlangen edition, opp., tora. XXV, p. 509 and (with many 
improvements) in the Weimar one, vol. XIII, p. 215. Veit Dietrich's adaptation is found in the Latin Wittenberg edition (1552), tom. IV, toi. 530 
and in the Jena edition (1603), tom. Ill, toi. 518. The same was translated into German in 1555 by 21 Stephan Agricola, preacher at Hof in 
the Vogtland and subsequently at Merseburg, and first appeared in the German Wittenberg edition (1556), vol. VIII, p. 441; subsequently in 
the Altenburg, vol. VI, p. 1036; in the Leipzig, vol. VIII, p. 309 and in Walch, vol. VI, 2568. At the end of the Altenburg manuscript is written:

remnant of Ephraim, Israel are to flourish 2c. 2) And so 
the transition will not seem hard, and everything will 
agree quite well with each other, which otherwise is quite 
hard with other interpreters. 


Thus says the Lord GOD of Edom: "We have heard 
from the Lord that a message has been sent to the 
nations. 


He uses images taken from warfare to frighten the 
Edomites and make their future misfortune great. But 
this image is taken from the way in warfare, where 
envoys are sent for great matters, 3) which divided 
friends tend to get along with each other, as if he wanted 
to say: The other kings and princes settle their matters 
through their envoys, but | accomplish them through 
myself, through my spirit. 


Come, and let us fight against them. 
These are the words of the messenger by which he 


will hardly appear as a fly compared to them, and they 
will despise you against themselves and consider you as 
nothing; they will devour you, so that you shall be nothing 
anymore. 


V. 3. The pride of your heart has deceived you. 


He adds the reason why he wants to expose the 
Edomites to ridicule and hand them over to the enemy 
army for destruction: because, he says, you are so 
perfectly at ease in. your opinion and in your powers, 
puffing yourself up, not distrusting your things, as he also 
adds: 


Because you live in the crevices of the rocks. 


He shows the cause of this arrogance, namely the 
well-fortified country, the cities and castles 4) move them 
to be so hopeful. For it is also known from Moses that this 
land of the Edomites is mountainous, as Deut. 2:3, 4:

Hope | will snatch from you. But he alludes in Hebrew to 
the famous city of Petra, as if to say, "You have a royal 
and strongly fortified city, namely, a rock in whose clefts 
you think you will be safe; but your hope will deceive you, 
for so much is lacking for you to be safe in these clefts 
of the rock that even in the most hidden places, indeed, 
in your whole country, you will not be able to hide 
yourself from the army that will come against you. - 


Exaltasti sedem [you have made your dwelling high], 
that is, you have fortified castles in the mountains. 


Who wants to push me to the ground? 


He describes their arrogance 1) and their pomposity 
and their confidence in their powers, namely that they 
did not trust high in the help and protection of the Lord, 
but in their fortifications and rocks. But listen, he says, 
however much you may be fortified by your powers and 
fortifications, yet | will snatch away all hope from you, 
you shall be made nothing at all, so much so that 


V. 4. if thou shalt soar like an eagle, and make thy

So even the Almighty GOD 2) cannot suffer our 
confidence in ourselves; he hates the carnal confidence, 
pride and pomposity of ungodly hearts, as is seen 
everywhere in all Scripture, that he turns us away from 
the carnal arm, from trusting in ourselves, so that we 
should hope in him; then we would be safe 2c.

you by night.

wish that thieves and robbers have a

2) The following in this passage reads with D.: the hopefulness 
and presumption not suffer, that there is no such great power, which 
he should not overthrow, if men blow themselves out with it. But these 
passages teach us about the fear of God against the security and 
presumption of godless hearts 2c. 

3) Instead of this paragraph and the first sentence of the following, 
D.: | would prefer that this s instead of as an assumed case: si kures

They have invaded your land and taken the spoils from

steal everything), than that | should come against you, 
who will search everything and also search the most 
hidden things in all the caves of the mountains, so that 
nothing will be left for you, so that everything will perish 
and all of you will also perish at the same time. 


How are you supposed to come to naught like that. 


This verb is used in many ways in the Scriptures, and 
the commentators have also rendered it in many ways. 
It is in the fourth chapter of Hosea [v. 5, Vulg.], "I have 
made thy mother silent." And in the 49th Psalm [v. 13. 
21.], "When a man is in dignity, and hath no 
understanding, he leadeth away as cattle." Likewise, Ps. 
4, 5: "Speak with your heart in your camp, and wait" But 
it really means: to silence something and make it 
nothing, to destroy a kingdom or a people in such a way 
that hardly any traces of it are to be seen, that they must 
be silent and not dare to murmur 2c., as the Germans 
say of someone who has become wise through his 
harm: "He has become so finely silent." Here it is entirely 
the same opinion, as if he wanted to say, "Well, | will 
make you fine small, you shall become quite quiet." For 
this thy calamity, when | come against thee with my 
army, shall be such that the injuries of thieves and 
robbers, however great they may be, shall not be 
considered injuries or robberies in comparison. 4) You 
would have wished 


| will be read in a wise (atkrinntive) way: If by night thieves and 
spoilers shall come against thee, how much shalt thou be spoiled! for 
they shall steal enough*). 2c. But he calls the Chaldeans thieves, 
because they robbed Edom, like a thief by night, though they were 
thieves in truth before God, being no better than the Edomites. For it 
usually happens that one thief attacks and punishes another, one 
robber another, one murderer another. Furthermore, the word which 
the prophet uses here, and which the Latin translates by 
o,onti6ui8868 , has been rendered by the commentators in various 
ways. It is written in the 4th chapter 2c. 
4) The following sentence is missing from D. 


*) In all editions tirmavuntur instead of niruvuntur. In the Vulgate: 
novue turuti "gsent? which Luther wants sLrrnutivv rendered by 
turuvuutur.

that you would be attacked and overpowered by thieves, 
but this is not to be compared with the destruction when 
| come 2c. For | will not leave thee a berry; all that is 
hidden will | draw out, whether it be money or men, which 
thou hadst hoped to obtain. So nothing will get away 
when | devastate. 


V. 7 All your own covenanters will push you out to 
the land (usque ad terminum emiserunt). 


It is the same expression that is found in Isa. 5, 8: 
"They will bring one field to another until there is no more 


room" (usque ad terminum loci). Hence the opinion: 
They will drive you out and push you out to the borders 
or ends of your land; they will throw you out of your land 
altogether, so that you will have no more borders. 


The people on whom you place your comfort will 
betray you. 


He takes away all their confidence: there will be 
nothing they can rely on when the devastation comes, 
that not only the most fortified cities and castles will be of 
no use, but also the neighboring nations allied with them 
will betray them and not stand by the alliance. 


Before you know it. 


Non est prudentia, that is what we say in German: 
"You fool, you do not realize", you do not realize that you 
trust in vain in a carnal arm, because it will be a cane for 
you; if you lean on it, you will fall. No wisdom, no counsel, 
no strength will avail thee; | will also make fools of thy 
wise men, so that those in whom thou hast confidence 
that they will stand on thy side will change their mind and 
set themselves against thee. This is what Ezekiel says, 
Cap. 23:22: "Behold, | will raise up against thee thy 
lovers, of whom thou art weary, and | will bring them 
against thee round about. "2c. And Jer. 30, 14: "All thy 
lovers forget thee" 2c. Exactly the same thing happened 
to those at Constantinople: since they had 


815 


1) they became tributary to him shortly thereafter. In our 
times it often happened with the emperor and the pope 
that, while the emperor was confident that the pope 
would keep it with him, because an alliance had been 
concluded, when it came to the meeting, the pope 
changed his mind and opposed the emperor. 2c. The 
same thing happened to the Jews when they sought the 
friendship of the Romans and thought that they would be 
victorious against all the Gentiles: those whom they had 
sought as helpers they soon invented as their masters. 
And this is what the Latins very finely say: one must seek 
friends among one's equals, and beware of those who 
are more powerful. 


V. 8: At that time | will destroy the wise men of 
Edom and the prudent men of Esau. 


He threatens that he will not only take away the 
external protection, weapons, force and fortifications, so 
that they cannot be safe, but also the wise men who 
would help with advice in these troubles. For this land 
had wise 2) and prudent men, as Esau also was, but all 
these, he says, he will make fools and destroy. Here 
belong many passages that are found from time to time 
in the holy scriptures about the condemnation of human 
wisdom and carnal counsel. In the 107th Psalm it says, 
v. 27: "They staggered and swayed like a drunken man, 
and knew no more counsel." And Ps. 33, 10: "The Lord 
makes void the counsel of the Gentiles." The flesh 
cannot help itself by its counsel and wisdom in times of 
trouble. 


V. 9. for your strong ones in Theman shall tremble. 


Instead of timebunt it should more correctly read: 


Thy strong ones shall tremble (pavidi erunt), "become 
fugitive and timid". For he be-

actually denotes the despondency that befalls an army 
that is to be cut down in war, namely when they do not 
see how they can escape. And what in our [Latin] 


translation is rendered by an appellative [namely a 


meridie] should be read as a proper name: "to 
Theman". For so he calls this country, to which the 
grandson of Esau, Theman, had attached the name 
Theman after his name (as princes and kings sometimes 
are wont to do). He is remembered in the first book of 
Moses [Cap. 36, 11, 15, 42]. 


That they may all be cut off in the mountain of Esau 
by the murder. 


In Hebrew it is [sttatt ut intereat]: by slaughtering 2c. 
| will thus see to it that the people of the mountain Esau 
are exterminated, so that no one remains. By the way, it 
is far more expressive in Hebrew, so that it cannot well 
be translated into another language, as if he wanted to 
say: "There will be a mob here and a mob there"; 
everywhere in the cities they will be killed, if some want 
to resist, and your wise men will be so frightened by this 
miserable murder, 1) that they will lose their minds 
completely 2c. 


V. ii. At the time when you stood against him. 


This is the reason why he is so angry with them. And 
from this it is clear what | said at the beginning of this 
chapter about the time of the prophet, that he 
prophesied about the time of the Babylonian captivity. 


Since the strangers led away his army captive. 2) 


"His army", more correctly: his goods and chattels. 
And this passage moves me to think that this prophet 
worked at the time of the Babylonian captivity, because 
Jerusalem was never conquered before that captivity by 
the Chaldeans. 


1) In our template: eonterrentur. D.: oonterrekuntur. The Weimar 
edition suggests aonterentnr. Both readings amount to the same 
thing, but D.'s reading is confirmed by the Zwickau manuscript. 

2) According to the Vulgate. 


V. 12. You shall no longer see your lust like this. 


Instead of: Et non despicies, the Hebrew reads: 
Therefore you shall not see. But this Hebrew word does 
not mean merely "see", but what we say in German: 
"Thou shalt no more see thy lust", thou shalt no more 
tickle thyself with thy brother's misfortune. 


And thou shalt not speak with thy mouth so proudly 
in the time of their fear. 

You shall no longer mock him in the time of tribulation, 
since the hailstorm of calamity will fall on you as well. 


At the time of their wailing (in die perditionis). 


There are only two words here in Hebrew, but the 
Latin interpreter, who has taken pleasure in a variety 


(copia) not well placed, translates it soon by perdition, 
soon by fear, soon by doom 2c. 3) 


v. 14. You shall not stand at the crossroads (Et non 
stabis in exitibus). 


The Hebrew word means both: deliverance and 
desolation, as can be seen from the 50th 4) Psalm, v. 
22.: "That | should not even be carried away, and there 
should be no more savior." So also here both can be 
understood. But the meaning is: You, Edom, were not 
satisfied with robbing your brother, with snatching his 
possessions from him, since you were sent against him 
according to my decree with the rest of the heathen, but 
you also stopped and hindered those who wanted to 
save themselves by fleeing, and were pleased that those 
who were thus stopped were killed. 


You shall not betray his others (Non concludes). 


That is, you oppressed and harassed those who could 
not escape, so that they would all be killed. 5)

V. 16. For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain. 


He threatens all the Gentiles with desolation, as if to 
say: | will boil you and all other Gentiles into one another; 
you shall be devastated together as you devastated my 
people. You have devoured and drunk my goods in my 
sanctuary, but | will make other nations in turn consume 
and devour all that is yours. Thus, after His miraculous 
judgment, the Almighty God always punishes the old 
sins of any kingdom through the new sins of some whom 
He awakens, as we see here. It was the Gentiles who 
sinned, who miserably afflicted the people of God. Here 
the Lord threatens vengeance for this sin: it will happen 
that other Gentiles will come against these robbers, and 
so that old sin will be punished by a new one. Thus the 
Tartars and the Goths came with new sins against the 
old sins of the Romans, which had oppressed the people 
of the Jews in an extraordinary way. Nowadays the Turk 
is powerful, but if the world will not perish soon, a 
stronger one will come who, awakened by God's 
judgment, will subdue the Turk 2c. Up to here the first 
part of this prophecy goes from the threat of the 
destruction of the Edomites by other pagans, 2) under 
which | understand the Romans. 


V. 17. But on Mount Zion some shall yet be saved. 


This is the last part of this prophecy, in which, after 
the Jews are led into captivity and the Edomites are 
again disturbed, who had mocked the Jews, he promises 
another kingdom, which cannot be understood 
differently than the spiritual kingdom of Christ, which has 
been made manifest among all Gentiles through the 
gospel. 3) The Jewish people was divided into two 
kingdoms, the kingdom of Israel, which was 


1) D.: N160 instead of: Miro. 
2) The following words are missing from D., 
3) D.: propnMtunl instead of: propalatruD in the manuscript. 





The kingdom of Judah, which is transformed into the 
kingdom of Christ, should never be restored after it has 
been disturbed. It is most necessary that those know this 
who read the prophets, in whose books these two 
kingdoms are frequently mentioned. And so it is 
important to know that the prophet is speaking here of 
the spiritual kingdom of Christ, which even the letter 
compels us to believe, because he says: 


The house of Jacob shall possess its possessors, he 
indicates, that the house of Jacob shall regain for itself 
a kingdom and spread out, and subdue those whose 
dominion it has previously suffered. This is indicated by 
the word in Hebrew which our interpreter has given by 


the word possidere, but he has not rendered the 
meaning of the Hebrew word, for it actually denotes what 
the Germans express by the word "to take." 4) This so 
glorious word can fit neither to the external kingdom of 
Judah nor to Israel, since the Israelite kingdom was 
never to be restored, which is quite clear from the sacred 
histories. Therefore, this contradiction forces us to 
understand it as referring to the spiritual kingdom of 
Christ, namely, that apostles and other disciples of 
Christ would come from the Israelite people, who, 
through the new preaching of the Gospel, would subdue 
the whole world and thus establish a new and eternal 
kingdom. And this is what he says: 

On Mount Zion there will be an escape or a new 
salvation, that is, to Zion such a sermon will go out, 
which, if believed, will deliver from death, from sin and 
from hell. And this sermon would first come from Zion, 
as also Isaiah Cap. 2, 3. says: "From Zion shall go forth 
the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem." And 
Joel 3, 5: "At Jerusalem there will be salvation. 5) 


4) Here D. continues like this: But because he connects the 
kingdom of Judah with the kingdom of Joseph or Israel, which has 
never been restored, and says that both shall regain their former 
power, this contradiction forces us 2c. 

5) D.B: And in the 110th Psalm, v. 2.: "The LORD Will send the 
scepter of Your kingdom out of Zion."

They are supposed to be sanctuary. 
That is, they will no longer be able to be defiled by the 
Gentiles as happened before. 1) 


; V. 18. And the house of Jacob shall become a fire 
C. 

With this general subjugation of all Gentiles, he says, 
also the Edomites shall be subjugated to this kingdom. 
All this is inconsistent and contradicts the history, if we 
wanted to understand a physical subjugation. For what 
rhymes less than that the house of Jacob shall be a fire, 
and the house of Joseph a flame, 2) and that Hans 
Esau, that is, the Edomites, shall be straw to be 
consumed by the flame? Moreover, the house of Joseph 
never returned after the Assyrian 3) captivity, nor did the 
house of Judah ever possess the Edomites. Finally, it is 
the most strange thing that he, after having prophesied 
before that all Edomites should perish and be made 
nothing, should finally say here that they should also be 
consumed by fire. Therefore, this absolutely compels us 
to understand it of the preaching of the gospel by the 
apostles and by other disciples from Israel among all the 
Gentiles. By this preaching they consumed them, that 
is, they spiritually incorporated them into the kingdom of 
Christ, so that they could no longer be torn out of Christ's 
hand, as Christ says in the Gospel [John 10:28]. For 
when the gospel has been accepted in truth, Satan does 
not easily retain the upper hand. This is what happened, 
as history testifies. For the stony Arabia, where the 
Edomites were, was a place of holy people before 
others, according to the revelation of the gospel; 4) there 
was St. Anthony and several other holy fathers. 


1) D. 1: because forgiveness of sins is brought through the gospel. 
Where this is, no sins can harm, no condemnation can harm. 
Moreover, they have the Holy Spirit, who in the saints daily kills the 
flesh and drives to holy works. 

2) D. t: which was, as it were, already reduced to ashes, 3) In all 

expenditures, however, is 
oava to read, because the house of Joseph is the kingdom of Israel, 


which was never in Babylonian captivity. ; 
4) Instead of the following D. has: what also Isaiah promises. 


That nothing may remain for the house of Esau. 


He will so subdue the house of Esau that not even a 
remnant will remain; there will be nothing that could be 
against this kingdom of Christ. For through the gospel 
Christians become masters of all creatures. This is what 
is said about the power and effectiveness of the 
preaching of the gospel among the Gentiles. 


v. 19. And they that are toward the south shall 
possess the mountain of Esau 2c. 


Here is an extraordinary contradiction, if nian wants 
to take it according to the letter and understand any 
external kingdom. First, he says: they [those at noon] 
shall possess; then [v. 20]: they shall be possessed. 5) 
The kingdom of Israel was divided into twelve tribes and 
was diligently warned by the law of Moses that the tribes 
should not be mixed with one another, which can be 
seen in Moses. Since he now clearly says here that 
those who dwell toward the south, that is, those who 
dwell toward the south, are to possess the mountain 
Esan 2c., 6) it must be understood quite differently than 
the letter reads. Therefore the opinion is: The Christians, 
the apostles and other disciples, who will be at noon, 
namely on the mountain Zion, on which the gospel is 
preached first, these, | say, will create fruit with the 
Edomites by their preaching. 


And the reasons will possess the Philistines. 
(Instead of campestria should be read more correctly 


humilia, the lovely 7) valleys between the mountains, 
"the reasons"). This never happened physically after the 
Babylonian captivity. Because also the whole kingdom 
could not overcome the Philistines and make itself 
subservient. Therefore, it must be understood from the 
spiritual subjugation through the Gospel. 


5) D. t: Likewise, "Those in reasons will possess the Philistines." 
Furthermore, which is the greatest, the kingdom of Israel 2c. 

6) Instead of "rc. has D.: Likewise: "Benjamin will possess Gilead", 
contrary to how") according to God's command the land was divided 
by Moses and Joshua 2c. 

7) Instead of nmoeni in the manuscript will have to be read with

Yes, they will possess the field of Ephraim. 


This is also against the law. Therefore this was done by 
the apostles when they went to Samaria to preach the 
gospel. 1) Likewise also that which follows: 


Benjamin will possess the mountain range of Gilead. 
Benjamin is on this side of the Jordan, but Gilead is on 
the other side of the Jordan in the tribe of Gad. Therefore, 
the necessity forces us to relate everything to the 
preaching of the Gospel. 


V. 20. And the exiles of this army of the children of 
Israel 2c. 
But this is even more inconsistent than the preceding, 
namely that they should possess the whole land of the 
Cananites, 2) who nevertheless were led into captivity 
and never returned. What can be said more inconsistent 
than this, looking only at the letter? The same is what 
follows of the exiles of the city of Jerusalem, that is, the 
captives from Israel would possess the cities of the 
south, that is, the cities located around Jerusalem and in 
Edom. 


As far as Zarpath.

tiu the Jews to Bosporus in Thrace, and that they expect 
to set up the kingdom again in that place, and | do not 
know what other little things; but the good man is 
deceived by the Jewish fiction. We see that the prophet 
is definitely talking about the Easterners who are in the 
land of Canaan, where Christ's kingdom first began 
through the gospel. By the way, in Hebrew it says: 

that is, at Pharad, which we have nowhere else 
in the Bible. Therefore the Jews also invent all kinds, 
namely that it is Spain; but this does not fit at all, and | 
do not believe that any Jew knows what it is. And our 
interpreters, deceived by the consonance of the name, 
have explained xxxxx by Bosporus, which is ridiculous. 
5) Therefore, some insignificant city in the land of 
Canaan must be understood, which has become 
unknown through the course of time, so that today we 
cannot know what is in this place. For the Jnden's little 
tales are silly and like old wives' tales. 


V. 21. and saviors will come forth. 


He calls the leaders "saviors", as it is written in the 
book of Judges [Judges 3:9], because he sent many 
saviors to them, that is, leaders who were to lead them 
and preside over them, preceding them when they had 
to fight with the enemies. Thus the apostles and other 
disciples are called "saviors", namely such people who, 
by proclaiming the good news of the gospel, set them 
free from all temptations of the devil and the gates of 
hell, and judged them in faith, ruling over them in 
righteousness and judgment, thus establishing an 
eternal kingdom for the Lord. 6)

2. lectures of Luther on the pr ophet Obadiah, according to the Zwickau manuscript. *) 


Delivered in January 1525; printed in 1884. 


Translated from Latin. 


The Prophet Obadiah. 


This prophet has been torn apart by the 
interpretations in many ways. The Jews say that this 
prophet is the one who received the hundred prophets 
against Jezebel, but they have nothing but the same 
name. But in my opinion this prophet lived around the 
time of the Babylonian captivity or after it, firstly because 
he states almost the same as Jeremiah Cap. 49, who 
lived at the time of the Babylonian captivity and had 
visions, secondly, because he prophesied against 
Edom, which rejoiced greatly over the captivity of the 
Jews: "And because you, Edom, rejoice, you also shall 
be disturbed because of this wickedness. Something 
similar is in the Psalm "By the waters of Babylon" [Ps. 
137]. It agrees exactly with this [v. 7.], "Remember [the 
children of Edom] in the day of Jerusalem," that is, how 
they behaved at the time of the captivity of the 
Chaldeans. Therefore he was a contemporary of 
Jeremiah and a little after. Edom was never so powerful 
that it could have subdued Judah or Israel 2c. as is 
evident from the books of Kings. This prophet was one 
of the last; therefore the transition from the Babylonian 
captivity to the future of Christ is easy for the prophet. 
So much of the time of this prophet. But the summa is 
that he preaches the vengeance of God against Edom 
because they rejoiced [at the misery of Israel] and stood 
by the Chaldeans against the Jews 2c. Finally he says 
that it will be such a kingdom that subjugates Edom 2c. 
To the 





Time when the new kingdom will come, you will also be 
subjugated. The kingdom of Christ is described, which 
will come through the gospel 2c. 


V. i. This is the vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the 
Lord GOD of Edom, We have heard from the Lord that 
a message is sent among the heathen, saying, Come, 
and let us fight against them. 1) 


It should be "of Edom" instead of "to Edom" [in the 
Vulgate]. - Rather than auditum, it should be rumor 
(famam). We have heard that sent among the Gentiles. 
- [Instead of adVersus eum in the Vulgate it should read] 


eam, namely Idumea; he speaks of the land. He wants 
to frighten the rejoicing Edomites by these figurative 
speeches. The Lord speaks of the rumor: "A cry has 
come" that a messenger has been sent to the Gentiles. 
The image is taken from warfare, where messengers are 
sent to assemblies 2c.: "| have already sent out my 
messengers." What others do by messengers, | do by 
my spirit. GOD speaks as if he were a man. - "Among 


the Gentiles,” namely, the Chaldeans. - In proelium, 


that is, to war. These are words of the messenger who 
will procure troops of the Gentiles against the Edomites. 


1) Vulgate: Visio Abdiae. Haec dicit Dominus Deus ad 
Edom: Auditum audivimus a Domino, et legatum ad gentes 
misit: Surgite, et consurgamus adversus eum in proelium. 





*) We refer here again to the first note of the first interpretation of the prophet Joel, in which what wants to serve as introduction to 
this writing is included. The same is printed for the first time in the Erlangen edition, opp. XXV, p. 489, then in the Weimar edition, vol. XIll, p. 
207. The latter edition remarks: "Especially in this prophet, the Zwickau manuscript is very torn." Our translation is made according to the 


Weimar edition.

827 





V. 2. (Behold, | have made you lowly among the 
Gentiles 2c.) 


In gentibus, that is "among the Gentiles". It dampens 
their defiance and takes away their pride. By nature, this 
people was hostile to the Jews. Hatred among brothers 
is exceedingly terrible. The more ardent the love between 
husbands and wives, the (greater their bitterness) 2c. 
"Good wine makes good vinegar." (This hatred was with 
Edom,) not both because the blessing has been snatched 
from it, but because it is forced to be 1) under the yoke of 
the Jews. You seem great to yourself, but you are hardly 


a fly against (the other Gentiles) 2c. - Contemptibilis 
that you should be very despised. 


V. 3. The pride of your heart has deceived you. 


(Extulit te, that is) has deceived you. - (Exaltantem, that 
is) you make high. Everything is said to depress their 
confidence. You think you have a great name among the 
nations; | will make you despised. In heart thou art very 
presumptuous; this presumption shall deceive thee. - 
"The rock." You think your land is very well fortified. The 
land of the Edomites is mountainous. In the fifth book of 
Moses (Cap. 2, 3. f. 8.) Edom is called mountainous. 
(Arabia is threefold:) the stony, the desert and the happy 
Arabia. From the city of Hebrona (7?) that is, a stone, a 
rock. Idumea is the main part of stony Arabia; it has 


(Arabia petraea) its epithet from petra (stone). - 
"Because you dwell in the clefts of the rocks." 2). You rely 
on the fact that your country is mountainous and difficult 
to conquer, as the country of the Swiss is. At the same 
time he alludes to the city of Petra: Thou hast a royal and 


very strong city, a rock (petram), in the clefts of which 
thou thinkest thyself safe. - And haft your seat or your 
dwelling made high. You think you have built well and 
cannot be torn out 2c., "as if no one could come up". 


1) Instead of eoZit, eoFitur is to be read. The Weimar edition p. 
207 has indicated this as an improvement to be made, but has not 
carried it out in the text. 

2) Instead of Hui Kaditat in our original, we have assumed “nia 
daditas with the Altenburg manuscript. 


And say: Who wants to push me to the ground? 


And you say: "In spite of emperors" 2c. who "break 
in". Behold, they have trusted in the strength of the flesh, 
not in the power of GOD. Not only will you not be 
fortified, but you will be nothing. 


V. 4: If you will soar like an eagle, 


That's how | would throw you off. 

You say you have "high castles, rocks" like an eagle. 
See how the Lord hates these things in which the flesh 
trusts. Though thou dwellest in the stars, yet will | bring 
thee down to the earth through the nations. | will bring 
you down so that there will be nothing left of you. 


Vv. 5. (When thieves or transgressors shall come 
upon thee by night.) 


Investigaverunt (v. 6, "to seek"), to bring to light 


(protulerunty. - Insidias (v. 7. "will betray you"), a snare. 
3) - Thy defiance provokes me to spoil thee from the 
bottom. "Thou shalt wish" that thieves and robbers had 
entered with thee, who would have left something 
behind after all; | will leave nothing behind, even that 
which is hidden in the rocks | will bring out 2c. On rocky 
oers someone can hide; no one will be able to escape. 
Thus the prophet comforts his Jewish people against the 
vengeance of the Edomites 2c. 


(How shall you come to naught like this!) 


Conticuit is transitive (to silence). This word was 
also used in Hosea (Cap. 4, 5). Its use extends widely: 
to bring something to ruin, to make it silent, to bring it to 
naught, to make it silent. "I will make thee still, | will make 
thee small; oh how small is he that before had wished to 
devour the world. Thieves "would like to make you quiet 
and small-minded" 2c., "if they snatched away your 
arrogance" 2c. (If grape pickers came upon you,) do you 
not think that some grapes would remain? If a few 
highwaymen came "and plundered," they would dampen 
"the arrogance" to some extent, and still leave some; but 
| will not

his treasures? 


"A florin [ that you] had behind your ears would have 
to come forth" 2c. 


V. 7: All your own confederates you will push out to 
the land. 2) 


[The expression usque ad terminum is also found] 
Isa. 5, 8.:"You who bring one field to another, until there 
is no more room" 3) 2c. They will drive you out to the 
borders, so that further you will have no borders 2c., until 


you have no space in which to dwell 2c. - Prudentia 


["before you will know"] is insight. - You also trust in 
confederates, "you have good neighbors, eat" and drink 
with you, but when it "comes to the meeting", the 
opposite is there, as it happens with the pope and the 
emperor [in the war] against the French. 4) It happens 
out of God's judgment. You are not insightful, "you do 
not realize, you are a fool" 2c., "you want to be a wise 
man". This kingdom was praised for its prudence. 
Always Esau was a "fine man" 2c. The covenanters with 
whom you are at peace "will deceive you" when the 
Chaldeans come; they "will do you harm" 2c. In Ezekiel 
it says [Cap. 23, 22.]: Your couriers "will cut off your 
nose" 2c. In German: "Whoever asks the devil to be his 
godfather cannot be rid of him." The mighty whom thou 
wilt have for friends, thou shalt afterwards have for 
masters 2c. What it is to have great friends, we see 2c. 
As a wild beast is caught with a hidden snare, so shalt 
thou be caught by thy confederates. 


1) The verse number "6." is in the Weimar edition transitions, and 
"7." is set only before ?rna6ntiu. Everything that follows up to this 
point is drawn to the previous one, and this is motivated by the remark 
made about the glosses: "The Zwickau manuscript has thus drawn

V. 8: At that time | will destroy the wise men of Edom 
and the prudent men of Esau. 


Numquid non is as much as Nun. - Instead of a 


meridie it should read: "to Theman".- Timebunt, that 
is, they will be frightened, they will flee. 5) "Theman" has 
also been called this land of the Edomites. See the first 
book of Moses, Cap. 36,9 11. 15. 42. where Theman, 
the grandson of Esau, is mentioned. Princes have 
[sometimes] given their country [their own? names. - 


Prudentiam is insight. -O Theman, O Edom, now you 
have many wise men, but when that calamity comes, 
you will not Know what to do; "all their wisdom is 
devoured," says the Psalm [Ps. 107, 27. Vulg? We know 
many things and are wise in the time of prosperity, but 
in the time of adversity "we are lost" unless God gives it 
[otherwise]. In adversities "they all become fools" 2c. He 
does not speak of wisdom in teaching, but in the 
government of the kingdom, [of those who] assist the 
kings 2c. He takes away all fortifications, covenants, 
prudence, wisdom, all that dll have relied on until now. 


V. 9. 7) For your strong ones in Theman shall 
tremble (timebunt). 


Timebunt: "frighten". You will not know "where out", 
as when in war a terror comes among the army 2c. Now 
it is very well for thee 2c., but | will give thee a 
"desponding heart,” 8) by killing or by slaughtering. [I will 


set up] "such a slaughter," that the men of Edom (vir 
Edom) shall be slain, "there a man, here a man," or 


"there a heap of men," here 2c. Vir [or] Vifl is 


distributive: "here and there; there is a city" conquered, 
"there a" 2c. "With this, the ricey gezeug 9) will become

sacrilege that he has committed against his brother? 


V. 11. 1) At the time when you stood against him 2c. 


This is the sacrilege. Here he seems to be talking 
about the time of the Babylonian captivity. [Ps. 137, 7.: 
"Pure off, pure off" 2c. 


[As the strangers led away his army captive]. 


"His army", his fortune, his belongings. Both means 
the Hebrew word - "the strangers", the Chaldeans, led 
everything away captured, 2) what they could only. 
Jerusalem was not taken other than by the Chaldeans. 
The Edomites "had good courage" and made common 
cause with the Chaldeans. 


V. 12. You shall no longer see your lust in your 
brother. 


[The Hebrew says:] Thou shalt not see in the day of

The first prophecy is about the physical kingdom of

salvation in Zion after this captivity and the disturbance 
of the Edomites, this cannot be assumed.

833 





The kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel can be 
understood differently than the salvation through Christ. 
These two kingdoms of Judah and Israel are different. 
Israel has been so disturbed that nothing remains that 
could be restored; Judah, however, has been so 
changed into the kingdom of Christ. Understand the one 
from the spiritual kingdom, the other from the physical 
kingdom. 


They shall be sanctuary; and the house of Jacob 
shall possess its owners. 


The word "shall possess" is actually "to take in". This 
glorious word cannot fit the kingdom of Judah or the 
fleshly Israel. He understands it of the spiritual kingdom, 
in which the house of Israel are the apostles and others. 
What will they possess? 1) The Medes [, the Assyrians, 
the Edomites] 2) and the whole world 2c. The salvation 
from the kingdom of conquered death and devil, "that will 
start in Zion", as it is said in Isaiah Cap. 2, 3. through the 
word of the gospel and the preaching 2c. - "Sanctuary," 
which can no longer be defiled, as has hitherto been 
done after the manner of the Gentiles 2c. - "Its 


possessors" ([quI] possederant) is said of the Gentiles 
who were scattered over the whole world. Afterward, 
when the gospel came, they were gathered into the 
obedience of faith 2c.

Possession. "The house of Jacob" [that is, the rest who 
are saved through Christ]. "The house of Joseph" [that 
is] the kingdom of Israel. This never happened fleshly, 
so it must be understood spiritually. The house of 
Joseph did not return after the Assyrian 4) captivity. This 
will happen after Edom is consumed. [By the Holy Spirit] 
it has been made nothing. He therefore shows a new 
disturbance and fire au: the gospel will eiuverleiben with 
the rest of the Gentiles, even the Edomites. "That shall 
consume them," that is, they shall so_ spiritually 
incorporate them that they cannot be plucked out of their 
hands. In John [Cap. 10, 28.] it is said, "No man shall 
pluck them out of my hand." Once the gospel is truly 
accepted, it cannot easily be taken away. This kingdom 
of Christ will so subjugate the kingdom of Esau as the 
rest of the Gentiles, in such a way that nothing will 
remain to rule or reign over the kingdom of Christ 2c. It 
is a prophecy of the spreading of the gospel and the 
word among all the Gentiles. 


V. 19. And they that are toward the south shall 
possess the mountain of Esau 2c. 

"There is misery, distress" in the text. We are urged 
to go to the spiritual kingdom of Christ. He wants to say 
this with whimsical and veiled words, but with glorious 


words. You know that in the law the tribes are separated, 
and warned that no mixing should be done. Against this 


law cannot be prophesied. The Israelites at noon I: hi, 
qui ad] austrum [sunt], that is, the Christians who will 


be on Mount Zion, which is the noon, at the time of 
Christ. But those will possess Esau. Those at Zion

"the grounds" “should be called; the Latin interpreter 


translates: campestria, "the meadows". He calls the 
Christians by this name, "the

the Philistines. This never happened in the flesh, [but] in 
the spiritual kingdom of Christ. "The reasons," namely, 
toward noon, that is, the Christians in Zion, which is at 


noon. These very ones in the grounds (vallenses) will 
possess the field [Ephraim] 2c. This is against Moses, 
therefore it must be understood spiritually by the 
Christians, by Peter, John and Philip, who came to 
Samaria.

Gilead. 


This tribe is on this side of the Jordan. "Gilead" in the 
tribe of Gad is beyond the Jordan. - This is contrary to 
Moses, therefore it must be understood of the spiritual 
kingdom of Christ. The children of Benjamin are also at 


noon (australes), that is, Christians, a tribe of Judah. 


V. 20. And the exiles of this army of the children of 
Israel 2c. 


"This is still much" more inconsistent [than the 
preceding]. This captivity, these Israelites, who are 
captives in the Assyrian captivity, and are never to 
return, and yet are to possess all the Oerter, all the 
Cananaean land “unto Sidon  nan,"-this is an 
inconsistency, that the captives should rule, "therefore it 
must" be understood spiritually. Now [he says] of Judah

apparent inconsistency of the text one sees that it 
cannot be understood otherwise than spiritually. - About 
"Zarpath" see in the books of Kings [1 Kings 17:9]. What 
Lyra says is forcible. The prophet looks to the kingdom 
of Christ, which has its beginning and increases in this 
land 2c. He speaks of the kingdom in its beginning, 


"does not come out of the land." - [In] Bosphoro, 2)

the Turk is. Jerome s, who translated thus,] has been 
deceived by his Jew. He [the prophet] speaks of 
Jerusalem taken away by the Chaldeans. These taken 
away ones "shall now execute it". - "Sepharad," in my 
opinion, must be a proper name of his city] in that land, 
as "Zarpath" 2c. above. The opinion will therefore be: the 
captive Jews who are now in Sepharad "shall" take noon 
by preaching the Gospel 2c. Only no one believes that it

time. It seems that Jerome was deceived by the Jew by 
the consonance.

That means leader, as in the book of Judges [Cap. 3, 
9]. But he understands the apostles, who are leaders in 
word. They are concerned about Esau, even though 
their apostles ruled over all the nations in faith. Edom will 
be a kingdom of the Lord. This was not done fleshly, but 
spiritually.

*) After Luther had given lectures on the prophet Jonah (very probably in February 1525; for on February 1 he had finished the Obadiah), 
he himself published the present Scripture in German in 1526. The first edition appeared under the title: "Der Prophet Jona, ausgelegt durch 
Mart. Luth." At the end: "Printed at Wittemberg. Michel Lotterus. In M.D.XXVI iar." In the same year, two other editions were published in 
Wittenberg, and one in Erfurt in 1531. By three different people this writing was translated into Latin, namely in 1526 by Johann Lonicer and 
published under the title: lona Propheta, cum annotationibus M. Lutheri, Anno M.D.XXVI At the end: *.rMntorati apua lodannsm

(2) Not only for the sake of the spirits and the mobs 
do | do this, so that the devil may attack us on the right 
side; but also for the sake of the tyrants 1) so that he may 
attack us on the left. For the mad princes and bishops, 
by their God's provocation, rage and rage with all 
seriousness, and have evil in mind to drive out God and 
His anointed and to destroy His word, and have already 
shed much innocent blood, and are hastening to shed it 
with all their might, so that we may well boast that 
Christianity is now standing and walking in the right 
pregnancy, because it is so severely attacked on both 
sides, and in addition is so shamefully cursed, 
blasphemed, defiled and mocked by both parts, as 
perhaps it has never been blasphemed and defiled 
before, that it seems to me that the devil is trying his 
utmost, and because he foresees the last day, he wants 
to prove all his ability in Christ and his word. 

Against all this, we again need to be comforted, not 
to be frightened by it, but to laugh undauntedly at their 
dread, defiance and raving, as we know that they will 
thereby promote us to heaven in the highest way, and 
that they themselves will run off their necks as quickly as 
possible, so that they will soon be reduced to ashes by 
God's judgment. Let us look at each other in a different 
way, and let the devil with his larvae, that is, with his 
princes and bishops, find out who they are, who they are 
blaspheming, who they are chasing away and who they 
are strangling. 

(4) Therefore | have taken this holy prophet Jonah 
before me to interpret, as he almost rhymes well with 
these things, and presents an excellent, special, 
comforting example of faith, and a mighty miraculous 
sign of divine goodness to all the world. For who should 
not trust God with all his heart, and proudly defy all 
devils, the world and all furious tyrants, and be proud of 
God's goodness, when he considers this example, that 
God's power and grace are so powerful that they can 
save Jonah in the middle of the deep sea, and also in the 
middle of the whale, that is, not in a-

2) Wittenberger: allerelendest. 


lei, but many deaths, forsaken and unknown by all men, 
by all creatures, as easily as if it were no trouble to him, 
and he only says this with one word? As if he should say 
to us, "Behold, | do this with a word; what do you think | 
could do with my mind and strength? For it is 
incomprehensible to the human heart that a greater work 
should be done than this. That is why Christ himself 
thinks much of this story, and before all the prophets he 
points to this Jonah as an example of his death and 
resurrection, as he says Matth. 12, 39: "No sign will 
happen to this kind without the sign of Jonah the 
prophet" 2c. 

(5) He is also a comfort to all who are to guide the 
word, that they may not despair of the fruit of the gospel, 
though it is almost evil, and does not seem to bear much 
fruit or profit. For here a single man, Jonah, is sent to the 
most powerful king and the greatest empire on earth at 
that time, so that, if we compare what Jonah is with the 
king, it is a mockery and an impossibility that such a 
powerful king and such a great empire should move, by 
the word of a few, little, strange men, and by a sermon 
that the king himself did not hear, but only heard the 
rumor of, so that | may say that no apostle, nor prophet, 
nor Christ himself did and accomplished such a great 
thing with a sermon as Jonah. And so great a miracle is 
it, or rather greater, that Jonah converted the city of 
Nineveh with one sermon than that he was delivered 
from the belly of the whale. For just as the whale had to 
spit out Jonah by the word of God, so also Jonah by the 
word of God snatched the city of Nineveh out of the belly 
and mouth of the devil, that is, out of sins and death. 
Should not such a king rely on his great power and 
consider the one man a liar, whom his Hebrews 
themselves did not obey? And the apostles, like Christ 
himself, were so shamefully despised by the kings and 
princes of the earth, Ps. 2:2, and even now are princes, 
bishops and lords who are beggars compared to the king 
of Nineveh, 


840 Erl. 41, 328 ¢. 332 f. Interpretation of Jonah (1.), Cap. 1, 1. W. V1, 2893-2897. 


841 





yet rely so heavily on their beggar's sack that they not 
only despise the word of God but also persecute it. 

For this reason Christ leads the Ninevites against all 
unbelievers and despisers of His word and says: "The 
people of Nineveh will appear at the last judgment and 
condemn this generation. For they repented after the 
preaching of Jonah. 1) And behold, here is more than 
Jonah." And this is 


1) In the original and in the Wittenberg: "because they atoned through 
the preaching of Jonah". 





nor unreasonable. For it is a great wonder that the 
Ninevites were converted so soon because of a foreign 
preacher, by a bad word, without any miraculous signs; 
and these are not converted by their own Savior, who 
preaches so much and showers them with miraculous 
signs. O, what a shame it is to hear this now! But what 
a shame it will be when they see it too? But it does not 
help, they are and remain obdurate; therefore we let 
them go, and take our comfort and benefit from this 
prophet, as much as God grants us. Amen. 


The prophet Jonah. 


The first chapter. *) 


V. 1. [The word of the LORD came to Jonah the son 
of Amithail. 


1) Some want to hold this prophet Jonah, as Jerome 
shows that he was the son of the widow at Zarpath near 
Zidon, who nursed the prophet Elijah in his time, in the 
first book of Kings Cap. 17, 10. and Luc. 4, 26. Take the 
reason that he calls himself a son of Amithai, that is, a 
son of the truthful one, because his mother said to Elijah 
when he had raised him from death: "Now | know that the 
words of your mouth are true" [1 Kings 17:24]. | do not 
believe that, but his father was called Amithai, in Latin 


Verax, in German Wahrlich, and was from 
GathHepher, which city is in the tribe of Zebulun, Joshua 
19, 13. For so it is written 2 Kings. 14:25: "King Jeroboam 
brought again the border of Israel from Hemath to the sea 
in the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of 
Israel, which he spake by his servant Jonah the son of 
Amithai, the prophet of 





GathHepher." Also the widow of Zarpath was a Gentile, 
as Christ also reports Luc. 4, 26, but Jonah confesses 
here Cap. 1, 9 that he was a Hebrew. 


(2) | say this because, where it can be had, it is 
almost good to know what time and in what country a 
prophet lived and was. For it helps to understand his 
book if one knows the time, place, person and history 
that took place at that time. So we have that this Jonah 
was in the time of king Jeroboam, whose grandfather 
was king Jehu, at which time king Uzziah reigned in 
Judah; at which time also in the same kingdom of Israel 
were the prophets Hosea, Amos, Joel in other places 
and cities. 


(3) From this it may be seen that this Jonah was an 
excellent and precious man in the kingdom of Israel, and 
that God did great things through him, namely, that 
through his preaching the king Jeroboam was so 
blessed, and recovered all that Hazael king of Syria had 
taken from the kingdom of Israel. 


*) Here follows in the original edition the text of the whole prophet. We have omitted the same, as Walch did. 


842 Eri. 41, 333-33K. Interpretations on the Prophets. W. VI, 2597-2600. 


843 





1) and did such great harm that even the prophet Elisha 
wept over it before it happened, 2 Kings 8:ll. And yet God 
showed such kindness, regardless of the fact that the 
kingdom of Israel was_ still idolatrous, and_ still 
worshipped the golden calves in Samaria. It is such a 
great grace when God gives a man to a country with his 
word that he not only bears the iniquity and disobedience 
of a whole country for its sake, but also helps it and 
shows it abundantly. What should he not do and leave 
where there is more than a godly man? 

4 Whether this story of Jonah in Nineveh and in the 
whale happened before he was so helpful and helpful to 
King Jeroboam, or after he returned from Nineveh, is not 
clear from the Scriptures. However, it is plausible that he 
served and helped King Jeroboam in his own country 
until he restored and established the kingdom of Israel. 
After that he was sent to Nineveh, outside his own 
country, by God. For in his own country he learned by 
experience how God was so kind and gracious over the 
idolatrous kingdom of Israel, so that he was well aware 
that he would also be so kind and gracious over Nineveh 
that his preaching would be in vain and futile, as he 
himself confesses and is angry about, Cap. 4, |. 2. 

(5) Thus it was in the world in the days of Jonah, that the 
chief kingdom or empire of the world was in Assyria, in 
Nineveh, as it was afterward in Babylon, and afterward 
in Rome. Next to it were the other kingdoms, Syria, 
Israel, Judah, Edom, Moab, each of them separately. 
And the kingdom of Israel was well established under 
Jeroboam the king, because of Jonah; and the kingdom 
of Judah also was well established under Uzziah the 
king. 

6 But this was the last, and the blessing of John, which 
God gave to the kingdom of Israel. For after the death of 
Jeroboam, since the people did not improve at all, nor 
did they turn away from idolatry, the blessing of John 
was given. 


1) The preceding, with the exception of the first two sentences in z 2, 
is used by Luther for the preface to the prophet Jonah. See Walch, 
vol. XIV, 70 and Erlanger Ausg., vol. 63, 80 f. 





neither by punishment nor by benevolence, the kingdom 
fell apart; one king murdered another, until the emperor 
of Assyria came and destroyed both Syria and Israel, 
and led them away, so that they have not returned to this 
day, as the last chapter in the other Book of Kings 
testifies. Because there was such a great calamity and 
destruction of the whole kingdom because of the sin of 
the people, God sent his word beforehand through his 
prophets, warning them that they might be converted, or 
even that some might be saved and kept. 

(7) For this is what God always does when his great 
wrath is present, that he sends his word first and saves 
some. Thus he sends Noah before the flood of sin [Gen. 
6], Lot before he sank Sodom [Gen. 19], Abraham, 
Isaac, Jacob before he destroyed the land of Canaan, 
Joseph and Moses before he struck Egypt: so also here 
Jonah, and Hosea before he destroyed Israel, and 
Jonah before he turned back Nineveh. In the same way 
he sent Christ, his Son, into the world before the last 
wrath of the last judgment. But after Christ's death, not 
only Jerusalem, but also Rome and the whole Roman 
district and empire were destroyed. 

(8) We also now have the same grace and great light 
of the divine word, therefore there is certainly great 
destruction; God will take some before it comes, and 
even kill us if we do not mend our ways. As we, 
unfortunately, do badly enough, we have already 
incurred great punishments. 


V. 2. And said, Arise, and go into the great city of 
Nineveh, and preach therein 2c. 


9 Here we see that God does not only take care of 
the Jews, but also of the Gentiles, and as St. Paul says 
Rom. 3, 29: "God is not only the God of the Jews, but 
also the God of the Gentiles. And yet it is not stated here 
that the Ninevites circumcised themselves, or kept or 
accepted the law of the Jews, but are commended only 
because they believed the word of God, and became 
better and more devout. 

(10) This is a mighty blow against the Jews, and the 
strength of our Christian faith, and it is well for us to 
remember. For from this 


844 Erl. 41, 338-338. 


Interpretation of Jonah (1.), cap. 1, 2. W. VI, 2600-2602. 


845 





We may conclude that circumcision and Mosiah's law 
are not necessary for being pious and pleasing to God, 
and that it is not true that the Jews think that all the world 
must become Jews and accept and keep Mosiah's laws, 
as if the Jews alone should be God's people. For here 
Jonah stands with his book, showing that the Ninivites, 
without all the law and ways of the Jews, by faith and 
good works alone, please and satisfy God, and God 
demands no more of them. For if Mosiah's law were 
necessary for them to become pious, they would also 
have to have accepted it; but that does not happen here. 
Again, we find that the Jews are required to have faith 
and good works, and that they are not helped by their 
circumcision and all kinds of worship, as Isaiah 1:11 
rejects them with their sacrifices and deeds. And here 
we find the saying of St. Paul, Rom. 2, 14, that the 
Gentiles keep the law without the law, and the Jews 
transgress the law through the law, so that it is 
necessary to take hold of how Moses' law alone is 
imposed on the Jewish people for a time, to force and 
humiliate them with it, as with a dungeon and cane 
master, as St. Paul says Gal. 3, 24, and not at all that 
they should or would become devout through it, but 
greedy for Christ and God's grace. 

(12) So Jonah's prophecy confirms the saying of St. 
Paul, Rom. 3:28, that by the works of the law no one can 
become righteous before God, but man must become 
righteous without all the works of the law, through faith, 
which then does good works; as we see here with these 
Ninevites. Now if the Ninivites were not obliged to keep 
the Law of Moses or to become Jews at that time, when 
Christ had not yet come, and the Law still stood and 
applied among the Jews: how much less are we now 
obliged to do so, since Christ has come, and has 
abolished the Law also among the Jews? Therefore, like 
the Ninevites, we need nothing more than a true faith 
that does good works and makes people righteous 2c. 
(13) | say this not only for the sake of the Jews, to 
dispute with them, but also for our sake, who are not 
against the same devil. 





have this divine teaching. First of all, the pope and his 
followers, who call it a new doctrine, and impose on us 
much greater and more laws than the law of Moses was, 
and want to make us devout before God with it. But | 
think it is old enough, because it was so long at the time 
of Jonah, before the birth of Christ, and also enough, 
because it made the Ninevites devout without the Law 
of Moses, even before anyone could have dreamed of 
the papacy. 

14. On the other hand, we have the mobs and 
swarming spirits who want to burden and master us with 
Moses' law, knowing nothing, neither what Moses or 
Christ is, or how far Moses applies, or what he serves 
for, as the iconoclasts have been until now, and who 
wanted to put the worldly sword into Moses' laws, and 
cried out confidently: Here is God's word, God's word, 
God's word, just as if it were enough that God's word is 
there, and not also to be seen with distinction which are 
those to whom it is commanded. 

15 For it was also the word of God that Noah should 
build the ark, and Abraham should sacrifice his son, and 
Solomon should build the temple, but it is not for me to 
do likewise. For such a word of God is not spoken to me; 
but this common word is spoken to me and to all: Amend 
yourselves, and believe, as is said here to the Ninivites. 
Therefore, we must not ask whether it is God's word, but 
whether it is said to us or not, and then accept it or not 
2c. 

16 But behold, what a great ministry God has laid 
upon Jonah, that he should command the one man to 
preach against the mighty empire of Assyria, against the 
king and his princes. The great lords dislike it so much 
when they are scolded and punished, and want to be 
unpunished. Now God commands Jonah to tell them 
their wickedness; it truly requires courage, it requires an 
open mouth. He has ever had to say to them: You are 
evil and damned, your good nature is a mere pretense 
and deceives you. For it is not possible that in such a 
mighty kingdom there should not have been fine people 
who lived an honorable, blameless life before the world.

have led. To punish them all at once, and to scourge 
them with God's wrath, is a great thing, and is evil to 
suffer, especially among the great merchants. 

(17) In sum, | see little of history, because we look at it 
from the outside, and it does not concern us; but if such 
a thing should happen to us, or if we had been there at 
that time, it would seem to us that we had never seen or 
heard of anything more foolish and impossible than that 
a single man should attack such an empire. How would 
it look if you or | were sent to the Turkish emperor to 
punish him with his princes and empire? How often has 
it been so ridiculous that someone has spoken against 
the pope! 

18 Now, God's works tend to appear so foolish and 
impossible at first that reason must despair and scoff at 
them; but it serves us well that we believe. For God 
carries out what He speaks and begins, no matter how 
foolish and impossible it may seem. "God's foolishness 
is wiser than men," 1 Cor. 1:25, which Jonah proves 
here. 


V. 3 Jonah set out to flee from the Lord to the sea 
and went down to Japho. 


19 The Latin text holds here together with the Greek: gen 
Tharsis, since | have translated: "on the sea". So that the 
smart people do not condemn me too much about this, | 
must indicate the reasons. They say that Jonah went to 
Tarsus to the city of Cilicia, where St. Paul was from, 
Acts 9, 11. 9, 11. But this has no basis in Scripture. For 
the text does not say: to Tarsus, but: to Tharsis, or to 
Tharsis. The Hebrew tongue has two words that mean 
the sea, Jam and Tharsis. Jam means not only the great 
sea, but also the great lakes, as Lucas calls the sea a 
lake, where Christ sailed with his disciples to Tiberius 
and Capernaum and Bethsaida, which Joh. 6, 17. and 
the other evangelists call the Galilean sea. Also Moses 
Cap. 1, 10. says: "God called the gathered waters Jam", 
that is, lakes or sea. But Tharsis actually means the 


great sea, which is not a lake, but the one where Rhodes, 
Cyprus and many other islands lie, where St. Paul sailed 
from, Apost. 28, 10. ff., which is now held by the Turk, 
Venice, France and Hispania. For it reaches from Cilicia 
to the end in Hispania. The Red Sea and the other large, 
high seas are also called Tharsis. 

20 Thus saith the 72nd Psalm, v. 10: "The kings of 
Tharsis and the isles shall bring gifts," that is, the kings 
of the great sea, and the isles within. For the city of 
Tarsus is not a kingdom, nor has it ever had a king, let 
alone many kings. So Solomon sent his ships to Tharsis, 
that is, to the sea, to the east through the Red Sea, to 
fetch gold in the land of India [1 Kings 9:26-28]. The ships 
could not sail to Tarsus to the city, because they would 
have wanted to sail on land. For between Tarsus and the 
Red Sea there is vain land, as the land sailors know. 
Psalm 48:8 says, "You break the ships of Tarsus with a 
strong wind," that is, the ships in the sea. And Isaiah, 
Cap. 23, 1: "Hail, ye ships of Tharsis," that is, ye ships of 
the sea. And of the sayings much more, that also St. 
Jerome himself confesses here, it may better be called 
sea than Tarsus, the city. For Jonah was not concerned 
about a certain city where he fled, for he had nothing to 
do anywhere, but he only intended to flee to the sea, 
wherever he wanted to go. He sought escape and did not 
ask where he was going. As the text also says here, he 
set out to flee from the Lord, and since he had nowhere 
to go, he thought to go to the sea, he would come 
wherever the wind blew him. 

21 Japho is the city of Joppa, which is now called 
when one goes to Jerusalem, and is called in German 
the schéne, or beautiful. For there is the ford to the 
Jewish land. So Jonah went from Jerusalem and from the 
land of Judah to the sea toward the west. This is also 
indicated by the word, where he says: "he fled from the 
Lord". Who can flee from the Lord? Is he not at all ends? 
as the 139th Psalm, v. 7, says: "Where will | go before 
your spirit? And where shall | flee from thy presence?" 
For Jonah was 


848 ex. 41, 340-343. interpretation of Jonah (1.), Cap. 1, 3. w. VI, 2605-2608. 


849 





not so great that he should not know how God is at all 
ends, since he himself afterwards confessed that "he 
serves the God who made heaven and earth, the sea 
and the dry land. Thus he had also heard that God was 
at Nineveh, because he intended to punish their 
wickedness, and to send Jonah there. 

But this is how it is to be understood: God has two kinds 
of being or presence: one is natural, the other spiritual. 
Naturally he is at all ends, as Isaiah says, Cap. 66, 1.: 
"Heaven is my chair, and the ground my footstool." So 
he is also in the midst of hell, death and sins, as the 
above-mentioned 139th Psalm, v. 8. says: "If | go to hell, 
you are also there" 2c. So no one can escape from it. But 
spiritually he is alone, since he is thus known; that is, 
where his word, faith, spirit and worship are, there are 
those who are his, who alone feel how God is such a 
Lord, who is almighty and all-sufficient. The wicked, 
however, do not feel this, do not believe it, and do not 
know it either, that God is at all ends, even though they 
can hear it and say it. So one can flee from God if one 
flees to a place where there is no word, faith, spirit or 
knowledge of God. So Jonah fled from the Lord, that is, 
from the Jewish people and land, where God's word, 
spirit, faith and knowledge were, to the sea among the 
Gentiles, where there was no faith, word or spirit of God. 
(23) Now here arises the question, whether Jonah also 
sinned in fleeing from the Lord? The old holy fathers 
were inclined to excuse the prophets, apostles and great 
saints; with what foolish humility they came so far away 
that they did violence to the holy scriptures and God's 
word before, forced and pushed them, before they let the 
saints be sinners. Although their humility, which comes 
from hatred of sins and honor of righteousness, is to be 
tolerated, it is still dangerous to guide the Scriptures in 
this way and to follow their interpretation. Christ speaks 
much differently Matth. 5, 18: "that heaven and earth 
must pass away, before the least letter or tittle of the 
Scriptures should pass away. It is better to give too little 
to the saints than too much, and better to break 


from them, because God Himself in His word. For without 
the saints we can be blessed; without God's word we 
may not be blessed. 

(24) So we stand firm and firm on the words of God, and 
let Jonah have committed a great and grievous sin here, 
by which he would have been eternally damned, if he had 
not been written in the Book of Life in the number of the 
elect. For no one can deny that God gave Jonah a 
command and told him to go and preach to Nineveh. So 
itis also certain that God is not joking, but is very serious, 
as serious as He was when He commanded Adam in 
Paradise. For he says: "the wickedness of the city of 
Nineveh has come before him", that is, he wanted to 
punish the whole kingdom. In short, great wrath is there. 
So it is also obvious that Jonah disobeys such a serious 
commandment of God, because he is afraid and does 
not want to do it, and sins as hardly as Adam sinned in 
paradise. For he should not only have accepted such 
divine will, but also have done it with all joy, and suffer a 
hundred deaths before he would disobey God's word. 
For what can be greater, more horrible thing than to 
disobey God's will? See how it happened to Adam, Saul 
and the people of Israel. Yes, see, how it goes over here 
Jonah himself. | think his disobedience will be punished 
horribly and terribly enough that the punishment will 
show how it was not a small sin. How finely he escapes 
God's obedience on the sea, that he might have wished 
to die three times for it in the land. He does not want to 
go to Nineveh, so he has to go into the middle of the sea, 
into the mouth of the whale. 

(25) All this is written for our warning. In the first place, 
that we learn the piece: Whoever does not want to be 
obedient to God with kindness, must at last be obedient 
to Him with unkindness, and His will goes away; and see 
here, whoever refuses to be obedient to a little one for 
the sake of God, must suffer so much the greater for it: 
that nothing is better for us, than only to be obedient soon 
and say: "Your will be done in heaven and on earth" 
[Matth.

VI, 2608-2610. 851 





6, 10.] But this is a great sign of grace, that God seeks 
and punishes Jonah so soon for his sin, and does not let 
it benefit him, nor does he remain in it for a long time, so 
that he may well sing with David [Ps. 118, 18.]: "The Lord 
has beaten me, but has not delivered me to death." 

26. on the other hand, that we may know God's grace 
rightly, and not be attached to our merits, either good or 
bad, but know that neither sin condemns us nor good 
works make us blessed, but that God's grace alone 
sustains us, and condemns us both, sin and good works, 
if we doubt in sins and rely on good works. For here you 
see that Jonah does not deserve by some good work to 
be preserved in the fish belly and brought out to land 
again, but by the grace of God alone, as he reports very 
well in his hymn of praise, as we shall hear. Again, you 
see that there is great sin enough, and yet he is not 
condemned nor forsaken. That is why he does not despair 
and despair in sin, remains firmly attached to God's grace, 
and willingly surrenders to punishment. For where he 
would have despaired, he would never have come out 
again. His great faith in the midst of sin makes it so that 
God cannot forget him, but must pull him out of it again, 
which will be said later. 

(27) Now this is also a great comfort to us, that we 

see how even the greatest, most excellent saints sin so 
grievously against God, and that not only we are poor, 
miserable sinners, but that they also were men, having 
flesh and blood like us, so that we also may not despair 
whether we sin and fall, so far as not to fall from the 
kingdom of grace through false teaching and superstition. 
For as in the kingdom of grace there is no sin so great that 
it cannot be forgiven, so apart from grace there is no work 
so good, no life so holy, that is not condemned. 
28 But this is what | mean by remaining in the kingdom of 
grace, so that one does not also sin against grace. To sin 
against grace happens in two ways. The first, when | have 
sinned against God's commandment, and | have sinned 
against it. 





| believe and make a conscience for myself, as if God did 
not want to forgive me the sin and there is no more grace. 
For there is no more grace, but God with all grace has 
been denied and destroyed. This is no longer a human 
sin, but a devilish sin, and a sin against the Holy Spirit, 
which cannot be forgiven as long as it remains so, 
because it is completely against grace, by which sin 
should be forgiven. 

29) But this means to remain in the kingdom of grace, 
if | do not despair of God's grace and the forgiveness of 
sins, no matter how great the sin, but remain firm in my 
mind and conscience that grace and forgiveness are still 
there, even if God's wrath and the wrath of all creatures 
wanted to devour me, and my own conscience itself said 
that grace was over and God did not want to forgive. That 
is 1) to exalt, praise and honor God's mercy above all 
things, and to defy all wrath and judgment above it, as 
Jacobus says in his epistle [Cap. 2, 13]: "Mercy defies 
judgment," that is, mercy is more valid and more worthy 
than all wrath, all judgment, all judgment of God. And 
whoever believes this can also with it defy all the wrath 
and judgment of God. Whoever cannot do this, then 
judgment defies grace, and grace alone must come to 
nothing, and judgment alone must reign to death and 
damnation, just as again, where grace defies, then 
judgment must come to nothing, and grace alone must 
reign to life and blessedness forever, as happens here to 
Jonah. This is no longer a human righteousness based 
on our works and powers, but an angelic, even divine 
righteousness based on faith and the Spirit, without any 
works. For it depends only on grace, which is not able to 
do any work. For everything happens in the heart and in 
pleasures, since there is no work in it, nor does any come 
to it. 

30. the other way, when | do good works 


1) Wittenberger: It says. But our reading is confirmed by the other 
editions and by the Latin. 


852 Erl. 41, 345-347. interpretation of Jonah (1.), Cap. 1, 3. 


W. VI, 2610-2813. 853 





and | add this devilish addition to it, and rely on it or take 
comfort in it, and make a conscience of it, so that | can 
stand before God by it, as if there were no sin. For in this 
way | nullify grace for myself, as if it were neither 
necessary nor useful, because works may accomplish 
this. Then God with all His grace is denied, and there is 
no longer divine but devilish righteousness, which 
cannot be forgiven as long as it remains so and is not 
recognized. This means, then, to remain outside the 
kingdom of grace, and to sin against grace, if one 
becomes so pious in some work or being that he does 
not need forgiveness nor grace for it, but without grace 
and forgiveness considers the work itself good enough 
and pure enough. 

(31) Then the saying of Jacob is reversed, and is no 
longer called, "Mercy defies judgment," but thus, "Work 
defies judgment, yea, work defies mercy. This is sin in 
the Holy Spirit that cannot be forgiven, that is, it does not 
have mercy by which it would be forgiven, as all other 
sins have without such addition. For all other sins retain 
the piece, and leave the defiance that grace and 
forgiveness are still there, more and greater than sin. But 
this sin and good works put grace out of sight, and do 
not leave the defiance, but sin says, Grace is not there, 
and will not forgive. Good works say, Grace is nothing, 
1) and | may not have it. So they are both fallen from the 
kingdom of grace, and sin against grace. 

From this it can be understood what Christ means that 
sin is not forgiven in the Holy Spirit, neither here nor 
there, Matth. 12, 13. and Marc. 3, 28. and John, when he 
says [1. Epist. 5, 16.]: "one should not ask for mortal sin". 
For mortal sin he calls sin in the Holy Spirit. And all this 
is said: He who despairs in sins, or defies good works, 
sins against the Holy Spirit and against grace. Now here 
| should pray for 





1) Wittenberger: is not. 





that they might be freed from such sin and converted; but 
that God should be gracious to them in such sins, and 
allow his grace to be more valid in their hearts than such 
sin, as it is in the other sins, that is an impossible thing. 
For then | prayed at the same time that God's mercy 
should be less and yet more than such sin; nothing 
comes of it; but | should pray against such sin, as Moses 
does, Numbers 16:15, when he prays against Korah, 
saying, "Thou wouldest not look upon their sacrifice." For 
Korah also wanted to count something before God 
through his work, and thus sinned against grace. This 
was not to be suffered. Otherwise all sins are to be 
suffered, where they let grace defy and be master. That 
is enough of it now. 

But what moved Jonah to such disobedience that he 
would not gladly go to Nineveh? First, that he refused 
such a great, new, unheard-of ministry, because he 
alone was sent before all other prophets to such a great 
king in a foreign land; for it is not read that God ever sent 
a prophet from the land of Israel so far away and to such 
a great kingdom. Because this is such a new and strange 
command, which has no example of such a thing ever 
having been done before, it is also wild and strange to 
the prophet Jonah that God should command him to do 
such a thing before anyone else. As flesh and blood is 
naturally minded, we hardly want to go where God does 
something special to us before others. Just as Peter, 
John 21:19 ff, looked around for John, when Christ said 
to him, "Follow me," and asked, "What should John do? 
and do not see that we have to go up alone in the end, 
just as Jonah happens here, who does not want to leave 
the land of his own, so he has to go alone into the middle 
of the sea and into the mouth of the whale, since he 
could not think otherwise, because he would be alone 
with God in heaven and earth. O, this is a hard thing! 

(34) One might also say that he was afraid of the 
great king. Some think that he did it because he was 
afraid that his prophecy would be reversed, and that he 
would not be able to

Interpretations on the Prophets. W. VI, 2613-2616. 


855 





He was worried that he would be taken for a liar and a 
false prophet whose word was not true or from God. But 
this cause is nothing. For Jonah did not know what would 
happen, because the 4th chapter, v. 5, says that he sat 
outside the city, waiting to see what would happen to it. 
From this it can be seen that he waited until it perished, 
like Sodom and Gomorrah, and was angry that it did not 
happen as he hoped. Therefore, one can assume that 
the cause of his disobedience was that he was hostile to 
the city of Nineveh and still had a Jewish, carnal opinion 
of God, as if God were the God of the Jews alone and 
not of the Gentiles. 

35 Therefore his heart was set on thinking that the 
Ninevites were not worthy of God's word and grace, 
because they were not God's people, that is, Jews, or 
among the Israelite people, just as the apostles at first 
fleshly thought that Christ's kingdom should be in the 
flesh, and then, when they recognized it spiritually, still 
thought that it should be of the Jews alone, and preached 
the gospel to the Jews alone, Acts 8. 8, until they saw 
GOD by a vision to Petro from heaven, Apost. 10, 10. ff., 
and by a public calling of Paul and Barnabae, Cap. 13, 
2. 3., and by miracles and signs, finally by a common 
concilium, Cap. 15, 1. ff., that God would also give grace 
to the Gentiles, and would also be God to the Gentiles. 
For it was difficult for the Jews to believe that other 
people besides Israel were God's people, because the 
sayings of Scripture speak of Israel and Abraham's seed, 
and only with them were God's word, worship, laws and 
holy prophets. Paul also wrote the epistle to the Romans 
for the sake of this matter, in which he deals with this 
very article in the strongest and most powerful way, with 
mighty writings, that God is God not only of the Jews, but 
also of the Gentiles [Rom. 3:29]. For this still hinders the 
Jews today, because they do not want to believe that the 
Gentiles are God's people as well as the Jews. 
36Therefore Jonah also is in such a mind, and comes 
into such a fight about it, that he 








It must learn with such a great puff, with a likeness of the 
wild turnip, and with a strong testimony of God from 
heaven, that God also considers Nineveh to be His city, 
and the Ninevites to be His people. Just as Christ 
admitted his disciples to their carnal thoughts of the 
kingdom of God, so he also admits Jonah to his carnal 
thoughts. For behold, how hard it has been to believe 
that there are any Christians who are not under the pope, 
since there are all false appearances and wrong 
interpretations of the Scriptures: what should happen 
where dry, bright sayings established the pope's office, 
as Judaism was established? How should we shy away 
from Turks, Jews and Gentiles, and hold to the Pabstacy 
alone! So Jonah also happened in the Judaism and 
Israelite kingdom. 

37 This is what he says in Cap. 4, 2. says: he fled 
because he wanted to know how God was so kind 2c., to 
show that he was equally sorry that God was so kind and 
showed mercy to the Ninevites, and for this reason he 
would rather not preach, and would much rather be dead, 
than that the grace of God, which should belong to the 
people of Israel, should also be given to the Gentiles, 
who have neither God's word, nor the Law of Moses, nor 
God's service, nor prophets, nor anything, but strive 
against God and His word and His people. But that this 
was Jonah's opinion, clearly shows that God punishes 
his displeasure and anger with these words [Cap. 4, 11.]: 
"Should | not spare Nineveh?" 2c. There he gives to 
understand that Jonah did not like to see that God spared 
the city, and was angry that he did not turn it around, as 
he had preached and would have liked to see. 

So this story is a comforting example of divine grace. 
First of all, we know that in the sight of God, there is no 
respect for the person, and we should not judge anyone, 
nor despair of any man. For Jonah's personal standing is 
so low that he considers the Ninevites to be nothing in 
the eyes of God, judges them freshly, and condemns 
them to death as the damned, despairs of their obtaining 
mercy, but hopes and waits for their destruction, and 
thinks badly: "What should sinners be worth, who do not 
have the grace of God? 


856 Erl. 41, 34S-35I. Interpretation of Jonah (1.), Cap. 1, 3-5. 


W. VI, 2616-2618. 857 





law, have no worship? But if they have the grace of God, 
what does Israel do with so much of God's law and 
worship, if they have nothing special nor advantageous 
over the Gentiles, and the Gentiles come to grace 
without such law and worship? Would the law and 
worship of the Jews be a useless, unnecessary toil, 
which they bear all day long with burden and with heat; 
and should they get the same penny without such toil? 
Shouldn't that make them look askance and grumble 
against the father of the house? Yes, should it not be 
impossible and unreasonable in the sight of God? 

(39) But he also fails greatly, and starts confidently. 

For when he thinks that it is impossible that God's grace 
should be there, and that unkindness is there, then it is 
first; And since he thinks that God's word will not be 
heard or accepted, they accept it first of all and most 
humbly, that he must learn by his own experience that 
he should not judge anyone, nor despair of anyone, and 
that he should not put God's grace in place, nor goal, 
nor time, nor measure, nor person, nor merit, as the 
carnal thoughts of the Jews did. 
40. on the other hand, that we should follow God's 
command straight away, and not look at anything else, 
nor first ask how it rhymes with other things, but gladly 
and willingly become fools for God's sake, and give Him 
the honor that He is wise and just in all His words and 
works, just as Abraham did when he sacrificed his son 
Isaac [Gen. 22, 2. ff.] and did not first ask how this 
rhymed with the saying, since God had said before [Cap. 
21, 12.]: "In Isaac shall thy seed be called." For if he had 
wanted to deal with it and ask questions for a long time, 
he would have gone astray and finally fallen into 
disobedience, just as happened to Jonah here: when he 
held Israel and Nineveh against each other and looked 
around for a long time, he fell into disobedience. But if 
he had thought so simply: Why do you ask that God has 
provided Israel with laws and worship and not the 
Ninevites? He can still give his grace on both sides, and 
not let Israel enjoy their worship, and not pay Nineveh 
anything, so that they can live without it. 


God's service. What is it to thee that he commandeth 
Israel such things, and commandeth not others? Let 
every man wait for his own; grace goeth forth 
nevertheless, both on them that work, and on them that 
work not, as Paul teacheth Rom. 4:4, 5; behold, he 
would have remained in obedience with Abraham. 


Vv. 4. But God caused a great wind to come upon 
the sea, so that there was a great tempest in the sea 
2c. 


(41) Here, for the sake of one sin, all others must 
suffer, for for Jonah's sake such a storm comes. Is it 
right, then, that one must repay God for another? But 
God cannot be unjust nor do what He wills, for we have 
no law to lay down for Him, nor commandment to make. 
But where there can be no law, there can be no sin nor 
injustice. However, even though this storm comes for 
Jonah's sake, as he himself says, and the work also 
proves in himself, the people in the ship were not without 
guilt or sin, so that they deserved death and all kinds of 
punishment before God every hour. For who is without 
sin or blameless before God? Therefore he meets them 
here together with Jonah, although Jonah is the cause 
with his sin. 

(42) It must also have been a strange, unpredictable 
weather that came suddenly, because the text says: 
God hurriedly threw a great wind on the sea. For so it 
reads in Hebrew that God caused the wind to come at 
once, as if he threw or pushed it on the sea, with a storm, 
so that people soon noticed that it did not have to 
happen naturally or ordinarily. Therefore they conclude 
without a doubt that it must be because of some sin. So 
Jonah himself realized that it was only for him. 


v. 5 And the people feared, and cried every man 
unto his God. 


(43) Here you see that it is true what St. Paul says in 
Romans 1:19, how God is known by all the Gentiles, that 
is, all the world knows to say about the Godhead, and 
natural reason knows that the Godhead is something 
great above all other things. This is proven by the fact 
that those who call upon God here were pagans. For 
where they knew nothing of God or the 


858 en. 41, 351-354. interpretations on the prophets. 


W. VI, 2618-2621. 859 





Godhead, how would they have called and cried out 
to Him? 

44 Even though they do not really believe in God, 
they still have such a mind and opinion that God is 
such a being who can help in the sea and in all 
troubles. Such light and understanding is in all 
people's hearts and cannot be dimmed or 
extinguished. There have been some, such as the 
Epicureans, Pliny and the like, who deny it with their 
mouths, but they do it by force, and want to dim the 
light in their hearts; they do like those who forcefully 
plug their ears or shut their eyes, so that they neither 
see nor hear. But it does not help them; their 
conscience tells them otherwise. For Paul does not 
lie that God has revealed it to them, that they know 
something about God. 

(45) Let us also learn here from nature and reason 
what to think of God. For this is what these people 
think of God, that he is one who may help from all 
evil. From this it follows that natural reason must 
confess that all good comes from God. For he who 
can help from all evil and misfortune can also give all 
good and happiness. The natural light of reason 
reaches so far that it considers God to be a kind, 
gracious, merciful and mild God. This is a great light. 
46 But there are still two big things missing. The first: 
She believes that God is able and knows how to do, 
to help and to give; but that he wants or is willing to 
do such things for her, she cannot; that is why she 
does not remain firm in her mind. For she believes 
the power and knows it, but she doubts the will, 
because she feels the contradiction in the accident. 
You can see that here. For people call to God, so that 
they confess that he might help if he wanted to; they 
also believe that he wants to help others. Then they 
leave it, they cannot get any higher. For they try all 
their power, do their best and highest. Here free will 
can do no more. But they do not believe that he wants 
to help. For if they believed that, they would not do 
so: they would not throw the equipment and the 
goods out of the ship; they would not run to Jonah 
and call on his God, but would be quiet and seek 
God's help. 





wait. Item, the sea would also have become still 
because of their faith. But now such faith is 
necessary, which does not doubt that God does not 
want to be gracious to others alone, but also to me. 
This is a true, living faith, and a great, rich, strange 
gift of the Holy Spirit, as we will see in Jonah. 

(47) The other is that reason cannot rightly divide 
the Godhead, nor rightly appropriate it to whom alone 
it is due. It knows that God is, but who or which one 
it is that is rightly called God, it does not know, and 
this happened to it just as it happened to the Jews 
when Christ walked on earth and was testified by the 
Baptist John that he was present. Then their hearts 
were troubled, because they knew that Christ was 
among them, walking among the people; but which 
person he was, they knew not. For that Jesus of 
Nazareth was Christ, no man could think. So also the 
reason of the blind cow plays with God, and makes 
vain blunders, and always strikes aside that it is 
called God, which is not God; and again, it is not 
called God, which is God; which it does not do, where 
it does not know that God would be, or would just 
know which or what God would be. That's why she 
plops down like that, and gives the name and divine 
honor, and calls God what she thinks God is, and 
thus never meets the right God, but always the devil 
or her own conceit, which the devil rules. Therefore, 
there is a great difference between knowing that 
there is a God and knowing what or who God is. The 
first is known by nature and is written in all hearts; the 
other is taught by the Holy Spirit alone. 

(48) Let us give examples of this. Let us first 
consider the papists and clergy, who have such 
delusions about God that they think God is one who 
can be moved or satisfied with good works; therefore 
they also have so many ranks, sects and various 
ways of living, so that they all think they are serving 
and pleasing God. Now tell me, if there were no God 
who was so minded or willing, what do such people 
honor for God? Is it not true that they honor their own 
false delusion and conceit for God? For there is no 
God in truth, 


860 en. 41, 354-356. interpretation of Jonah (I.), cap. |, 5. w. 


VI. 2621-2624. 861 





who is so minded, and lacks with such conceit of the 
right God, and nothing remains but their false conceit; 
who is their God, to whom they give the name and 
glory of God. Now no one can be under the false 
conceit, but the devil, who gives it and governs them 
1). So now their false conceit is their idol and image 
of the devil in their heart. For the right, unique, true 
God is the one whom one serves not with works, but 
with right faith from a pure heart, who gives and 
bestows his grace and goods purely for free, without 
works and merit. They do not believe this, therefore 
they do not know him, and they must miss and miss 
by the way. 

(49) You see where all idolatry comes from, and 
why it is called idolatry, idolatry, and idolatry; no 
doubt because such idolatry leads us away from God 
and turns us away from the right service of God. O, 
indeed, an idolatry and an idolatrous faith that leads 
us to the devil, away from God and into hell. For 
because every one undertakes something that 
seems to him, and believes that it pleases God, and 
thinks that God is so minded, who is not so minded, 
and does not please Him; therefore there must be so 
many idolatries, so many conceits, which are 
undertaken, that [it] pleases God so, apart from the 
one conceit of faith which the Holy Spirit gives. Thus 
the abolitionist Baal came upon King Ahab. For the 
king, knowing that there was a God, made himself 
believe that this was God, who would please him in 
the way he worshipped, and so he called God Baal, 
and again Baal he called God, as it seems from 
Hosea Cap. 2, 8. Item, the king Jeroboam thought 
that this would be God, who would let him worship 
before the golden calves. So the calves had to be 
called God Israel, and again, God had to be called a 
calf [1 Kings 12:28]. 

50 Just as if Christ our Lord were now called a 
"caphold" or "platehold," because people think that 
he is a god who is favorable to caps and plates, and 
that such service is pleasing to him, as the monks 
and priests certainly hold him to be and call him in 
their hearts. But it is an apostasy and disbelief, and 
disdain, which is far lacking, 


1) "she" is only in the Wittenberg. 





and an arch-righteous idolatry. So there is no number 
of idolatries, as many are the idiots who choose 
something else that pleases God, without faith in 
Christ. Since there is no such God to whom such 
things are pleasing, they all serve the devil with them, 
and not God. 

(51) So you see here also that these people in the 
ship all know about God, but they have no certain 
God. For each one (says he) called upon his own 
god, that is, his own conceit, or that which he thought 
to be God in his own mind; therefore they all lack the 
one true God, and have vain idols under God's name 
and glory. Therefore their faith was not right, but 
superstition and idolatry, which did them no good. For 
their God makes them fall in trouble and cry out in 
vain, so that they despair and do not know where to 
find a God to help them. And looking down to Jonah, 
they awake him, and bid him call upon his God, if 
there be any other God than their God that will help. 
There you see how false faith does not stand in 
adversity, but sinks and both God and faith, Abba and 
superstition, are lost, so that all that remains is 
despair. Therefore only the one, living God has the 
name and the rhyme that he is a helper in trouble, Ps. 
10, 1. and 46, 2. and everywhere, because he can 
help out of death. Ps. 68, 21. 

52 Thou seest therefore how humble these people 
were, that in trouble they ran to Jonah, whom, when 
it was quiet, they esteemed not; and if they had 
known before that he was a Jew, they would have 
despised him more, as the heathen were enemies to 
the Jews. But now, when adversity comes, and their 
idol sinks them, how glad is their proud contempt, that 
they call upon poor Jonah, and seek more good from 
him than from all their idols, and all their substance. 

(53) This is what the false colored faith does at all 
times; as long as it prospers and stands, it is proud, 
even over God and all that God is, and is so stubborn 
and hard that no anvil was ever so hard. But when he 
begins to sink and to despair, there is nothing more 
stupid nor more despondent in heaven and earth, so 
that he may well crouch in a mouse hole, and 


862 Erl. 41, 356-359. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2624-2627. 


863 





the wide world becomes too narrow for him, and then 
both, with enemies and friends, both, with the 
despised and the highly praised, he seeks help and 
advice, and would gladly accept it. 

Meanwhile Jonah was sleeping in the ship and did 
not feel such a storm. This may well mean a sleep of 
death, which he finally did and soon had to go to his 
death. But this is how it always goes with sinners, 
and God deals with them in this way, just as here with 
Jonah. For Jonah had greatly sinned against God; 
but because God is silent and keeps still with the 
punishment, and does not ward off the sin, or does 
not strike so soon, it is the nature and manner of sin 
that it blinds and hardens man, so that he becomes 
secure, and is not afraid, but lies down and sleeps, 
and does not see what great weather and misfortune 
is upon him, which will awaken him terribly. 

55 Meanwhile God also poses as if he had 
forgotten the sins, because he is so consumed, and 
thus tries what the children of men want to do, 
whether they also want to convert, as the 11th 
Psalm, v. 4, says: "The eyelids of the Lord try the 
children of men. But nothing comes of it, there is no 
turning back, nor is there any hesitation; Jonah would 
sleep all his life long, and if God wanted to forget his 
sin, he would certainly never remember it. 

(56) This is what is meant here in Jonah, that he 

sleeps so deeply and hard in the midst of the storm, 
and also deep down in the ship. As if he should say: 
He is completely blinded, hardened, sunk, even 
dead, and lies in the bottom of the impenitent heart, 
would also lie there eternally, and would be stifled; 
because sin would not allow any power to stir in man 
for good, be it free will or reason, there he lies, and 
snores in his sins, does not hear and see, does not 
feel what God's wrath does and intends for him. 
But when the shipman wakes him up and tells him to 
call upon his God, another thing arises, he becomes 
aware of how God is behind him with the punishment 
and has not forgotten his sins. There the conscience 
comes to life, there the sin comes again and 
becomes alive, there the sin is the sting of death [1 
Cor. 15, 56] and shows the wrath of God. 





God, not only the ship, but the world becomes too 
narrow for him. Yes, that he should call upon God 
here; he is more afraid than anyone in the ship, for 
he feels and realizes, his conscience also tells him, 
that the storm is upon him and that God's wrath has 
come upon him. Oh how humble he is! He absolves 
all who are in the ship and does not consider them 
sinners; he sees no sin except his own. 

(58) For so does the rebuke: when he comes and 
bites and terrifies the conscience, then all the world 
is pious, without him alone is a sinner; all the world is 
gracious to God, without him alone; then God's wrath 
strikes no one but him alone; also thinks that there is 
no other wrath but that which he feels, and so finds 
himself the most wretched of men. He did the same 
with Adam and Heva when they sinned. If God had 
not come when the day was cool, they would never 
have considered sin. But when he came, they hid 
themselves. So Peter also, when he had denied 
Christ, was gone; he felt no sin; he slept also down in 
the ship, and was dead, until Christ looked upon him; 
then he felt again, and wept bitterly. So here we have 
how sin makes a man rigid, insensitive, badly dead, 
so that he feels neither himself nor God, and goes 
safely without fear until God comes and wakes him 
up, so that the glory of free will lies low. 

59. Since Jonah does not call upon his God, but 
sits and cites God's wrath, and bites himself with 
death, which wants to devour him every moment, and 
the people also call upon their gods in vain, and do 
everything they can, and Jonah sees and feels that 
such things happen for his sake; He is not so pious 
as to lead them out and confess his sin, but for his 
sake he lets the poor people suffer such horror and 
suffering and misery, until God forces the sin out of 
him, so that he must confess it, betrayed by his fate. 

(60) This is also the tender redemption of sins, 
that it makes the people dumb, and wants to hide, 
and is ashamed, and would like to remain beautiful, 
just as Adam and Heva covered themselves with the 
aprons, and wanted to be beautiful. 


864 Erl. 41, 359-3K1. Interpretation of Jonah (1.), Cap. 


do not come to confession. O, it grieves me that one 
should expose his own shame, and make his 
ornaments dishonorable. 

But now it must be, or there is no rest nor peace, 
as the 32nd Psalm, v. 3, says: "Because | wanted to 
hide it, my bones became obsolete before my daily 
howling. Thus God also commanded the children of 
Israel to lay aside their ornaments before Mount Sinai 
(Ex. 33:5). That means then rightly, to put on the 
sackcloth and to sit in the ashes, to bring oneself to 
ruin before GOD, also, where GOD wants it, before 
the people. For since Jonah has brought harm and 
danger to the people with his sin, he must suffer harm 
again, lose his honor and disgrace himself, make the 
people honorable and innocent, and also pass 
judgment on his own neck, so that they must drown 
him. So he pays and atones with life and limb, honor 
and property, and with everything he is and has, his 
neighbors whom he has so highly offended. He 
brought them into danger of life without their will, so 
they bring him back to life by his own judgment and 
will, without their will. That is (| mean) strictly and 
rightly judged. 


V. 7 Then one said to the other: Come, let us 
loose 2c. 


(62) Since there is no one here who will confess, 
and yet they thought that someone's sin must have 
caused such unnatural weather, and since human 
judgment is not to be found here, and public judgment 
cannot be held, they run to God's judgment and 
sentence, and seek judgment by lot. Oh, how Jonah 
should have sat there and shunned the lot! as an evil 
conscience does, which is also afraid of a rustling 
leaf. Poor Jonah must suffer so many deaths, and yet 
he does not escape, but comes to the right place 
afterwards. 

(63) Behold, sin causes so much misfortune and 
heartache if one wants to hide it and does not confess 
it, and yet must be confessed afterwards with twofold 
harm. But sin will not let us do otherwise; it will not 
and cannot reveal itself, that is lost. Every man wants 
to be beautiful and pure before men, and yet does not 
secretly want to let go of sin; so he must admit it. 





1,5. 7. W. VI, 2627-2630. 865 
ultimately let others uncover it, and thus have harm 
and shame to pay for it. For one cannot heal the 
wounds that one does not want to expose; so sin 
cannot be forgiven unless it is confessed, that is, 
confessed. 

(64) Here it is asked, Whether the people also 
have sinned in loosing? for loosing is forbidden, as 
tempting God in it. But Jonah also loosed with them; 
therefore Jonah is also in sin, if it is sin. Here | answer 
the first: There are some works of this kind, that they 
may be done well and evil. For swearing is forbidden 
by Christ (Matt. 5:34), and yet a divine oath can be 
taken. It is also forbidden to rage and kill, but it is 
divine to kill and punish evildoers by public judgment. 
Therefore, in such works the opinion of the heart is to 
be considered, that whoever does them out of his 
own desire sins; but whoever does them out of 
command and obedience of God, or out of necessity 
and duty to his neighbor, does well. Whoever does 
them without the command of God, or without the 
duty of his neighbor, out of his own desire or will, let 
him go. For such a one does not do well even if he 
lies on his knees all day praying and fasting day and 
night, or even if he performs miraculous signs. 
Therefore let this be put to each man's conscience; 
we may not judge his heart. Now if the loosing is also 
such a work, it is of no consequence whether these 
people sinned together with Jonah, for they were 
unbelievers, and otherwise all their works were not 
pleasing to God, until afterwards, when they were 
converted, as follows. 

(65) Secondly, | say that | am not yet aware that 
loosening is a forbidden work. It is indeed forbidden 
not to tempt God; but loosing and tempting God are 
far apart. For even the apostles, Apost. 1, 26, spoke 
of St. Matthew. Thus Solomon says: "The lot is cast 
into the lock, but it is mastered by the Lord" [Proverbs 
16:33]. There he does not reject the lot, but rather 
confirms it, although some fathers say that one 
should not follow such examples. But they have no 
reason to do so. Methinks that loosening is in itself a 
work of faith, and may 


866 Erl. 41, 361-363. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI. 2630-2632. 


867 





may well be abused by arrogance and their own lust, 
as of the sword and oath; but this is not the fault of 
the work, but of the person, as has been said. So they 
also do not prove that loose is tempting God. For that 
is tempting God, when |, for myself and my own 
foresight, without any need, set God a certain goal, 
hour, place, measure, person, way and work, which 
he should do, and thus let it be clearly remembered. 
As when the Jews in the desert demanded food and 
drink for a certain time [Ex. 16, 1. ff.], and did not trust 
him nor did they return home. As also the Jews Luc. 
11, 29. demanded a sure sign from heaven, which 
seemed good to them. But in the lot such does not 
happen, but there two, three, or how many they are, 
become one, and make a covenant about one thing, 
to pay in such and such a way, as the lot is then in 
many ways, and agree no certain persons, but 
command such to God, whom the lot will meet, and 
are beforehand of the things one, that whom it meets, 
it shall be, as ordered by God. 

(66) Would that one could do this kind of gambling 
without God, freely, like the pagans, who do not 
believe that God masters the lot, but that luck gives it 
all, as happens in dice and other games of chance. 
But it behooves Christians not to lose so freely, but 
to believe that God controls the lot and luck, and not 
to doubt that God gives and takes away everything 
that is given or taken away by the lot and the game. 
One must do and take oaths in such a way that one 
believes that God is there who accepts the oath and 
judges each one according to it. But because one 
does not vote how he should judge, but puts it home 
to him, and is satisfied with it, it is no temptation. So 
also, because one does not vote in the lot to which 
he should give it, but puts it there freely at God's 
counsel, and is satisfied, it is also not tempting God, 
but a good work in himself, and if it is done in faith, a 
divine work that is done in his honor. For whoever 
gets something by lot, that is his, and whoever would 
take it from him would be doing evil against God. And 
what is a lot but a covenant, that we become one 
among ourselves over one thing? 





Thing, which we put in the road, to whom it becomes 
by the lot. Here is nothing evil, but a peaceful union 
and consent to do without or to have the thing, 
according to which the knife wears sometimes or not, 
after it is even or odd, and so on. Without Christians 
adding that they believe that as God does and sends 
all things, so he does and sends them; which the 
heathen do not believe, or do not respect. 

67 But how? if it is such a lot that one comes to 
death over it, and his secret sin is sought? as 
happens here with Jonah, and as Saul did with his 
son Jonathan [1 Sam. 14:42 ff], and Joshua with 
Achan, Jos. 7:18, 19. Here | answer: The unbelievers 
may loose to death or to life, through arrogance or 
earnestness; what is it to us what those do who do 
nothing right? But the lot in itself does not entail that 
anyone should be put to death; neither do the 
Christians and the pious take any lot for it. For here 
you also see that the people in the ship did not intend 
to kill Jonah, but only sought the cause of such 
misfortune, so that they would stop it. For they would 
not kill Jonah, though he bade them, but would go 
with him to land. But since they could not, they saw 
that God wanted it, as Jonah had said, and they had 
to do it, though reluctantly, and prayed diligently 2c. 
So Saul also did wrong in wanting to kill his son, for 
he should not let the lot go so far. It was different with 
Joshua, who was thus commanded by God how he 
should do it. Why should these people not make a 
covenant that the one whom the lot should fall should 
be guilty? Especially because necessity urges them 
to save others, and God is so pious and right that he 
does not let the lot err; just as they are without guilt, 
that they consider him innocent who takes the oath, 
when he may well swear falsely and be guilty. But 
that is enough for this time. 


V. 9. lam a Hebrew, and fear GOD from heaven, who 
made the sea and [the] dry land. 

Here confession comes and brings sin to light. 
There also goes the right 


868 en. 41, 363-366. interpretation of Jonah (1.), Cap. 1,9. 12. W. VI, 2632-2636. 869

Jonah, the heavy burden of sins is partly lifted from) 71 Now this is the way of all the wicked, that they

(69) For a conscience that is completely desperate 
and despondent does not open its mouth so much, 
but falls silent or blasohemes God, and cannot think, 
hold or speak of God other than as of a horrible tyrant, 
or as of the devil, and would only like to flee from him 





and respect sin, but they do not respect punishment 
so much, they would rather remain in punishment 
without sin than in sin without punishment. 

But that Jonah says here: "I fear God from 
heaven" is spoken in Hebrew, because worship is 
called the fear of God, as can be seen in Isaiah Cap. 


and be far away, yes, would rather that he were not] 29, 13, where he says: "They fear me with the

of it, because it keeps the sin on it. So it remains 
eternally stuck in sin and death. 

70 From this let us learn what is the right art and the} 
right way to get out of all trouble and fear, namely, tha’ 
one should be careful of all sins; quickly out with them 
and freely confessed, so that there is never so much 
trouble or distress. For the heart must be helped first o 
all, so that it becomes lighter and gets air; then the whol 
body is to be advised all the more. Thus, the conscience 
must first be rescued from its burden and be given breath, 
and then all distress will be well advised. For in such 
case, when God's wrath comes, the two pieces are there, 
sin and fear. Wherever there are hearts that have no} 
understanding, they take a wrong and unjust approach t 
the matter, leaving the sin where it is, and looking only t 
the fear for help in getting rid of it. This does not help, and 
so they must despair. And in this way all reason does, 
unless grace and the Spirit are with it. But where there 
are hearts of understanding, they are so disposed tha 
they turn their senses away from fear, and most of all the 
look at sin, that 





until that very hour. But he wants to say: | do not 
honor and serve strange gods, like you and other 
pagans, but the one and right God. 

(73) And Jonah's sin and shame were the greater, 
that he, who was the servant of the right God, and of 
the most holy land and people, should be found the 
worst and greatest sinner before all the other 
idolatrous nations, that even for his sake the 
idolatrous nations should have to suffer trials and 
distress, when usually other sinners are helped by 
the servants of God, as King Ahab and his 
descendants were helped by Elijah and Elisha. Here 
it is completely the other way around. There the 
wicked enjoy the pious; here the wicked must repay 
the pious, and thus the most pious becomes the 
least, the first the last. This is also why he was 
ashamed to confess his sins before the people, 
because he did not want to be worse than the 
Gentiles, and yet he had to be. 


Vv. 12 Cast me into the sea, and the sea shall be still 
unto you: for | know that for my sake such weather 
cometh upon you. 


Here let us see in Jonah what the faith of a pure 
heart is capable of doing, and 


870 Erl. 41, 386-368. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2638-2639. 


What he can do. There stands the excellent 
example of faith, of which we have said above 
[Preface § 4], how it is as it were omnipotent, and 
triumphs in all things that are against it. 

First, he takes the sin on himself from the 
others, and confesses that for his sake such 
weather has come; thus he releases and absolves 
all others, and remains a sinner alone, so that the 
others must all be pious. Hereby he does enough 
for love, and atones for what he has done to the 
people, since he brought them into such danger, 
and lets it all pass over him. And there again love 
finds a fine, grateful place. For the good people 
do not desire such high repentance, and would 
gladly give him the sin, let them be content with 
the public confession and confession, again strive 
with all their might to help him back to the land, 
and thus repay love with love; but it will not be. 

Secondly, he takes upon himself and bears 

before God such a conscience of sin that he also 
becomes a sinner and a disgrace before God, 
when his heart testifies and confesses most 
powerfully that he has forfeited both to God and 
to man. This disgrace is now a thousand times 
greater, that one must become ashamed before 
God. For at the same time there is neither a corner 
nor a hole in all creatures, not even in hell, where 
one could crawl, but must let all creatures look at 
him, and stand before them with all shame, as the 
evil consciences well feel when they are rightly 
struck. For you must not look at Jonah here when 
he is redeemed and restored to honor, but how he 
is in disgrace and does not see where he should 
come out more and more. For if a heart knew or 
saw such things, the shame and the conscience 
would not hurt him so much. But God puts all 
honor and comfort out of sight, and leaves all 
shame there. That is the misery. 
Thirdly, death naturally follows sin as the 
punishment, as St. Paul says in 1 Cor. 15:56: "The 
law is the power of sins, but sin is the sting or edge 
of death. So Jonah sees here that there is nothing 
left, because the 





871 


bitter death, gives himself up and pronounces a 
verdict on his own life: "Throw me into the sea. 
As if he should say: I must die, otherwise it will 
not be quiet. For once you do not have to look at 
Jonah here as history looks at us. For since we 
have before us the whole story of how he was 
redeemed, it seems small to us, and moves us 
little. But you must see how Jonah's courage is in 
this affliction: he does not see a single bit more of 
life, nor of salvation; but only death, death, death 
is there, so that he must despair of life and 
surrender to death. For if God dealt with us in 
such a way that he would let us see life in death, 
or showed our soul the place and space, the way 
and manner, where it should appear and stand, 
where it should also go and remain, then death 
would not be bitter, but would be like a leap over 
a shallow stream, where one sees and feels a 
certain bottom and bank on both sides. But now 
he shows us none, and we have to jump over from 
the certain shore of this life into the abyss, where 
there is no feeling, nor seeing, nor feet, nor 
standing, but free on God's counsel and 
abstention, just as Jonah is thrown out of the ship 
here, so that he falls into the sea, since he feels no 
ground, and abandoned by all creatures, he sails 
along solely on God's abstention. 

Fourth, in death he also bears God's wrath. For 
he feels how death comes upon him not out of 
grace, but out of wrath, earned through his sin. 
Now death would still have to be suffered, and not 
so completely through bitterness, if it came 
without God's wrath, as it comes when someone 
is unjustly condemned for God's sake, as the holy 
martyrs, who know that men do wrong to them 
before God. Therefore, because they have a good 
cause before God, they are sure that God is 
merciful and not angry; therefore, death is not 
recognized as coming from God's anger, but from 
grace and good pleasure. 1) But where death is 
caused and earned by sin, the wrath of God goes 
with it, and makes death un- 

1) In this sentence there is a Latin way of construction. We would 


now say: Therefore it is also recognized that death does not come 
from God's wrath, but from His grace and good pleasure. 


872 Erl. 41, 368-371. interpretation of Jonah (I.), cap. 


I, 12. 2, 1. W. VI, 2639-2641. 873 





It is bearable that nothing but death is to be found and 
felt there. 

79. Now you see, each of these four pieces by itself 
is hard to bear, even for the saints, and definitely for the 
wicked. For who is so strong as to have a cheerful mind 
or peace of heart when he feels God's wrath upon him, 
even if he does not die? It has made many godless 
people mad and senseless. So too, who is he who does 
not shun death and trembles at it, even if he does not 
feel the wrath of God, nor know it, like the pagans, or 
feel a merciful God, like the saints. So there is no greater 
burden on earth than sin and conscience. For who can 
suffer to be disgraced before God and the world? Who 
would not rather be dead than live? But on this poor 
Jonah these pieces fall all at once, urging and 
frightening him to despair of God's grace and to fall from 
the faith. What a struggle there was in his heart! He 
might have sweated blood from fear; he had to fight 
against his sin, against his own conscience and the 
feelings of his heart, against death and against God's 
wrath all at once; his soul would have hung by a silken 
thread over hell and eternal damnation. Oh, it is a great 
thing committed in the heart by God's power that he has 
remained and been preserved. For the fact that he 
remained in faith proves his salvation; God does not help 
the wicked out of such death and misery. Thus he 
himself confesses that he is God's servant and gives 
himself up to the punishment, which all the wicked are 
incapable of doing, but all despair in sins. 

80 He has even more misfortune on top of that, for 
the fifth time. The sea becomes his deathbed, so that he 
must die alone, and there is no one around him to 
comfort him, but the people with the ship sail away, and 
leave him there in the middle of the sea, as surely 
drowned and lost. 

And sixthly, there is still no end in the sea, and one 
death is not enough, it must also go into the mouth of 
the whale. So that God has let himself be looked upon 
as if he were so angry that he would not be satisfied with 
the death and punishment to which Jonah willingly 
surrenders, but could not be satisfied with the death and 
punishment of the whale. 


not take revenge on him horribly enough. For the mouth 
of the whale could not have been anything other than a 
terrible image to poor, lost and dying Jonah, when the 
mouth of the fish opened so wide and the sharp teeth 
stood around like pointed pillars or beams, and such a 
wide neck of the cellar into the belly. 

Is this comforting in death? Is this the friendly view in 
dying, that dying and death should not be enough? That 
is (| mean) a faith, yes a fight and dispute of faith, there 
is a victory and triumph hidden under the greatest 
weakness. How God shows us here what His word and 
faith are able to do, that all creatures may not break 
anything from Him, nor God's wrath itself, even if 
everything rages in the highest and most horrible way. 
But Jonah had to show all the world how his heart stood, 
and how every believer's heart stands in the same 
temptation, as we will hear hereafter. For just as the sea 
with all its impetuosity wants to drown Jonah, and the 
whale swallows him up and wants to consume him, so 
the conscience feels the impetuosity of God's wrath and 
death, and wants hell and eternal damnation to devour 
the soul. 2c. 


Cap. 2, 1. And Jonah was three days and three 
nights in the belly of the fish. 


These have been the longest days and nights that 
have ever come under the sun, if you look at Jonah's 
thoughts. For it must have seemed a long time to him 
that he had sat there in darkness; indeed, | think he had 
lain and stood at times. He saw neither the sun nor the 
moon, and could not even count the hours; he also did 
not know where he had sailed around in the sea with the 
fish. How often may his lungs and livers have beaten 
him? How wondrous was his dwelling there among the 
entrails and great ribs? But he was so caught up in death 
that he did not care much about the fish, and always 
thought: When, when, when will it end? Help God, what 
a wonderful work this is! Who can sufficiently consider 
that a man should spend three days and nights so 
lonely, without light, 


874 Erl. 41, 371-373. 


Interpretations on the Prophets. W. VI, 2641-2645. 


875 





without food, in the middle of the sea, in the fish live 
and come back? This may well be called a strange 
voyage. Who would believe it, and not consider it a lie 
and a fairy tale, if it were not written in the Scriptures? 

God has thus shown us how powerfully he has 
death and all things in his hands, and how easy it is 
for him to help us, even in unspeakable and 
desperate distresses, which we find so hard to 
believe. He is present everywhere, in death, in hell, in 
the midst of the enemies, yes, even in their hearts. 
For he made it all, and governs it all, so that it must 
do what he wills. 

85 But it is written for our sakes, and for our sakes 
his omnipotence is so marvelously proved, that we 
should trust him, and believe that we are in death, or 
in the hands of the enemy. For for his sake he was 
not permitted to do it nor to have it written, neither may 
Jonah for his own sake have it written. And although 
all the world knows how to speak of divine 
omnipotence, and it seems easy for anyone to believe 
when he hears it spoken; but experience shows how 
many believe it with a right heart, since one should 
risk life and limb on such words of the omnipotence of 
God, and even through death and sin experience that 
it is true as the word of it sounds. This experience is 
hard to suffer even for the greatest saints. But it is 
comforting to know and to know such examples, as 
the prophet in the Psalter praises [Ps. 119, 52]: "Lord, 
| remembered your deeds, they comfort me" 2c. 





86. Now Jonah is gone, and has died to the world 
and to himself, so that there is no hope of his life (for 
these people in the ship do not know otherwise, he 
must drown and die, because they ask God, he will 
not let them perish for Jonah's soul, nor ascribe 
innocent blood to them: So that they confess that 
they will not see Jonah anywhere except in death, 
and must help to kill him in obedience to God's will, 
however unwillingly), the life and fruit of Jonah's 
death comes first, for he is kept alive in death. In this 
way, people are also delivered from death, as well as 
from unbelief and sins, and brought to the knowledge 
of God, so that they become pious and true servants 
of God, so humble and fearful that they are also 
afraid of sins, since obedience to God is the only 
thing that matters. For they would gladly keep Jonah 
alive, and fear murder, that they might drown him; 
and yet they see that God wills it so. How pure, God- 
fearing and Christian consciences they have there: 
who before would not have asked for any murder nor 
God's obedience, go to, and sacrifice and vow to 
God! Forgotten are all the various gods they called 
upon before. And all this happens because of Jonah 
and his death. A servant of God must be so useful 
that there is nothing in him to benefit others. What 
fear of God means is said above [§ 72], namely, 
service to God. For true worship is to fear and honor 
God. So these people also feared God, that is, they 
became God's servants and God-fearing people.

877 





of his salvation, but did not think otherwise than that 
it must have died, and thus tasted and felt death, and 
died without ceasing. But after that, when he 
recovered and came to life again, he thought behind 
him and wrote such a prayer in writing, to praise God 
and for the benefit of men. 

2 Now come here, whoever is so forward and 
would like to know how the dead are. For there are 
many who would have liked to ask Lazarum what he 
had done, thought, felt and seen when he lay four 
days in the grave, John 11:44, and also other dead 
people whom Christ and the prophets and apostles 
raised from death. But some reckless talkers come in 
and write how they have seen such a horrible thing, 
so that they have never been happy all their lives. 
The others leave it at the saying Weish. 2, 1: "No one 
has ever come from the dead" to tell us how things 
are there. 

(3) But | will leave Lazarum and other dead men 
here, and keep the scripture, which saith, They sleep. 
For methinks that such sleep hath them so 
completely inward, that they neither feel nor see 
anything, much less as one feels in natural sleep; 
and when they are raised, let it happen unto them, 
that they know not where they have been. Let us take 
these before us, who do not sleep like this, and yet 
are dead, and in death feel death and hell, which we 
still consider to be alive; but to reckon by their feeling 
(according to which it is to be reckoned, and not 
according to our appearance) they are dead, and 
there is no more life; let them tell us the right truth, 
and atone for the presumption, as it goes after this 
life, especially the wicked. 


V. 3. | called upon the Lord in my affliction, and he 
answered me. | cried out to my God in the belly of hell, 
and you heard my voice. 


4 First, he begins to praise God's grace and help, and 
to give thanks that he has helped him out of his 
distress, thus holding us up first to God's goodness, 
then to his distress, from which he has been helped. 
And this first verse teaches us two great and 
necessary lessons. The first, that one must first of all 
go to God. 


Run and cry out to him in distress and complain to 
him. For God cannot leave it alone, he must help him 
who cries out and calls; his divine goodness cannot 
abstain, it must hear. It is only a matter of calling and 
crying out to him, and do not remain silent; only 
straighten up the head, and lift up the hands, and 
quickly call out: Help God, my Lord 2c., and you will 
soon feel that it will be better. If you can call out and 
cry out, there is no more need. For even hell would 
not be hell, nor would it remain hell, if one cried and 
screamed to God in it. For if thou wilt weep and wail 
much, and be long in biting and gnawing with 
affliction, or look about thee for help, it is lost: thou 
shalt not get out of it, but in deeper. Listen to what 
Jonah did. He was also lukewarm with fear before he 
cried out, as he himself will say later. Otherwise he 
would have been saved sooner. He is also called and 
teaches you not to do this, and to follow him, but 
quickly he starts at the front, as he has called, and so 
is redeemed. 

But no one can believe how difficult it is to do such 
crying and screaming. We can weep and lament, 
tremble and doubt, and put ourselves in the most 
terrible position, but we will not cry out. For there the 
evil conscience and sin presses under us and lies on 
our necks; there it strikes that we feel God's wrath. 
These are such burdens that the whole world is not 
so heavy. In short, it is impossible for nature alone or 
for an ungodly person to stand up against such a 
burden and immediately call upon God Himself, who 
is angry and punishes, and not run to anyone else. 
As lsaiah writes many times that the people did not 
turn to God who struck them [Isa. 9:13]. Nature is 
rather clever that it flees from God when he is angry 
or punishes, let alone that it should turn to him and 
call upon him, and always seeks help elsewhere, and 
does not want this God, and cannot stand him; 
therefore it also flees forever, and yet does not 
escape, and thus must remain damned in anger, sin, 
death and hell. 

6 And here you see a great piece of hell, how 
sinners fare after this life, namely, that they flee God's 
wrath, 


878 Erl. 41, 375-377. 


Interpretations on the Prophets. 


W. VI, 2648-2651. 879 





and never escape, yet do not cry out to him nor call 
out to him. But again Isaiah Cap. 28:16: "He that 
trusteth in Christ the cornerstone shall not flee." As if 
to say, "All the wicked flee forever from God and His 
wrath, and yet cannot escape; from which fearful 
fleeing the faithful are safe through Christ. 

(7) Nature can neither do nor be suitable in any 
other way than how it feels. But now that she feels 
God's wrath and punishment, she thinks no 
differently of God than of an angry tyrant, cannot rise 
above such wrath, or leap above such feeling, and 
through it, against God, reach out to God and call. 
Therefore, when Jonah came so far away that he 
cried out, he had won. So think and do thou also. Do 
not bow down your head or blubber, but stand still 
and think about yourself, and you will know that this 
verse is true [Ps. 118:5]: "| cried out to the Lord in my 
anguish, and he answered me." To the Lord, to the 
Lord, and nowhere else, even to Him who wraths and 
punishes, and to no one else. 

But the answer is that it will soon be better, and 
you will soon feel that the wrath will be soothed and 
the punishment softer. He will not leave you 
unanswered, if you can only call, and no more than 
you can call. For he does not ask about your merits, 
knows well that you are a sinner and deserve the 
wrath. He does not punish you otherwise. But nature 
cannot leave that either: it always wants to bring 
something that reconciles God, and finds nothing. 
For it believes and does not know that calling alone 
is enough to appease God's wrath, as Jonah teaches 
us here. 

(9) Thus are all men done. If God neither wraths nor 
punishes, but gives enough and does us good, we are 
so bold, daring, proud and meager that no one can get 
along with us. No scorn, no terror, no example of God's 
wrath helps, it is all mockery and contempt. But again, 
when God punishes, we are so despondent and stupid 
that no consolation, no kindness, no grace can raise us 
up or strengthen us. Thus, as God does with us, we are 
of no use. Behold, how proud the peasants, how 
despondent the lords 





were in this next horrible uproar. Neither pleading nor 
terror helped the peasants, neither consolation nor 
admonition helped the lords. Now again, there is no 
measure of their defiance and arrogance among the 
lords, but once again, neither entreaty nor terror 
helps until they feel God's wrath again. Kind does not 
leave kind. 

(10) The other teaching is that we should cry out 
in such a way that we also feel in our hearts that it is 
such a cry that God answers, and also may boast 
with Jonah that God answers us when we cry out in 
distress. Now this is nothing else than calling with 
right faith of the heart; for the head cannot be lifted 
up, nor the hands lifted up, but the heart is lifted up 
first. Whoever thus aligns himself, as | have said, that 
he runs to the wrathful God by the help of the Spirit, 
and seeks mercy under the wrath, lets God punish 
him, and yet may comfort himself at the same time 
with His goodness. Then notice what a sharp face 
the heart must have, which is surrounded with vain 
anger and punishment from God, and yet sees and 
feels neither punishment nor anger, but grace and 
goodness, that is, it does not want to see or feel 
them, although it sees and feels them to the highest 
degree, and wants to see and feel grace and 
goodness, although they are hidden to the deepest 
degree. 

(11) Behold, it is such a great thing to come to 
God, that one may break to Him through His wrath, 
through punishment and disgrace, than through vain 
thorns, yea, through vain spears and swords. This is 
a cry of faith, which must be felt in the heart, that it 
may meet God; just as Christ felt that a power had 
gone out from Him when He stopped the woman's 
bleeding [Marc. 5, 30]. For the word and work of the 
Spirit are felt to meet and not to fail. But those who 
cry out and pray to the wind that it does or does not 
come to pass are nothing and accomplish nothing; it 
is more a mockery and hypocrisy before God. 

(12) The other part of this verse is the same as 
that which is now spoken. For it is one thing to cry 
unto the Lord in trouble, and to get an answer; and to 
cry unto God out of the belly of hell, and to have the 
voice heard. But he shows it twice, that 


880 Erl. 41, 377-380. interpretation of Jonah (1.), Cap. 


2, 3. 4. W. VI, 2651-2654. 881 





so that it is all the more certain, and we believe it all 
the more constantly, that it is so, as he says, in the 
sight of God. For the Scriptures have a way of saying 
one thing twice in succession, so that it is certain, as 
Joseph 1 Mos. 41, 25. also points the two dreams of 
Pharaoh to one thing, because of the reasons that it 
is certain 2c. 

013 But when he saith, In the belly of hell, he 
meaneth the belly of the fish, and calleth it the belly 
of hell: not that the fish is hell, but that the belly was 
unto him as much as hell, and Jonah hath his hell 
within; even as he would speak: Out of the belly of 
death; not that the fish is death, but that Jonah suffers 
his death within. For he does not say here what the 
fish is, but how it was to his mind in the fish, namely, 
that he was afraid it would lead down into hell, when 
it went into the belly of the fish, and might well say, 
Out of the belly of my hell, or out of that which was 
my hell. 

14 But what hell is before the last day, | am not 
yet too sure. For that there should be a special place, 
where the damned souls are now inside, as the 
painters paint, and the belly servants preach, | 
consider nothing. For the devils are not yet in hell, 
but, as Peter says [2. Ep. 2, 4.], "bound with cords to 
hell", St. Paul calls them [Eph. 6, 12.] "rulers of the 
world and mighty men who hover above in the air"; 
Christ also calls the devils "princes of the world" [Joh. 
14, 30.]. And indeed it could not be, if they were in 
hell, that they ruled the world, and did so much 
mischief and sorrow; the chastisement would well 
resist them. The Scriptures also speak of many saints 
as going down to hell, as Jonah did here. Item, like 
Job [Cap. 17, 13.j and as Jacob 1 Mos. 37, 35. says: 
"| must go down into hell sorrowful to my son." 

(15) For this reason, the Scriptures almost use the 
word Sheol to indicate the final distress and anguish of 
those who die. For as they are minded, so it speaks. But 
it seems to them that they are going down to hell, that is, 
they are sinking into God's wrath, even though they 
know no place where they can go. 


go there. For everyone has his hell with him where he 
is, as long as he feels the last hardships of death and 
God's wrath. In this way, St. Peter interprets Acts 2, 
27, the 16th Psalm, v. 10, of Christ: "You will not leave 
my soul in hell," 2c., and says, v. 24: "God has 
dissolved the pains of death"; that St. Peter wants to 
mean that through the pains of hell Christ felt when 
he died on the cross and sank there, and went into 
God's power. But on the last day it will be a different 
thing, because a special place will be hell, or because 
those will become very, who are so damned in hell or 
eternal wrath of God. But enough of that. It does not 
matter much whether someone thinks about hell, as 
itis painted and said. It will be so and still much worse 
now and then, because 1) someone can say, paint or 
think. 


V. 4 Thou didst cast me into the deep in the midst 
of the sea, and the floods compassed me about. All 
your waves and billows went over me. 


(16) Now here he tells the pieces in which one can 
see how his heart stood before he cried out to God, 
and faith in the battle, and was almost defeated. Then 
he forgets the people who threw him into the sea and 
says: God has done it. "You (he says), you were the 
one who warned me" 2c. 

For so it is in the conscience, that all misfortune 
that befalls us is God's wrath, and all creatures seem 
to be vain God and God's wrath, even if it is a rustling 
leaf, as Moses says [8rd book, 26, 36. 1: "It shall 
frighten them with a rustling leaf". Is it not a great 
wonder? Nothing is less and more despicable than a 
scrawny leaf that lies on the ground, where all the little 
worms run over it, and cannot resist a little stick, so 
that even Job, when he wanted to estimate himself in 
the least, could find nothing less than that he 
compares himself before God to a scrawny mat [Job 
13, 25.Nor, when the hour cometh, shall horse, man, 
spear, harness, kings, princes, all the host, and all the 
power, be afraid of his noise; and such defiant, 
thunderous, and sovereign as he is, shall not be 
afraid of him. 


1) In the original: when. 


882 Erl. 41, 380-382.

883 





and angry tyrants, who otherwise cannot be 
frightened by any hell, nor by any wrath of God, nor 
by any judgments, but only become more proud and 
hardened by it. Are we not fine fellows? Before God's 
wrath we are not afraid, and stand stiffly, and yet fear, 
and flee from the wrath of an impotent dry leaf; and 
such a leaf's rustling shall make the world too narrow 
for us, and become our wrathful God, who before 
could throb and defy heaven and earth. We may 
indeed boast of our strength and power. If a dry leaf 
can do this over us, what should not the deep sea do, 
as Jonah says here about it? Yes, what will the hellish 
fire do on the last day, and the majesty of God himself 
with all the angels and creatures? 

(18) Neither saith he, The waves and the billows 
of the sea are gone over me; but, Thy waves, and thy 
billows; because he feeleth in his conscience how the 
sea with her waves and her billows serve God and 
his wrath to punish sin. And says, "All the waves and 
billows went over me." For so he feels and feels as if 
all the waters of heaven and earth were upon him, 
and there were none else whom God's wrath 
oppresses but him, but all creatures, with God, 
against him. So also speak some who are in great 
anguish: Methinks heaven and earth are upon me. 
Now these are the right pieces and chastisements 
that come upon sinners after this life. Thus the wrath 
of God and his judgment begin and endure forever. 
This verse is similar to Psalm 42:8, where the 
prophet also says: "All your waves and your waves 
went over me." And Jonah may have taken it from the 
same Psalm. 


V. 5 For | thought that | would be cast out of your 
sight, that | would no longer see your holy temple. 


019 And the punishment was upon the conscience. 
For he wanted to flee from the Lord, so that he would 
not go to Nineveh; that was his sin and disobedience. 
Now he feels how he must be cast out from the 
presence of the LORD, as a punishment he does not 
like, who did not want to stay in the presence of God 
before, because of his sin and disobedience. 


Sin. Then his heart beat, and said, Behold, | think 
thou hast fled rightly, and art come far enough from 
the Lord. Sin bites at the same time, and 
chastisement also presses. 

(20) But it may be understood in two ways that he 
was cast out of God's sight. In the first, bodily, so that 
his heart decided that he must die, and despaired that 
he should always come back to life, and walk again 
among his people before God in the land of Israel, 
from which he had fled. As we heard above [Cap. 1, 
§ 22], that "to flee from the presence of the Lord" was 
that he fled from the land of Israel, where God dwelt 
and where God's service was. Just as it is often said 
in the other book of Kings that God has removed 
Israel from His presence and is threatening to remove 
Judah also from His presence, that is, from the land 
where His word and service were. This understanding 
is given in the following passage, where he says: "I 
would no longer see your holy temple, which was at 
Jerusalem. With this he testifies that he was in the 
throes of death, and completely surrendered, he 
would be of death. Faith was in great distress and 
anguish; there was not much crying out to God, but 
only despair of life. And is it not a wonder who would 
hope for life in such a case, if he had been swallowed 
up and sunk in the deep sea and in the whale? 1) 

21 Secondly, spiritually, that he felt as if he had 
also been eternally rejected by God because of his 
disobedience, like the damned. Just as David in the 
Psalter often says this, as in Psalm 31:23: "I said in 
my anguish, | am rejected from thy presence.” And 
this, of course, is what sin brings with it in the 
conscience, especially in death. That is why Jonah 
certainly felt the same way, and also stood in the 
struggle with despair of God's grace and mercy 
before he came to faith again and called out. Then all 
kinds of examples of God's wrath occurred to him, 
since he punished the sinners, as Adam and Heva, 
Cain, the flood, 


1) In the German editions: "versunken war", but the Latin has 
correctly: absorbkretur. 


884 Erl. 41, 382-384. interpretation of Jonah (I.), Cap. 


2, 5-8. W. VI, 2656-2659. 885 





Sodom and Gomorrah. This is also one of the right 
pieces of the hellish torment that will come over the 
wicked after this life. And you see here in the two 
pieces, what the sinners do after this life, think and 
do, that there is only fear of death and distress, 
trembling and despair forever. But Jonah came to 
such thoughts and despair because he felt the wrath 
and punishment of God bodily and outwardly, as he 
was thrown into the deep and surrounded by the 
floods, overtaken by waves and billows, when he said 
above, v. 4, and told further, and said: 


V. 6 For the waters compassed me about to my life; 
the deep compassed me about, the reeds covered my 
head. 


(22) How could | be assured of life, or be 
comforted, when | was caught in waters round about, 
as in the midst of the sea, and reeds stood over me, 
and covered me? This is said: At the edge and shore 
of the sea and large lakes or ponds reeds and canes 
are used to grow. Now he who is drowned in the sea 
lies covered under the reeds, that is, under the water, 
since reeds grow inside; so that everything that is in 
the sea and around the sea has him under it, even 
the earth on the shore; as follows. 


V. 7. | sank down to the bottom of the mountains; 
the earth had shut me up forever. 

(23) For all the seas, lakes, and deep waters are 

in the bottoms between mountains; they cannot abide 
on the level land. So now the deepest valley of the 
mountains and the bottom of the sea, where the 
mountains meet at the bottom, are the bottoms of the 
mountains. Jonah speaks all these things as one who 
is drowned in the sea and thinks about himself, or as 
one who is entitled to or thinks about one who is 
drowned. For when he thinks about himself, he sees 
the waves of water above him, and on either side the 
shore, reeds, and land or earth. Because he then 
sinks and sinks, it is as if he sinks down to the ground 
between mountains. 
(24) Then the earth has locked him up forever, that is, 
he does not think otherwise than that he must remain 
there and can never come out again. For like one who 
must remain in the tower or prison, so the 





If the door and the window are locked, he too must 
remain in the sea where he sinks. So the earth, that 
is, the mountains, where the sea is between, has 
locked him up, that is, caught him with water and kept 
him so that he cannot get out. Now you see what 
thoughts Jonah had in the whale. Eating and drinking 
and all things are well forgotten; only he fights with 
deadly thoughts; yes, he despairs of life, and is 
completely at death's door. There is still no call to 
God. 


You have brought my life out of destruction, 0 
Lord, my God. 

(25) Now here it wants to become better, and 
other thoughts want to come; there faith raises its 
head and wants to win; there the despondent 
thoughts subside. Just when | was deepest in death, 
and had the least hope, and it was impossible for me 
to live, you came with your power and miraculous 
work, and brought my life out of death and 
destruction. So, when the rope holds hardest, it 
breaks. That is why God is called a helper of 
emergencies, that he helps when all things are 
desperate and impossible. But how does he do when 
he helps like this? Listen: 


V. 8 When my soul was in despair, | remembered 
the Lord, and my prayer came to you in your holy 
temple. 

26. First, he gives grace and the Spirit to lift up the 
heart so that it remembers God's mercy, and lets go 
of thoughts of anger, turning from God the Judge to 
God the Father. But this is not man's power. For 
Jonah speaks here: "his soul had despaired with 
him". Fear was its power and work. But that he 
remembers the Lord and begins to believe, that is not 
the work of his soul; the spirit, and no one else, can 
remember the Lord. 

But when the memory of the Lord enters the heart, 
a new light arises, life looks forward again, the heart 
is again bold to call and to ask, and it is certainly 
heard. This is what Jonah says in the third 1) verse: 
"| 


1) In the original: in the first. 


886 Erl. 41, 384-386. - Interpretations on the Prophets. 


W. VI, 2659-2662. 887 





cried out to the Lord in my anguish, and he answered 
me." Here, death, wrath, sin, hell and all destruction 
have come to an end, and are all overcome and 
swallowed up through faith, based on God's 
goodness. 

But when he says: "My prayer came to you in your 
holy temple", he means the temple in Jerusalem, 
where God dwelled in the flesh at that time. For the 
people of Israel had the law that they had to worship 
nowhere except where God's place was, which He 
had appointed and chosen, as He says in Exodus 
20:24: "Where | make remembrance of My name, 
there will | come and bless thee.” So all those who 
wanted to pray, in the land or out of the land, had to 
direct their prayers there and set their hearts on the 
place where God dwelt bodily through His Word, so 
that they would worship no other God than the One 
who sat above the cherubim on the mercy seat. All 
prayers had to come to this place; just as in our time 
in the New Testament all our prayers have to come 
to Christ, who is our mercy seat, so that we should 
neither know nor worship nor call on any other God, 
except the one who dwells bodily in the man Jesus 
Christ. For there is none else either. 


V. 9 But those who rely on vanity in vain forsake 
mercy. 


29. the Hebrew says: They let their mercy go. But 

because this reads in German as if he speaks of the 
mercy of men, which they are to prove, | have omitted 
the little word "their", and have put "mercy" instead, 
so that it would be all the clearer. For Jonah speaks 
of God's mercy and goodness, which is ours, that is, 
offered, promised and set forth to us. Just as when | 
said of Christ, "Those who let their Christ, or their 
faith, or their gospel go,” 2c., when none of it is ours, 
but all of it is God's alone, who gives it; and yet it is 
called ours, because it is all offered and presented to 
us, that we should take it and have it for ours. 
30 For Jonah punishes with this verse the unwise 
saints of works and hypocrites, who do not trust in 
God's grace alone, but in their own works; the same 
because they 





They do not know what faith is, nor have they ever 
been in need of learning what faith is good for, and 
how even good works are of no avail; because they 
remain like this, they regard the graces as small, and 
they consider their own deeds to be excellent. But 
Jonah speaks here: It is vanity; that is in German: It 
is nothing and is good for nothing before God, before 
whom nothing is valid but his goodness and mercy, 
grasped and confessed with right faith, given to us 
without all work and merit. "Now those who rely on 
such vanity are in vain" (he says), that is, in vain and 
lost. For it is of no avail to them, that their trust or 
reliance is of as little avail as their doings or vanity, 
on which they rely. Hereby he especially touches his 
people Israel, who relied on the law and works, so 
that they not only abandoned the gospel or God's 
grace, but also persecuted it, when it should be theirs 
before all others, as it was promised to them. 


V. 10. But | will offer thanksgiving, | will pay my 
vows to the Lord,’ that | may be helped. 


(31) Again he touches the Jews with their 
sacrifices and works. As if he should say with the 50th 
Psalm, v. 13: "They sacrifice oxen and goats, as if 
God lusted for oxen's flesh and goat's blood", yet they 
think they have done well. But | hold that the sacrifice 
of thanksgiving is the right sacrifice before God, that 
one praises Him, extols Him and preaches about His 
goodness, which is done to us unworthy ones, as 
Jonah says here: "That | have been helped. But those 
rather want to be praised and preached by God, as 
1) those who have done great service and benefit to 
God with their works. Such knowledge of God's 
grace, although Jonah had it before, he did not have 
it as abundantly as he has now learned in this storm. 
For here he grasps that God does not consider any 
person nor merit who helps such unworthy sinners. 
Earlier Jonah was very deep in the fact that God also 
looks at the person, and 


1) Wittenberger: "more" instead of: rather; this change has arisen 
through misunderstanding. The meaning is: they rather want to be 
praised by God, as if they were such people, who with their works 2c. 


888 Erl. 41, 386-388. interpretation of Jonah (1.), Cap. 


2,10. 11. 3, 1. 2. W. VI, 2662-2665. 889 





The work, especially of the people of Israel, although 
it is not yet completely out. 

32 But that he says, "I will pay my vows," is not to 
be understood that Jonah has vowed something. For 
one does not read anything about it; so he does not 
indicate it among other thoughts he had in the whale, 
but only his prayer. Therefore we must be 
accustomed to the Scriptures, that where the dear 
saints speak in general of vows and payments, and 
do not express one in particular, that there the 
common vow of all who are God's people is 
understood. But there we vow that we will have no 
more God but Him alone. Therefore such "paying 
vows" means nothing else than confessing, praising 
and preaching, and thus honoring and serving the 
Lord; as the 50th Psalm, v. 14: "Offer to God the 
sacrifice of thanksgiving, and pay to the Most High 
your vows.” And Psalm 116:14: "I will pay my vows 
unto the LORD before all his people." So Jonah will 
also pay his vows, that is, praise and preach the Lord 
as his one God, because he has been helped. 


V.11. And the Lord spoke to the fish, and the fish 
spewed out Jonah onto the land. 
33) This is spoken in the right scriptural way, as that 
God does and makes all things by speaking or word, 
as John 1:3: "All things. 





Things are made by the word, and without the word 
nothing is made": and Ps. 33, 9.: "He speaks, so it is 
done; he gives, so it stands." So the fish did not have 
to digest Jonah, and the nature of the fish did not only 
have to keep still from its usual effect and swell, but 
also had to return the food, carry it to the land, and 
spit it out unharmed, so that God works great 
miracles on Jonah. There it is all reversed: what 
before served to death must serve to life; there the 
fish, which before was the jaws of death, must be the 
jaws of life, and Jonah must come to life through him, 
through whom he was caught and led to death. The 
sea must also give room and let his guest go to the 
land. Here the foundations of the mountains no 
longer hold: the bars of the earth are gone; the reeds 
no longer cover 2c. 

All this is our comfort and confidence, so that we 
may learn to trust God, with whom death and life are 
the same, and as easily as if He were playing with 
them, giving one thing and taking another, or 
changing one thing for another. But to us they are 
great, impossible things, in which he proves to us his 
power and art, as the 104th Psalm says.

The third chapter. 


V.1.2 And the word of the Lord came to Jonah the 

second time, saying, Arise, and go into the great city 
of Nineveh. 
This is written so that we may know how nothing can 
be done without God's word and command. For the 
first command of God was nullified by Jonah's 
disobedience. Therefore, if God had not commanded 
him anew, Jonah would not have known whether he 
should do it. Yes, it should have been well with him, 
as it was with the children of Israel, Num. 14, 1. ff. 
[Deut. 1, 41. 42.], who also did not want to fight for 
God's sake for the first time. 


They wanted to do it on their own and were beaten 
over it. Thus, what people do of their own choice and 
free will, without God's command and word, is 
nothing and vainly wrong. 


(2) In addition to this other command, it is added 
that he should preach what God commands him to 
preach, so that both the ministry and the ministry's 
word must be fasted by divine command; then it will 
also go right and bear fruit. Otherwise, if they walk 
without God's command, or preach otherwise than 
God's word, they do vain harm, as such things all do.

both which Jeremiah also teacheth, saying [Cap. 
23:21], They ran, and | sent them not: they preached, 
and | commanded them nothing." Let the two pieces 
be told thee that should preach, and mark them well; 
they are for thee and for the people, that thou mayest 
teach souls. Peter also wrote these two things: "If a 
man speak the word of God, and if a man minister 
the ministry, that he do it of God's ability," so that he 
might be sure that both word and ministry are divine 
and commanded by God. For it is decided: "He 
speaks, so it happens" [Ps. 33, 9], by His word all 
things shall happen, Joh. 1, 3. Therefore "all plants, 
which the Father does not plant, are cut down" 
[Matth. 15, 13]. For though they be planted, and 
though they spring up, they bear no fruit. Thus, man's 
deeds come to pass and do harm; but they do not 
end that which they would, but perish at last with their 
deeds, when they have done harm enough. 


V. 3. And Nineveh was a city of God, three days’ 
journey great. 


Why does he call Nineveh “a city of God"? Was 
there no worship, temple or prophets there? | think it 
is called so because God takes care of it and does 
not want to destroy it, but takes care of it and sends 
it a prophet to save it. Therefore, the city would have 
believed in the true God and Creator of heaven and 
earth. He also knew that they would hear his prophet, 
accept his word, and amend their ways. Just as the 
Scripture also says of Naaman of Syria that God 
helped the land of Syria through him [2 Kings 5:1], 
and also calls the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, 
his servant [Jer 25:9], so that he shows how he is 
also the God of the Gentiles, and not only the God of 
the Jews, but also has his own among the Gentiles. 
4 Some people understand that the city is three days' 
journey large, meaning that it has been surrounded 
by the ring so far that one could walk around it in 
three days. | will let them have their opinion, but it 
would have to be a small town that had twelve or 
fifteen German miles within the ring wall. For it would 
probably be five or six miles 


long and wide. So | understand that Nineveh was so 
large that in three days one could have walked 
through it in all its streets, not walking very far, but as 
one walks in the street at leisure. For afterward he 
saith, Jonah went in a day's journey, and preached, | 
respect it, that it was a place and a line, which a man 
might walk through in a day. The word mahalah, 
transitive, is helpful for this, that is, a walk, as one 
walks in the city now and then, just as Moses speaks, 
2 Mos. 11, 4. 5, that the Lord walked in the night in 
Egypt, and struck all the first birth, The same 
passage was not a straightforward passage, but a 
passing through now and then. Another one holds 
what he wants. 


V. 4 And he preached, saying, Yet forty days, and 
Nineveh shall be converted. 


5 Jonah went a day's journey and preached, but 
how many days he spent before he preached the 
place and the line is unknown. The sermon is also 
recently all-shown, what he had said, namely: 
"Nineveh will be converted over forty days." He 
undoubtedly not only spoke these words, but had to 
explain why such wrath of God came upon them, and 
what wickedness was in the city, and how one should 
be pious, and what belongs to it. Just as it is still done 
to summarize a sermon briefly, saying: He preached 
about sin, he preached about the mass. 


V. 5 Then the people of Nineveh believed, and 
preached to juice, and put on sackcloth, both great 
and small. 


(6) | think that there were saints in that city, so that 
Jonah called it "a city of God. For show me one more 
city in the wide world like unto it, though it be the holy 
city Jerusalem. For behold her: Jonah preached only 
one day's journey, and they did not all hear him, and 
yet they all converted. Jerusalem have never 1) 
neither Christ, nor all the

have deleted it, which all other editions except the Erlangen one have

893 





Apostles nor prophets, by their words and miracles, 
may bring it to this point, even if they have long dealt 
with it, and have preached through and through: that 
God also wants to say here, as Christ Matth. 8, 10. 
says of the centurion: "| have not found such faith in 
Israel". Yes, in Jonah's time Israel and Jerusalem 
were almost wicked, as Nineveh becomes pious. 

(7) Though Jerusalem had done the like in the 
days of David, Solomon, Ezekiel, Josiah, it was not 
such a wonder, because she had God's law, so many 
prophets, so many godly kings, princes, priests, and 
more noble men, who did and continued daily. But at 
the time of Jonah, Nineveh is the best and greatest 
city on earth, and has no equal. 

8) This place of the prophet Jonah the sophists 

use to draw on the works, and say: There, you see 
that God looks at the works, and the Ninevites 
thereby acquire grace, even though they are pagans 
and unbelievers; free will can well prepare itself for 
grace with works 2c. Here | answer: Jonah prevented 
such talk, since he first, before telling the works, 
praises the faith of the Ninevites, saying: "The people 
of Nineveh believed in God. They can skip such a 
saying and show us the works. Item, Jonah calls 
Nineveh "a city of GOD." To be a city of God and to 
believe in God does not mean that free will has done 
these works, but that God's grace and faith have 
done them, and for the sake of such grace and faith 
such works have pleased God. For they proved 
outwardly their faith and grace in their hearts, the fruit 
of Jonah's preaching. But what should not please 
God, where faith and grace are first in the heart, so 
that even the sins that remain do no harm? 
9 And notice that they do some things that God does 
not command them to do, and yet they tell Jonah, as 
fasting and putting on sackcloth. What does God ask 
about fasting and sackcloth? He wants to have the 
heart and the whole life changed; God did not 
demand it of them through Jonah, but only that they 
desist from their wickedness. Now one may well be 
in 





He says that they go in sacks and fast, and yet they 
are mischievous, as the monks are in their caps. For 
this reason he does not praise the fasting or the 
sacks afterwards, but "that they had converted (he 
says) from their evil ways. But they did this out of old 
habit, as they learned it from their forefathers, who 
thus humbled themselves before God with sacks and 
fasting. 

(10) The same is to be said of the king sitting down 
with his princes in the ashes, and doing such foolish 
things that even the animals and cattle should not eat 
or drink, and also putting on sacks and calling out to 
God. Who has ever heard that unreasonable animals 
should fast, put on sacks and cry out to God? Does 
God also ask for such things from animals? 

(11) Admittedly, God regards the fasting and 
sacking of animals as much as the fasting and 
sacking of men; and again, of men as much as of 
animals. But a fearful heart and a humble, frightened 
conscience does foolish things to prove that it is 
serious, and if it were possible, it would force stone 
and wood to mourn, and all creatures to weep with it, 
and still let itself think that it would not be enough. For 
it is unspeakable and incomprehensible what 
seriousness there is for a truly repentant heart, which 
thinks that it should be so bold to all the world, and 
do as it does; so that St. Paul says: the groaning of 
the spirit is inexpressible, Rom. 8, 26. And David 
Psalm 32:3 says: He roared like a lion with the 
groaning of his heart: that is, his repentance and 
groaning in his heart was so great and mighty that he 
burst out with howling and weeping as horribly as if 
one heard an angry lion roaring. When God sees 
such earnestness, He has had enough and is 
pleased with such foolish things, which He would not 
look upon if there were no such earnestness. That is 
why Jonah masterfully and powerfully cut out the 
repentance and penitence of the Ninevites, as they 
were fierce, serious and active. 

(12) Now if the sophists here want to praise the 
works that they do in the sight of God, we will not 
refuse them; but they sound that they also praise the 
earnestness out of which such works are done. For if 
they attribute the works alone to 


894 Erl. 41, 353-356. 


Interpretations On the Prophets. W. VI, 2671-2674. 


895 








To consider and accept thoughts without suc 

earnestness as the accepted sages are in 
monasteries and churches, especially in the week o 
fasting and martyrdom: they are truly foolish works, a 

if one were to make the animals fast, atone and pra 

without the repentance of men; so that on 

accomplishes nothing, except that one mocks Go 

and causes greater wrath. Therefore far, far from such 
works, or done with earnestness! But such 
earnestness is not given by free will or our power, bu 
by faith through the power of the Holy Spirit. 

(13) For we see here also that the Ninevites do no 
leave it at the foolish works, but over the fasting an 
crying of the beasts they attack the right things, an 
command, "Let every man turn from his wicked way, 
and from the iniquity of his hands. They want to prais 
the works and let them stand by what is written, 
namely, that one should become pious, so that the 
only offer chaff without grain, and the husks withou 
juice, the shells without kernel, and God is their foo} 
and mocking bird. Let them become pious beforehan 
and do the works that they praise, and then th 
quarrels will subside. But now they quarrel about goo 
works, which they do not intend to do, nor can they, 
yet they always want to talk about them and b 
masters of them. 

14) "To put on sackcloth" is spoken in Hebrew, tha 
it means to put on little clothes and to walk without an 
adornment, like those who wear suffering, and do no 
have to wear flour sacks or sackcloth as Jeremiah 
says Cap. 4:28: 1) "I will put sackcloth on th 
heavens," that is, make them dark and cloudy. And in 
Revelation, Cap. 6, 12, he says: "The sun ha 
become like sackcloth. So here the animals also pu 
on sackcloth, that is, they must mourn with it and se 
it sour; just as in the Hebrew way bread and wate 
means to eat and drink, and "to sit down in ashes' 
means to sit down, not to ride high and walk along in 
honor. Not that they should have needed bread an 
water, and sit in the ashes before the furnace or on 
the hearth, but because there is no less food than 
water and bread, 


1) Instead of this passage Is. 50, 3. should be cited. 


and no lesser garment than sackcloth, and no lesser 
place than ashes, is called with it all lowly food, 
garments and place; as Isaiah 2) says of Babylon 
Cap. 47, 1. "Down, Babylon, down, sit in the ashes." 


V. 9. Who knows, God wants to turn and repent 2c. 

(15) Then the king speaks as if he doubts and is 
not sure that God will be merciful, which faith 
demands, or is not faith. But he does not doubt, 
otherwise he would not have done so and would not 
have presented himself in this way. For doubting 
does not call to God, and does not suggest such 
earnestness. So it happens that a truly repentant 
heart is in battle with fear, and fights with despair, and 
has not yet won, therefore it speaks as if it were 
uncertain. But in truth it does not speak differently, as 
if it were not yet through, but is in labor and distress. 
Now if there were no faith, it would not be in such 
labor and trouble. Therefore these words are rather 
signs that faith is there, but such a faith that stands in 
fear and struggles, and yet has God's grace before 
its eyes, as it says here: "God would turn and repent" 
2c. That is, there is still goodness behind it, and not 
vain wrath. 

(16) It is not necessary to deal here with the 
pointed question of how God returns and repents, 
and makes him sorry, if he is unchangeable, so that 
some may grieve greatly and make it difficult for 
themselves. Rather, let us see what excellent faith 
was in the people who not only believed what Jonah 
preached about how the city would perish, but who 
also trusted in God's grace, even though they did not 
hear any promise from Jonah, but only the words of 
doom. 

The first part is great, that such a mighty city and 
king should so soon be terrified, and so highly fear 
God, and so deeply be humbled by a man's sermon, 
and not think why they should be sinners and 
damned above all other cities in the world. How stiffly 
Sodom stood

and Gomorrah against Lot! How Pharaoh held fast 
against Moses and Aaron! How stubborn Jerusalem 
remained against Christ and the apostles! How did 
Rome rage and rage against the Christians at all times! 
How defiant are princes and bishops against the gospel 
even now! Truly the whole world is like a jack, a devil 
against these people of Nineveh, and they are like 
angels against the world. 

18 The other thing is greater, that in such fear and 
anguish they should not despair, and yet have no 
promise. Rather, what do they hold on to that they do 
not despair? We have so many prophets, so many 
apostles, so much Scripture, so many books, preachers 
and comforting words, and yet we cannot trust God that 
our riches in God's Word would be called a sea 
compared to a drop that they have had. For they could 
have nothing more without the single word that God 
created heaven and earth, and that He is true God, that 
is, that He is kind and gracious. They make such little 
pieces so excellently useful to them for their salvation, 
and to both of us, Jews and Christians, to all disgrace, 
who cannot make half as much use of the abundance of 
God's word. For this reason Christ also imposes it on the 
Jews and all of us, saying: "The people of Nineveh will 
appear at the Last Judgment and condemn this 
generation, because they have atoned for their sins. 





Preach Jonah. And behold, here is more than Jonah." 
And this is not unreasonable, because we do not put 
forward half the earnestness, admonished with so many 
thousand prophecies and promises of God, since the 
Ninivites, terrified by One word of prophecy, comforted 
without some promise, prove so rich in faith. But it is like 
this: where there is little of God's word, there is great 
hunger and earnestness for it; where it is superfluous, 
one is weary of it and despises it. 


V. 10. Then God saw her works, so that she 
"turned" from her wicked ways 2c. 


Here, here the works are praised, what shall we say 
against it? The saints of works have won here. Yes, 
finely won! Look at the text. He says, "God saw their 
works," that is, they pleased Him well; but what were 
they? He interprets them himself, saying, "They taught 
themselves from their evil way." Do and teach such 
works, and we will not only grant thee the glory of works, 
but will help to praise them. "Turning from the evil way" 
is not a small work, it does not include fasting and 
sackcloth, but believing in God from the heart, and loving 
one's neighbor as oneself; that is, it requires the whole 
man to be pious and righteous, both inwardly and 
outwardly, in body and soul. For God demands the 
whole man, and does not like the half-breeds and 
hypocrites. 





The fourth chapter. 


V. 1. f. Jonah was almost very angry because of 
this, and he prayed to the Lord 2c. 

This is truly a strange saint to me, who is angry that 
God is merciful to sinners, and does not grant them any 
good, but vain misfortune, contrary to the kind of love 
that wishes and does all good even to enemies. And that 
is even more that he does this after he had experienced 
the great seriousness of divine will in the sea and 
whales. He still does not desist from this, since God 
punishes him for being unreasonably angry. And 


Yet he stands on such great faith that he asks God for 
death and does not want to live; which he could not ask 
if he had not trusted God most of all. 

What shall we say about this? How can such faith 
and such vice stand next to each other? Here one 
should ask, there would be benefit. We may not deny 
that Jonah is unreasonably angry and does wrong, 
because God punishes him for it, both in word and deed, 
and with a sign of the wild turnip. So we must also 
confess that he is in faith, and 


898 Erl. 41, 398-401. 
GOD has been pleasant, as far as GOD speaks so 
kindly to him and gives a sign, and poses like a man 
who speaks and acts kindly with his neighbor. 

(3) And if all these things were to be given to him, 
it is beyond measure that he should first approve and 
defend his first disobedience and flight, for which he 
is so horribly punished, and ascribe the guilt to God's 
goodness, since he says, "Oh, Lord, this is what | 
said while | was still in my country; therefore | also 
wanted to come beforehand to flee to the sea. What 
else is this said but this: | was right to flee and not to 
come here, and this is your goodness. Is there guilt? 
What does Jonah seek with it? Does he not defy 
God? Is he not striving to be cast again into a 
thousand seas and whales, as one who murmurs 
against God's goodness and justifies himself? If Saul 
or someone else did this, what would happen to him? 
If works should be valid or rewarded by God, Jonah 
would have to go into the abyss of hell, as he rages 
with his anger against faith and love. For he owes 
God's goodness, and forgives 1) his neighbor's 
mercy and all good. Are these good works? Yes, isn't 
there all unrighteousness, what is unrighteousness? 
| would not know what to answer here. 

The first thing is that we notice here how strange 
God is in His saints, so that no one may be careless 
to judge or condemn anyone for the sake of a work. 
The work may be evil, and is evil; yet | should not 
despise or condemn the persons. For if we look at 
Jonah here, his work is truly wrong, as God Himself 
punishes: nor is he the dear child, and speaks to God 
as freely as if he feared nothing from Him (as is true), 
and trusts Him as a father. 

The other is that we learn how God allows His 
dear children to err and fall short of good, great, and 
great things, as Christ also does with the apostles in 
the Gospel, for the comfort of all believers who 
sometimes sin and fall.

(6) The third, that we may see how kindly, fatherly 
and loving God acts and deals with those who trust 
in Him in trouble; how loving the Father becomes 
after the rod and distemper, as the epistle to the 
Hebrews says [Cap. 12:11]: that discipline brings 
forth the most lovely fruit to those who are exercised 
in it. For here you see, it does no harm at all, nor is it 
to be counted as sin, which is indeed sin and criminal, 
but is a daily childish sin, which the Father bears 
willingly and graciously. But he does not deal with the 
ungodly in this way; they also cannot get into it, but 
become completely too insolent and too wild, where 
they feel that God is merciful and sparing; just as if 
he should also allow or tolerate their ungodly nature. 

(7) But it is no wonder that Jonah does not want to 
grant God's grace to the Gentiles. For, you count, it 
was a constant belief among the Jews that Israel 
alone was God's people, as | also reported above, 
[Cap. 1, § 35 ff.], and all the Gentiles under God's 
wrath, as the [sixth] verse of Psalm 79 slurs: "O Lord, 
pour out your wrath on the Gentiles who do not know 
you, and on the kingdoms that do not call on your 
name." That is why they insisted that no man should 
be eligible for God's grace, he must first accept 
Mosiah's laws and become a Jew. For the apostles 
and the first Christians understood it no other way; as 
Lucas writes, that they went about preaching the 
gospel to no one but the Jews alone, and were angry 
with St. Peter because he had preached to the 
Gentiles. Apost. 10 and 11. 

008 And if Jonah be not persecuted of the Jews, 
or slain, because he preacheth unto the Gentiles in 
Nineveh, and calleth Nineveh a city of God, it shall be 
a great wonder. For it was offensive to the Jews that 
a people should be of God and not have and keep 
the Law of Moses, as the Ninevites of Jonah are 
praised here. What must those wait for who teach 
that they are Christians, and may be Christians, who 
neither have nor keep the law of the Pope and the 
Roman churches' way and commandment? All of 
them heretics, heretics, and burned. 

9. and would like to be that this is the 


900 en. 41, 401-403. interpretation of Jonah (1.), Cap. 4, 1. f. W. VI, 2682-2685. 


901 





right reason why Jonah did not want to go to Nineveh, 
and still grumbles that it should not perish, and would 
rather be dead, than that he should see someone get 
God's grace and become God's people without the 
law of Moses and the Jews' way. What is this but a 
disgrace to the people of Israel, as they have 
unnecessary and futile laws, so that without them 
men may be saved? Should they not say here: What 
do we do with so much toil and labor, if these last 
work only one hour and get the same reward with us, 
who carry the heat and burden of the day? as it is 
written in the Gospel [Matth. 20, 12]. Shouldn't this 
make eyes pale? Should they be no better? Should 
they get nothing more? 

(10) It is the same here, that the Ninevites get 
grace without law and prophets, and the Jews, with 
their great work in the law, get nothing more than they 
do; yes, even in the end they are completely lacking 
and lacking, because they want something better 
than the gospel with their murmuring and mocking, 
and do not want to grant the Gentiles to become 
Christians. This must have made Jonah quite 
unhappy, as he was the cause of all this with his 
preaching in Nineveh; and he was supposed to be 
the first to make Judaism contemptible and 
unnecessary? How could he have remained in the 
land? He did not flee without cause, refusing such 
preaching. For to be a Jew, and yet preach that 
Judaism is useless, and without which God's grace 
can be obtained, is just as much as if a Jew wanted 
to destroy his own Jews and make them useless, and 
elevate the Gentiles, just as St. Paul did in the same 
case, as Lucas describes in the Acts of the Apostles 
[Cap. 17, 24]. 

(11) Now that Jonah might be quieted, and might 
have answered his angry Jews, God played with him, 
and gave him a sign, as he did to Peter, Acts 10:11 
ff. 10, 11. ff., when he also stood in Jonah's presence, 
and gave him a vision from heaven, a linen cloth with 
all kinds of animals, and said to him: it would all be 
pure; when they were all heathens without the law of 
Moses 2c. So God gives Jonah a sign here, and 
made a wild turnip grow, so that Jonah had a merry 
litter on it. 





While he was rejoicing in such a hut, the Lord 
provided a worm early in the morning, which Jonah 
did not understand, which pricked the wild turnip so 
that it withered, and deprived good Jonah of his 1) 
desire. In addition he let the hot sun sting him on the 
head, because he had no more hut, so that he 
becomes once again reluctant, and beats one 
reluctance to the other, and wants to go nowhere, 
which he would like. Therefore, he asks for death 
once again, so that he can get rid of his listlessness. 

(12) Then God comes and quiets him, and 
concludes that he may do what he wills, as the father 
of the house says in the Gospel [Matt. 20:1 ff], 
proving also that Jonah is unreasonably angry. 
Behold, saith he, thou art wroth because of a little 
shrub, because it abideth not, but withereth: but how 
much less is such a shrub than a man, let alone such 
a city? Shouldest thou not also desire and gladly see 
that the city remain, to which thou wouldst so gladly 
see the wild turnip remain? What could Jonah say 
against this? He had to fall silent when he was 
overcome with his own judgment, into which he was 
finely led over the wild turnip before he looked 
around. So nothing is human wit against God. 

(13) The wild turnip, which in Hebrew is called a 
kik, and here a kikaion, that is, a kiklein or small kik, 
was well tried by the teachers of old. The elders 
called it a pumpkin. After that St. Jerome came and 


interpreted it as hedera, that is epheu, and said: it is 
not in the Latin country, but in Syria. But it is such a 
shrub, which grows very quickly, and soon becomes 
so large that it gives a hut and thick shade, has 
leaves like vines, therefore the ancients may have 
wanted to make it pumpkin. We consider it to be the 


shrub that the natural heralds call in Latin, vitis alba, 
which in German means: Wildertiben. Our priest, Mr. 
Johann Pommer, thinks it is called holy root in his 
Pomeranians, and grows so large that it reaches over 
a house, which resembles nightshade. For epheu, as 
Hieronymus makes it, it cannot well be, as he himself 
confesses, because the same

Bush does not stand on its stem, as Kikaion does, 
but hangs on walls and trees: that those have 
trophied much closer, who have interpreted it as 
pumpkin; although Jerome mocks them, and calls 
them pumpkiners. 

Now, there is not so great a power in it, and we 
should not quarrel so much about the words, if we 
are sure of the thing. It is true that this shrub, though 
it grows quickly by nature, was prepared here in one 
night, miraculously, for Jonah's sake, and Jonah sat 
under it for a long time, perhaps until the forty days 
were over. For the text says that he went out to the 
city, when he saw that they were converted, and sat 
down to see whether the city would perish. For he 
was already distressed when he saw them repenting, 
and he was afraid that they would not perish. But 
after forty days, when he saw that the appointed time 
was past, his anger rose up that nothing would come 
of his preaching; so he grumbled against God, and 
had to let himself be mastered, and so went home 
again with shame and humiliation, but with great fear 
and use of his mind. 

From all this we learn how God is a helper of all 
people, not only of the Jews, as St. Paul says, 1 Tim. 
2, 4: "God wants all people to recover and come to 
the knowledge of the truth. And that we Gentiles, who 
have come to the last hour and have not worked at 
all, come to God's grace unworthily, because it was 
not promised to us as it was to the Jews. God wanted 
us to be grateful and make use of the same, as these 
people did in Nineveh, so that we would not perish in 
the end through ingratitude, as happened to those in 
Nineveh afterwards. 

16 For this history of Jonah is written, that God 
may shew us his wonders, that his word may bear 
fruit first of all, when it is thought least of, and again, 
when it is thought least of, when it is thought most of. 
For here the Gentiles of Nineveh believe, who had no 
word before; and the Jews are disbelieving, who had 
the word of God daily; that we may not despair of any 
man, neither presume on any man. 





(17) He says here that Nineveh had more than an 
hundred and twenty thousand people, from which it 
can almost be inferred how large the city was. For 
because he names a hundred and twenty thousand, 
and some number more, he shows sufficiently that 
there were not a hundred and thirty thousand there; 
for otherwise he would have said more than thirty or 
forty thousand, or two hundred thousand. Now it is 
not yet beyond all measure a large city, since two 
hundred thousand humans are in it, particularly 
where it stands well, and goes in the swing, as here 
Nineveh stood as the royal city, the head in the 
emperorship to Assyria. It would be that one wanted 
to interpret it in such a way that the people, who did 
not know what was right or left, should have been as 
much as young children and fools; the old people, 
however, had been much more. But | do not hold 
such an interpretation, but that they all at once did not 
know what was right or wrong, that is, as we say, they 
knew neither this nor that in divine matters, when 
they had no law of Moses nor prophets to teach them 
how they should, both in spiritual and bodily, in 
outward and inward things, keep themselves before 
God, as the Jews had. For so the right hand may be 
pointed to the spiritual inwardly, and the left hand to 
the bodily, outwardly; for one must serve God with 
body and soul. That is enough of it. Now we must also 
deal with the spiritual interpretations, of which there 
are three: 

18. the first. Jonah is called a dove in Hebrew. 
Now in the New Testament the dove is the form of 
the Holy Spirit, Luc. 3, 22. and Joh. 1, 32. and 
especially the manifest Holy Spirit, who is given to 
preach Christ in all the world through the gospel; so 
that Jonah with his name is an example of the Holy 
Spirit and his ministry, namely the gospel, that all 
apostles and preachers should also be Jonah, and 
have the dove, that is, the Holy Spirit, and teach or 
do nothing of themselves without the Spirit; as also 
Christ himself Matth. 10, 16. commands his disciples 
to be without falsehood, like the doves, and cautious, 
like the serpents, that is, to teach the word of God 
purely and unadulteratedly, without any addition, 
simple as it is.

knows where, but only to the sea. For there is no sure 
nor certain conscience before God, but goes as the 
sea goes 2c. 

29 To these Jonah gives fare; for such teachers 
are belly servants, for money they teach and lead; 
they are also gladly given and made rich, as God 
gave the land of Canaan to the people of Israel, even 
for their works. But to the apostles and evangelists 
one gives nothing, but takes from them what they 
have. 

3t). Then Jonah enters the ship, and gives himself 
up to the teaching, lies down in the ship and snores, 
that is, he is safe, and thinks he is now well off, and 
always goes in the being. How then do all the saints 
of works, who in their glitter lie so deep down and 
sleep, and do not feel what evil they do, as Solomon 
says Ecclesiastes 4:17: "Obedience is better than the 
sacrifice of the wicked, who know not what evil they 
do." Behold, this means to go down to Japho and 
down into the ship; of course, high down from 
Jerusalem, from God's obedience into the depth of 
disobedience and conceit. 

31 But now God is coming to wake up the 
disobedient saint, and to make his holiness sin 
publicly, and to cause a weather to come, that is, to 
feel his wrath and judgment. 

(32) Then all their own holiness perishes, and 
both teacher and disciple despair, and the works will 
not endure nor stand, and the ship will break up and 
sink. 

Every man shall call upon his God, that is, to 
comfort himself with his good life. But no one hears or 
helps the idols, for they do not know the right God. 

34 Then they also awaken Jonah, that is, then 
they become true teachers of the law, then the law 
comes to its right office, and no longer teaches works 
nor false consciences, but shows sin and God's 
wrath, and frightens the conscience. 

35 This is when they loose, and seek sin, and 
meet Jonah. For the law does not cease to search 
and torture the conscience until it finds the sinner and 
forces him to confess; as David says Psalm 32:3: 
"Because | would keep it secret, my bones became 
obsolete" 2c. 





The loosening means that the sin is found about, and 
the law meets us; not when we think it, but when we 
think it least, then the house father comes, and finds 
us. Then Jonah must come out and confess to the 
law and justify how he is a sinner, otherwise the sea 
will not stop. 

(36) And even though they push and row hard to 
get to land, it does not help; that is, even though such 
a conscience is overcome, it still does not want to 
suffer the judgment of death, even though it 
confesses that it should and must suffer it, and that it 
deserves it. That is why Jonah does not jump into the 
sea himself, but is thrown in. 

37. at last they throw Jonah into the sea, because 
it will not be otherwise, but ask God not to impute it 
to them, and fear and serve God, that is, as St. Paul 
says Rom. 7, 10: "The law is good, pious and holy", 
and yet kills, and makes God angry with me; of which 
there is nothing more to be said now. 

38) Now that they fear and serve God means that 
the law, when it comes to its right office, serves God, 
that is, it makes fearful, humble servants of God, 
which before, when it was still in Japho, in abuse of 
works and conceit, it served the belly and took ferry 
money, and made snoring, safe, false works saints. 

39 Now here comes the whale and swallows 
Jonah, that is, death and hell. For this is how it goes 
in succession: first the law, then sin, and finally 
death; as St. Paul says in 1 Cor. 15:56: "The law is 
the power of sin, but death is the sting of sin"; that is, 
if there were no sin in the conscience, death could do 
nothing, neither pierce nor cut, neither choke nor 
torture, would have neither point nor edge, but would 
be blunt and nothing. But if sin is there, and is felt in 
the conscience, death soon has spear and sword, 
and wants to strangle the man badly; and also 
strangles him, if he is not helped. So also, where 
there is no law, that is, where there is no right law 
and in its right office, there would be no sin, that is, 
sin would not be felt, and sin would be powerless.

Interpretation of Jonah (1.), Cap. 4, 1. f. 


W. VI, 2693-2696. 909 





and do not bite, as it does, where the 1) Jonah sleeps in 
the ship, and the sure work saints. Just as it is in nature 
that where there is no law, there can be no sin; but when 
the law comes, sin is soon there, and feels itself in the 
conscience. As horrible as the whale with its mouth was 
to Jonah, so horrible is the threat of death in a sinful, 
frightened conscience. 

40 Then Jonah dies three days and nights in the whale, 
that is, the sinner lies in such terror and agony, and 
wrestles with death until he despairs. For within three 
days one can well feel whether one is dead, and 
whoever reaches the third day in death, there is no more 
hope. If he does not lie for a whole three days, that is, 
because he lies for a whole night and day, he is dead; 
for he may well reach one hour of the previous day and 
one hour of the following day. 2) Such three days are not 
long in this spiritual death. For it soon happens that 
death and fear drive him to despair. 

41 Then the living word of God, the gospel of grace, 
comes and speaks to the fish, that is, it barks at death to 
let man live. Then faith comes, and man is both delivered 
from sins and death, and so lives in grace and 
righteousness with Christ. 

Now Jonah learns to sing the little song Cap. 2, 10: "I will 
sacrifice with thanksgiving" 2c., and scolds those who 
rely on vanity and do not respect grace. For such people 
learn that works and the life of the law are vain things, 
and that only God's grace must help. And so they 
become people who create great benefit in the world. For 
they can teach, advise and govern rightly, because they 
have it not only from the books or words, but from the 
spirit and their own experience. There then cuts lind

is powerful what they teach, as Jonah means here with 
his sermon to Nineveh. 

(43) The third one Christ pointed out to Himself, 
Matth. 12, 39, 40, although it is not a whole allegory or 
interpretation, but an example. For Christ takes Jonah 
alone before him, as he was in the whale, and says that 
he will also lie dead in the earth, and calls it a sign of 
Jonah, that is, a sign that is like Jonah. For he does not 
make the three days spiritual, as is proper in spiritual 
interpretations; therefore it is more a similitude than an 
allegory; and no one should interpret it thus unless Christ 
himself had done it. Now, there is not much to be said 
about this here, because it is all known in the day and in 
all the world how Christ died and rose again, and that 
this is the miraculous sign given to the unbelieving Jews, 
yes, it is presented to all the world through the gospel, 
so that they may know how they are all redeemed 
through the same miraculous sign and the wonderful 
divine work, and that they should hold on to it with true 
faith. 

44 Now the whole world is offended at the sign, 
especially the Jews, and it is an offence and a 
foolishness to them; but it must nevertheless be, for they 
will have no other, as they would gladly have it. For there 
it is, as Christ says Matth. 12, 39: "No other sign will 
happen to this evil kind without the sign of Jonah the 
prophet. This is also said elsewhere. 

45 Finally, there is the wild turnip, with the worm that 
stings it at dawn. The story rhymes not only with Jonah's 
anger and thoughts, as the text reads, but also with 
Judaism, which has been a real wild turnip. 

46 First of all, it has large leaves, which is the best 
part, because Jonah has a fine shade and a hut under it 
against the heat of the sun. But nothing is reported there, 
nor is there any fruit. The leaves are the words and laws 
of God, as St. Paul says Rom. 3, 2: "God's words were 
trusted in them. 

47 Under these leaves sits Jonah, that is, the 
prophets and holy fathers sat under Judaism, as under a 
temporal tabernacle and outward worship, until 


910 


Erl. 41, 412-414. 


Interpretations on the Prophets. W. VI, 2896-2699. 


911 





on Christ. For it was a summerhouse or lauberhitte, 
which was temporal, and was to cease. 

(48) But it did not bear fruit. For the law without 
the spirit could not help anyone of itself, though many 
such holy people were among them in the spirit. 
Therefore Christ also cursed the fig tree with leaves 
without fruit, so that it withered away [Matth. 21, 19]. 
Which is one thing with this wild turnip. 

49 But Jonah rejoiced in this tabernacle, and 
waited for the destruction of the city of Nineveh. For 
it pleased the Jews, and they also boasted that they 
alone should have God's word and God's service, 
and they kept the Gentiles all lost, just as Jonah 
keeps the Ninevites here. 

50. While they were most confident that they 
alone were God's people, and like Jonah was most 
joyful over such a wild turnip, God provided a little 
worm that pricked the wild turnip, that is, Christ just 
came with his gospel, when the Jews were most 
proud that they were God's people alone, and pricked 
the wild turnip, that is, preached against it, and 
abolished the law by his Holy Spirit, and made us all 
free from the law and its power. 

51 Therefore Judaism is withered and destroyed 

until this day in all the world, and neither green nor 
flourishing anymore, nor saint nor prophet sitting 
under its shadow, it is over with them. For Christ is a 
worm, as he says, Ps. 22:7: "lam a worm, and not a 
man," because he is so miserably crucified and 
despised. But still the poor crucified worm bites such 
a fine bush that it withers, and with the small bite, that 
is, with the despised gospel, destroys such a 
kingdom and people. 
52) But the fact that the worm does not do harm in 
the evening, but early in the morning, when the dawn 
breaks, means that such a worm does not do harm in 
the evening, but early in the morning, when the dawn 
breaks. 


The fall of Judaism happened when the time of grace, 
the New Testament, went out through the gospel to 
all the world. For he that caused the wild turnip to 
grow miraculously, the same also caused it to be 
pierced by the worm, and to wither. Thus, Judaism 
also arose quickly through great and many 
miraculous deeds, by the power of God, not by their 
own strength or power; as the histories show in the 
times of Moses and all kings 2c. In the same way it 
withered and perished, by God's will and command, 
when the hour of the gospel came. 

53. Now Jonah grumbles for two great reasons: 
one, that the wild turnip withers and he can no longer 
sit under its shade; the other, that Nineveh should not 
perish; that is, it was ever unreasonable, even in the 
sight of some great saints, that the Jews should be 
abandoned and wither and perish, and the Ninevites, 
the Gentiles, should accept the gospel and become 
God's people: Then the sun stingeth hotly upon 
Jonah's head, and cometh a dry east wind, that he 
should faint. For St. Paul, too, Rom. 9:3, was greatly 
distressed that the Jews were so corrupt, and would 
gladly be banished from Christ for their sake. 

54 But he is told that it is cheaper to be angry that 
Nineveh should perish than that the wild turnip should 
wither, and cheaper that Nineveh should remain than 
the wild turnip; that is, as St. Paul Rom. 11:11. From 
the destruction of the Jews comes the salvation of the 
Gentiles; that is, it is better and cheaper for Judaism 
to perish (which was of no use without the Spirit, and 
was vain leaves without fruit), than for the whole 
world to perish through its continuance. The 
judgment pleased God, and is also right, that we 
Gentiles may well give thanks to His grace. For the 
Jews, if they would also believe and leave Judaism, 
no harm would come to them, and yet all our 
salvation would be in it. God help us to do this, amen.

Paul Rom. 3, 29. says: "Is God the God of the Jews 
alone? Is he not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, 
indeed, also the God of the Gentiles." For this history 
shows that God also took care of this godless 
kingdom of the Assyrians, even though they were 
Gentiles and uncircumcised, and not of the Israelite 
people that God had chosen, even though they 
persecuted Israel. Thus he always had his Christians 
in the midst of the whole world together with the Jews, 
while meanwhile the Jews did not see this, but even 
despised all other peoples in comparison with 
themselves, because they did not have the law. Thus, 
even today, there are undoubtedly many Christians 
all over the world who are completely unknown to the 
world, whom God has chosen. Therefore, in this 
history we are taught how great the power, strength 
and effectiveness of the Word of God is, how it cannot 
be preached in vain, that it should not bear fruit, and 
that obviously. And if we now estimate this history in 
such a way according to the power and efficacy of the 
Word, it is certainly extraordinarily admirable and full 
of consolation, even though it otherwise seems to be 
small in outward appearance. Is it not a great power 
of this sermon, which within three or four days 
converted that exceedingly powerful kingdom, that it 
threw both the king and all the inhabitants into 
sackcloth and ashes, because they repented of the 
sin revealed to them by the word? 

Now although this history is clear and easy and full of 
consolation, it has been obscured by insoluble and 
innumerable and void questions of the holy fathers, 
which may be seen in the interpretations of all. We do 
not want to deny that the Fathers were holy, but none 
of them was without this carnal attitude, which is 
certainly very evil, namely that they judged the saints 
according to their person and outward works, holding 
the opinion that there is nothing human or human 
movements in the saints, without which, as long as 
this mortal flesh lasts, even the most holy cannot be, 
which can be seen everywhere in Scripture, but most 
clearly in the seventh chapter of the letter to the 
Romans. Therefore this is for Jerome 


and all the others have been the cause that, as often 
elsewhere because of many passages of Scripture, 
so also in this prophet, they have been extraordinarily 
troubled with many and various questions, since they 
dispute whether Jonah sinned in that he commanded 
that he should be thrown into the sea, or not? and 
how it is possible that he does not sin who freely 
inflicts death on himself? Jerome answers that this is 
permitted if chastity is in danger 2c. This is certainly 
a great abomination and an absolutely sacrilegious 
judgment, from which all must beware as from an 
exceedingly dangerous poison. St. Augustine's 
treated the matter more correctly and cautiously. 
Summa Summarum, all of them, as many as have 
been, have not paid attention to the kingdom of grace 
through Christ, nor have they understood it precisely 
and thoroughly, although they want to be considered 
as having paid attention to it and understood it. By 
God's grace, we have certainly been given greater 
light and a more accurate judgment of the kingdom of 
grace than all of them. We cannot err at all if we stand 
by the word and follow the judgment of the Word of 
God, namely, since we look at the faith in the works 
of the saints, not at the work itself, since the works 
can deceive, no matter how seemingly they may be, 
but not faith in the same way. Therefore, the Scripture 
calls killing good in the case of some kings, and 
condemns it in the case of others, since the latter 
killed by faith, following the word of God and pleasing 
God, while the latter did it without faith and sinned, 
while looking at the work of both, it seems as if evil 
was done on both sides. 

The kingdom of grace is a kingdom of favor, in 
which God is favorable to the Christians who are in 
this kingdom. In the meantime, the saints in this 
kingdom sometimes stray and have carnal minds, 
which we see everywhere in the writings of Paul, who 
wants Christians to bear one another's burdens, to 
strengthen one another, to restore those who have 
fallen. In general, we who are still alive must not be 
separated from the saints, as if those who were alive 
in the flesh were not to be separated from the saints. 


916 L. XXVI, 49 f. Interpretation of Jonah (2.), Cap. 1, 2.3. 


The people of the world said that something higher had 
happened to them than to us, since they all have the 
same flesh. These people could not see that. The author 
of the Epistle of James rightly says in the last chapter: 
"Elijah was a man like us. All have the same spirit, the 
same faith, the same Christ, and if we feel in ourselves 
the weakness of the flesh, if at times we fall, let us 
remember that they also may have fallen. Therefore, to 
return at last to Jonah, if we cannot save Jonah by this 
reason, that he, full of faith, did this work, it is quite 
certain that he, empty of faith, sinned, and we shall not 
be able to deny that he did a very great sin, namely, in 
setting aside the command of God by which he was 
sent, as the following indicates. Here all may continue 
with all their glosses that he was frightened by the 
godlessness of the kingdom of the Assyrians [, he 
feared] that they would not believe the word. With these 
glosses they want to diminish that great sin, but we want 
to make it great for our comfort. But because he was a 
child of grace, this sin was forgiven him, as great as it 
was, otherwise he would have perished, as Saul 
perished, because he did not kill Agag, the king of 
Amalek, over whose killing he had God's command, as 
Jonah did here. 





917 


had the command of God to go to Nineveh and preach. 
This history is certainly lovely and admirable that Jonah 
was able to persevere in faith, since his conscience was 
so terrified. For he was aware of the great sin, because 
he felt the wrath of God and equally also the 
punishment, 1) namely, of sin, as he also says below 
[Cap. 2, 2.) says: "I cried out from the belly of hell" 2c. 
All this is written for our consolation, that although we 
feel both sin and the punishment of sin, we should 
nevertheless persevere and not despair, however great 
the punishment and chastening of God may be, so that, 
finally saved (as we must be saved if we patiently suffer 
the hand of the Lord), we may speak with David, Ps. 
117, 18: "The Lord chasteneth me, but giveth me not 
unto death." Therefore, although those who are in the 
kingdom of Christ sin, they are not condemned, since it 
is a kingdom of grace; sin is forgiven and not imputed 
for Christ's sake 2c. This summa or main part of the 
kingdom of Christ all holy writers have not been able to 
understand, all have lacked this judgment. This | know 
for certain, having searched all their writings 2c.

V.2.3 Arise, and go into the great city of Nineveh, 
and preach therein: for their wickedness is come up 
before me. But Jonah arose, and fled before the Lord, 
and would have gone to the sea, and came down to 
Japho. And when he found a ship going to sea, he 
gave ferry money, and stood three, that he might go 
with them to sea before the LORD.) 


"Jonah arose, and flee." No doubt he was frightened 
by the magnitude of the task to which he was sent, and 


was afraid of such a powerful kingdom, of such powerful 
princes, just as if someone would be sent to the kingdom 
of the Turks today. And this greatness of the task the 
Lord increases, since he says: "Their wickedness has 
come up before me." Therefore, by this sermon, since 
he declared all these princes guilty of ungodliness, he 
would have aroused the bitterest hatred of all against 
him, while he was a single and lowly man. But in this he 
sinned, as | said, since he did not look at the word of 
God.

921 





The greatness of the task, out of pusillanimity, to 
carry out the command of the Lord. This is a serious 
matter, a great sin, just as the punishment of sin was 
great. Besides being outwardly terrified by the Lord's 
wrath, he also felt the wrath of God in his conscience. 
But he remained in faith, however much greater a 
storm raged in Jonah's heart or conscience inwardly 
than outwardly on the sea 2c. Because we are only 
spectators of such terrifying events, they do not 
appear to us as great and terrible as they are. But if 
we were to experience this ourselves in our 
consciences, then we would realize what it means to 
feel God's wrath against us, and what faith fei, which 
even in the midst of wrath grasps God as a merciful 
and gracious one 2c. If this were to happen, we 
would leave many useless questions unanswered, 
with which we otherwise struggle miserably in such 
passages of Scripture when we are out of challenge. 


V. 5. [And the shipmen were afraid 2c.] 

This thunderstorm on the sea was much greater 
than what usually happened. For even the shipmen 
were so terrified that they attributed it to someone's 
sin. Therefore Jonah, aware of this evil, hid himself 
in the lowest part of the ship, since he felt nowhere 
safe in his conscience and the fear of the wrath of 
God had seized him, and slept. 1) This sleep was 
entirely a sleep of sorrow, with a certain sensation of 
death mixed in, which is known to those who have 
once suffered such afflictions. And the Hebrew word 
that is written here also expresses the same thing in 
a subtle way. All this is written so that we may see 
how Jonah felt the presence of divine wrath, and how 
great a thing the trembling of consciences is when 
they are terrified by the wrath of God. Then, when the 
Lord is angry, the mountains are touched and smoke, 
as the Psalm [104:32] says. 

"And the shipmen were afraid, and cried every 
man unto his God." The 


1) dormit is highlighted as a new keyword in the editions, but the 
verse number "5." is found only before the following paragraph. 





Shipmen were not entirely atheists, because they call 
God, but the one they form themselves. For to have 
gods is to form them in one's heart. And therein lies 
the main thing that one thinks of God as right or good. 
For God is such toward us as we ourselves believe 
Him to be toward us, and form Him in our hearts, as 
it says in the 18th Psalm, v. 26 f.: "With the holy you 
are holy, and with the pious you are pious, and with 
the pure you are pure, and with the perverse you are 
perverse." And this keeping of God is followed by the 
various worship services of different people. As each 
one forms God, so he worships Him. The divine 
majesty is subject to the various opinions of men; 
some judge God in one way, others in another, as 
can be seen in Matth. 16, 14: "Some say that you are 
John the Baptist, others that you are Elijah, some that 
you are Jeremiah, or one of the prophets" 2c. The 
same we see here with the shipmen: they called the 
true God by name, but in what form or in what 
opinion, that is not known. This alone is the right form 
of God, when we take hold of Him in faith, namely, 
that we recognize that God is always a gracious 
Father and a Father of mercy. This knowledge alone 
is from the Holy Spirit, and this alone is the true and 
right one. All others are idolatrous, for we invent 
some works for ourselves by taking our reason as our 
guide and teacher, through which we think we can 
become pleasing to God and gain reward or favor for 
his sake. That is absolutely idolatry, if we impute this 
figure of our performed works or our inventions to 
God. This alone is the root and source of all idolatry. 
Such are all the monks, nuns, missals, and all those 
who judge God by the works they have invented. 
God, however, does not want to be shaped by us in 
this way, but wants to shape us. He wants us to 
believe in Him absolutely, namely, that we please 
Him not by any work, by anything we do, but because 
He has mercy on us. This means to be born again of 
the Holy Spirit, as it is written in John Cap. 3 is 
written.

V. 6 Then the master of the ship came to him and 
said to him, "Why are you sleeping? Get up, call upon 
your God. 


This is an excellent passage, and worth noting. 
When human nature is out of danger and all is well, it 
is hopeful, tranquil and secure, and promises itself 
many things, but in adversity, when it sees that it is 
done for, it submits to all, even to the very lowest. So 
here; since the shipmen are in despair and danger of 
death, they seek everywhere they can. They take 
refuge in Jonah, whom they would not have cared 
about in the least except for the challenge. This is the 
nature of human reason, and it cannot act differently 
in the face of adversity. In the past, when we were 
oppressed by sin in our conscience, we ran to the 
monks or | don't know what other people for comfort. 
So here the shipmen take refuge in Jonah. For reason 
thinks that it must be saved through the intercession 
of another, but faith, as it despises no one, so it trusts 
in no one, but only in God, whom it calls upon in 
distress 2c. 


V. 7. 8. 1) And one said to the other: Come, let us 
loose. 


As in many other places, the papal decrees on 
casting lots have struggled miserably with this point. 
Casting lots to tempt God is evil, but the need and 
danger of death in such a case does not tempt God, 
unless someone is obviously godless. 2) Thus the 
LORD has promised to give us a living and everything 
that serves as a living, but in such a way that we 
should not sit idly by and misuse our hands, which 
are given to us by God to work. Therefore, if your 
hand is strong, and you do not have a manifest word 
of God like Elijah, who was fed from heaven, yet 
hope. 


1) The verse numbers "7th" and "8th" are missing in our template. 
2) How this is to be understood, see Luther's previous interpretation 
of the prophet Jonah, Cap. 1, 7. 





that what is necessary for your livelihood may be 
granted to you, 3) then you are tempting God. But in 
adversity, when you are trapped, where you have no 
opportunity either to work or to earn a living, and then 
expect your livelihood from heaven, that is indeed not 
tempting God. So here, too, one must definitely judge 
the casting of lots. They were urged by the greatest 
need and could not do otherwise; Jonah, however, 
although he was aware of such a great misdeed, 
nevertheless cast the lot with them, hoping that he 
would be able to escape in some way. But our unruly 
interpreters, who judge the saints in such a way only 
according to their works, know nothing of faith, 
nothing of spiritual temptations, otherwise they would 
judge more intelligently, which | have explained quite 
abundantly at the beginning of this prophet. A work 
done at different times by different people does not 
count equally before God, but the works must be 
judged according to faith. This is the reason why God 
approves of a work in one person and disapproves of 
it in another. But | do not absolve Jonah from sin 
here. 


V. 9. He said to them: | am a Hebrew, and | fear the 
LORD GOD from heaven 2c. 


Here finally begins the confession of sin. He says 
that he fears God from heaven, who is angry with him 
and from whom he has foolishly taken it into his mind 
to flee. But he speaks according to the Hebrew way 
when he says that he fears God. Fear of God is 
reverence and spiritual worship, for this is how 
Scripture uses the word fear of God everywhere. For 
the right proper service of God does not consist in 
works, however great and holy they may be, but in 
true and right reverence. Such a way of speaking is 
in the Psalm [Ps. 19, 10]: "The fear of the Lord is pure 
and abides forever" 2c. There, the fear of God is 
divided into various parts, but all this does not serve 
the purpose, since he speaks of the fear of the Lord 
in the passage. 


3) Instead of our template 
to be read. The Erlangen offers: 


924 L. xxvi, 57-59. interpretation of Jonah (2.), Cap. I, 10-14. 


God, just as he also speaks of the law of the Lord. 
Therefore, it is the opinion of Jonah when he says: "I 
fear God from heaven", that is, | am a true 
worshipper of the true God. Thus Jonah feels the 
wrath of God within himself and now also the 
punishment, which becomes even greater, since now 
also the sin has been revealed and made public. 


V. 11: For the sea was boisterous. 


That is, the sea did not stop roaring, but the storm 
grew bigger and bigger. And so, since the Lord did 
not calm the storm, Jonah wanted to remedy this evil 
by his death. This was certainly a great sin in the 
prophet. Moreover, by far the greatest and most 
frightening thing is that now that he was about to die, 
he knew for certain that he had an angry God who 
was against him, and that therefore he would have to 
die by the wrath of God. This was a very bitter 
challenge: that he thus saw death before his eyes, 
yes, now wanted to die, and yet knew that God was 
angry with him. We do not consider this greatness of 
the challenge, since in the meantime we only look at 
the fact that he was miraculously preserved 
afterwards, since God wanted it that way. But in all 
these so terrifying temptations, he was a forerunner. 


925 


image of Christ, since Christ Himself interprets it as 
we will say. 

In addition, although Jonah alone was the cause 
of this storm, all those who were with him were also 
in danger of their lives in the same way and suffered 
the same punishment. This is what we have often 
said, that because of an ungodly man a whole 
country and a whole people often perish and are 
miserably afflicted. The Scriptures are full of such 
examples. For example, the Lord miserably afflicted 
the entire Israelite nation for the sake of Achan, who 
had stolen the banished people, Jos. 7. In contrast, 
the One Moses was often a salvation for all of Israel. 
Thus the author says in the last chapter of the epistle 
Jacobi [v. 17.]: "Elias was a man like unto us, and he 
prayed a prayer that it should not rain, and it rained 
not on the earth three years and six months." These 
are God's judgments, who does not act unjustly, 
however much it may seem otherwise to us. 


V. 14. O Lord, let us not perish for the sake of this 
Maune's soul. 

This terror of death was salutary to them, for they 
were converted to the true God 2c. 


The second chapter. 


So that the terror of death would be even greater, 
Jonah is not only thrown into the sea, where there 
was nothing from which he could have hoped for 
help, be it from God or from men, since he now 
thought that he would have to die, but is also 
swallowed alive by the fish, since the Lord provided 
the fish in such a way, so that he would still be alive 
in the midst of death. An extraordinarily wonderful 
history, by which the dear God wanted just that, that 
we would be completely sure that he is the Lord of 
death and of life, that everything is in his hand. For it 
is he who kills and makes alive, makes alive and kills, 
leads into hell and out again [1 Sam. 





2, 6.]. Therefore, we are to learn that we have such 
a God who can preserve us even in the midst of 
death, in the midst of sin and hell, but in the same 
way as He miraculously preserved His Jonah here, 
who saw nothing else, nor could hope for anything, 
but death. For this was certainly something 
frightening for Jonah, that he, now being thrown into 
the sea to perish by the water, felt another devourer, 
who swallowed him up with his tremendously large 
maw. And now that he had been swallowed up, he 
nevertheless did not perish, but remained alive for 
three days. No doubt there was an extraordinary 
struggle of faith in Jonah, since he could not die like 
that, kept alive in the belly of the fish. He

felt the divine grace, namely since he did not die; he 
felt that he was blameless, which his song indicates, 
and that God was present, since he was not 
consumed, and yet he was still doubtful in his heart; 
it might happen that he should still be consumed. This 
was certainly an extraordinary and severe challenge, 
that hardly any other seems to me more admirable, 
and if the Holy Spirit had not written such things, | 
would not easily believe it. But, as | have said, it was 
all written for our sake, so that we might learn from it 
to trust in the kind Father, the dear GOD, in all 
adversity. For why should we not trust in God, why 
should we not rely on Him in all adversity, when He 
sustains His own in the midst of death, in the midst of 
hell, and has promised that He will sustain them, to 
such an extent that even death, sin, hell and all evils 
must serve the good of the godly, and not only not 
harm them, but also become salutary and 
serviceable for life, which can be seen quite clearly in 
this story of Jonah. "Whosoever therefore will not 
trust in GOD, let him trust in the devil." So completely 
true is what the apostle Paul says [Rom. 8, 28/ that 
all things serve believers for the best. 


V. 1. And Jonah was in the body of the fish three 
days and three nights. 

It is marvelous how he could have counted the 
days, since he neither saw nor heard anything, when 
he was closed in the body of the fish. But he 
remembered the day when he was thrown into the 
sea and the day when he was finally brought to light 
again. And without doubt he was not three whole 
days and nights in the fish, as also Christ did not lie 
three whole days in the grave, if one wants to make 
a completely exact calculation. But the scripture uses 
the figure of the synecdoche, namely by taking a part 
for the whole 2c. 


. 2. And Jonah prayed to the Lord his God in the 
body of the fish. 


It does not take place that you think that the prophet 
has worked out this his song in such a way. 





while he was in trouble, but that only after he was 
freed did he put in order what he had thought in the 
adversity and challenge. But it is a fine song and a 
clear testimony against trusting in works. For he says 
thus: 


V. 3. | cried out to the Lord in my anguish. 


For in distress of body and soul there is nothing 
left but to cry out. Our efforts and our strength are 
nothing, as Jonah cried out when he was pressed by 
need. There was no merit, for he had sinned 
exceedingly grievously against the Lord. Therefore, 
the only thing that remained was that he cried out, 
and that was "to the Lord". For it is he alone to whom 
we must flee as a holy anchor and the only refuge 
when we think that it is all over for us. But this is the 
highest thing, that even though we feel that God is 
against us, and we have an angry God, and we are 
sinners who deserve wrath and condemnation, we 
can still call upon God as a kind and forgiving Father, 
1) as He always is and never has to be taken 
otherwise. And so God is to be judged, not by what 
we see, but by His promises, by which He has 
promised to be our Father and our God. Thus, if he 
is kind to us, if he does not look at us or strike us, we 
should not trust him [for this reason], since he acts 
differently from what is before our eyes, but should 
stand in fear. On the other hand, if he strikes us, we 
must again not mistrust him, 2) not despair, because 
he acts differently than we think. 


And he answered me. 


He felt that his prayer was powerful, just as the 
effectiveness of a right prayer must be felt. For if we 
do not feel that our prayer has been powerful, we 
have not prayed rightly. Inevitably, the following 
follows

929 





true prayer feels this inward sensation, just as the 
preachers of the Word feel the efficacy of the Word they 
teach. For Christ says Luc. 8, 46: "| feel that a power has 
gone out of me." 


| screamed from the belly of hell. 


Thus he adapts the speech to the movements of the 
heart, since it could not be otherwise to his mind than 
that he would be kept in hell, as also the Scripture calls 
such severe temptations hell, as one can see 
everywhere in the Psalms, and says that those who are 
in the utmost temptation are in hell 2c. 


And you heard my voice. 


That is, even though there was nothing but ruin and 
condemnation before the eyes, even though faith had to 
struggle, it still persevered, and therefore | have been 
preserved, you have heard me. For faith is preserved by 
the word, even though there is nothing but condemnation 
before the eyes, however great the trials may be. 

V. 4. You threw me. 


Now he describes almost to the end his sinking [into 
the sea]. 


Into the depths in the middle of the sea. 


In eoras maris is a Hebrew expression, that is, to the 
bottom of the sea. This is a frequent expression in the 
Scriptures, as, in the fifth book of Moses [Cap. 4, 11.]: 


usque ad cor caeli, that is, "to the midst of heaven”. And 
Ps. 45, 6: "That the nations fall down before thee” in 
corda inimicorum regis, that is, "in the midst of the 
king's enemies," where they are strongest and most 


numerous. So also here: in corde maris, that is, where 
the sea is deepest. 


All your waves and billows went over me. 


This is also taken from the Psalm. By the way, instead 
of gurgites, which we read [in the Vulgate], one should 
translate more correctly fracturae. For the same word is 


in the 93rd Psalm, v. 4: "The waves of water (elationes) 
in the sea are great," where the ancient writers 


translated: SUSpensurae. But it actually means- 


The first thing is what we Germans call "bulges or 
waves". It is therefore the opinion: All thunderstorm and 
all impetuosity of the sea covered me. But he expressly 
says "yours", that is, my conscience testifies to me that 
it is you who inflict this punishment, this terror of death 
and hell. And this is the punishment of consciences, that 
we feel the wrath of God against us in adversities, who 
lays out for us these evils and these exceedingly great 
plagues. 


V. 5: That | thought | was cast out of your sight. 


Here he meant that it had happened to him body and 
soul, as if he wanted to say: All this drove me to despair; 
frightened by these signs, | saw nothing else than that it 
had happened to me, that | was rejected by you. This is 
one of the inexpressible groans, this is the highest groan 
and the highest death in temptation. These are not vain 
words, and only those understand them who have once 
suffered in this piece. They know what it means that the 
conscience feels within itself that it has in truth been 
rejected by God. For this is how it seems to such 
consciences 1) that are in distress, as it also seemed to 
Jonah. For he says, "I thought," as if to say, "| was 
wrong, and you were wrong, since you acted differently 
from what | expected to happen. So in the heart of Jonah 
there was a struggle with despair, but he did not despair 
completely. For in such temptations despair is so great 
and so mighty that even faith seems to succumb, but still 
it endures, and God's power is mighty in the weak, 2 Cor. 
12:9. The same is in all the pieces in the 31st Psalm, 
from which this is taken [v. 23.], "| said in my trembling," 
it says, "Il am cast out of thy sight." 


| would not see your holy temple again. 


| am entirely of the opinion that [what is affirmatively 
stated in the Vulgate is] ver-.

noing must be understood and read, so that the 
opinion is: Do you also think that | will ever see your 
holy temple? For even to this day the Hebrews do not 
agree about this word that is written here. It may 
mean the outward temple at Jerusalem, for that was 
appointed by GOD for prayer. Or, to whom this does 
not please, he may understand the spiritual temple, 
that is, where GOD dwells, as the prophets use to 
nine the dwelling place of GOD the temple of GOD 
2c. 


V. 6. reeds (pelagus) covered my head. 


The Hebrew word here means either the sea or 
reeds. Therefore | translate in such a way: Reeds 
had my head entwined, that is, the sea, which has 
reeds or rushes at the shores, has become a crown 
of my head. So much was lacking in it that | could 
have escaped. So he highlights the challenge and 
makes it great. 


V. 7. | sank down to the mountains’ foundations. 


To the foot of the mountains, where the mountains 
have their end, that is, | was at the bottom of the sea. 


The earth had locked me eternally. 


These are all figurative speeches, as if he wanted 
to say: It was impossible that | could have gone out, 
because the earth had completely closed me with 
bars, as it were; nothing could be hoped for that | 
would be freed. And this is a great movement of the 
heart. For this is the way to sinue to all who are in 
such heavy temptations that they do not think it can 
happen in any way that they will be redeemed. 


But you have led my life out of ruin. 
The Hebrew word which the Latin interpreter 


translated by perditionem, 1) is also found in the 16th 
Psalm where we read [Vulg. 


1) This is not correct, but also here is in the Vulgate: 6k 
eorruptiorik. The opinion of Luther will be: instead of enrruptionk 
should be set pkraitionk. This is also offered by the Zwickau 
manuscript. 





V. 10.]: "You will not admit that your saint sees 


corruption (corruptionem)." This word was by all 
means a word of faith, and if this be said of nus in 
truth, it is impossible that we should perish, though 
we be in the midst of death and hell. And here he 
prescribes to us the way in which we are to be 
snatched out of the resurrection, as if to say, If any 
man be afflicted, if he feel the terror of death, and be 
in hell, call upon the Lord, as | also have called upon 
ihu. Remember the Lord, call upon him with 
confidence, and when he has been called upon, he 
will help you immediately. Here belong many psalms. 


V. 8. Since my soul despaired with me. 


This is also taken from the 42nd Psalm, v. 12: 
"Why do you grieve, my soul, and are so troubled 
within me" 2c. 


V. 9: Those who hold above the void. 


This is what the spirit does immediately, that he, 
instructed by his experience, teaches others the 
same, and condemns everything, whatever it may 
be, in which we trust outside of our uprightness. This 
is the only and quite right service of God, when in 
adversity we take refuge in him as a father to obtain 
help. All our works, undertakings and all the efforts 
with which we want to help ourselves are null and 
void, they cannot help us; in adversity everything falls 
away, because it is something null and void, as 
Jonah calls it here, and not only that, but they are 
also null and void people, because they hold above 
the null and void and take care of it, i-e., what they 
take care of or worry about is null and void, and their 
works, with which they struggle so vainly, are null and 
void. 


Abandon their grace. 


That is, the grace of God, in which they should 
hope for everything. For the grace of God is ours, 
since we are to hope in it alone, and are preserved 
by it alone in all adversities. Everything else, by 
which we want to help ourselves, is null and void. 


932 L. XxvI, 65-67. interpretation of Jonah (2.), Cap. 2, 9-11. 3, 3. 


933 





Thus we learn to keep the grace of God in no other way 
than in temptation, when we think that it is all over for us, 
when not only God but also all creatures seem to be 
against us, when we cannot remedy the evil with our 
advice, with our wisdom, reason and all our efforts. 


V. 10. But | will sacrifice with thanksgiving. 


This is the sacrifice of the godly, this alone does the 
Lord require of them, these are the farrows of the lips, 
that is, thanksgiving. See the whole 50th Psalm. [There 
itis said, v. 14: "Offer thanksgiving to God," likewise (v. 
23.): "He who offers thanksgiving praises me," namely, 
if we ascribe everything to God, nothing to ourselves 2c. 





| will pay my vows to the Lord. 

"Pay vows" is everywhere in the Psalms for giving 
thanks. For it is "to pay the vow" to confess and praise 
that the Lord alone is our God, who alone can and will 
snatch us out of all temptation and adversity, and it is 
done for us if he does not save us 2c. 


V. 11. The fish fed Jonah from the land. 


Thus, for the godly, death and sin are the cause of life 
and righteousness, and disgrace is the cause of honor: 
in fact, everything must serve them for the best, as we 
said at the beginning of this chapter. What, therefore, 
can separate us from the love of God? Hunger or 
persecution 2c.? Rom. 8, 35. 


The third chapter. 


We have said enough and too much about the 
greatness of Jonah's task in the first chapter. 


V. 3. But Nineveh was a great city of God. 
For what we read in our Latin Bible: itinere trium 
dierum, according to the Hebrew it is more correctly 


read like this: to pass through (transitu) in three days. 
For what they say, that the city had a quite extraordinary 
size, has not my approval, namely that one could hardly 
have passed through from one end to the other in three 
days. Jerome says that it was so large in circumference 
2c. Lyra has meant, it was an area which was 
surrounded by walls. | think that this city was hardly as 
big as Cologne or Erfurt. And the reason why | assume 
this is the passage in the last chapter, which moves me 
[Cap. 4, 11.]: "In which are more than one hundred and 
twenty thousand people" 2c. That is certainly a small 
number of people for a city of such size as they want. 
Hence the opinion: to pass through in three days, that is, 
which 





someone could easily wander at leisure in all the streets 
2c. Then in the Latin Bible also a great error has been 
committed in that the name of GOD is omitted, and it 
should be read thus: "it was a great city of GOD" (or 
before GOD). This name ["GOD"] all Hebrew copies 
have with great unanimity, and Jerome did not omit it in 
his Latin translation. And all the commentators pass by 
this very bravely. But it is certain that it is not called a 
city of God because it is built by God, for Assyria built it, 
which is evident from the tenth chapter of the first book 
of Moses, v. 11. Moreover, it is not called a city of God 
because it was ordered by the laws of God. Therefore, | 
consider that this is the opinion, as if to say that God took 
care of them, God took care of this city so that it would 
not perish, and that is why He sent prophets to them, so 
that they would turn from their evil ways and be saved. 
And this is what | have spoken of abundantly in the 
beginning of this prophet, that God is not only God to the 
Jews, but also to the Gentiles. 


934 


XXVI, 67 f. Interpretations about the prophets. . 


935 





V. 4 And Jonah began to go in a day's journey into 
the city. 


That is, he completed the third part of his sermon. - 


Instead of clamavit, it should more correctly read: he 
preached. 


There are forty days left, and Nineveh will perish. 


In exceedingly short words he describes the main 
point and goal of his sermon, but no doubt explained it in 
a great many words. As he preached, he used his 
passages of Scripture with which he testified that the 
wrath of God was present; he explained to them his 
mission from God, he reproached them for their sin and 
explained to them the cause of God's wrath 2c. 


V. 5. 1) Then the people of Nineveh believed in God 
and preached that they should fast. 


This passage is held against us by the enemies of 
faith, who think that they have completely won the victory 
against us, since the blind people read this [v. 10], that 
God looked at the works of the Ninevites, and, according 
to them, bring a testimony against the righteousness of 
faith. We do not want to be like them, with our eyes open, 
but look at the words of the Holy Spirit and consider them 
more carefully, namely, that it is not by chance that it is 
prefaced: "Then the people of Nineveh believed in 
GOD." This is the guide and rule by which everything 
must be judged that is added of works. For if faith is 
sincere in heart, it does not need any teacher of good 
works; it knows of itself what is proper to do. Thus the 
prophet Jonah proclaims only the pure word, for that is 
what he was sent to do, and prescribes nothing at all 
about works. But since the Ninivites believe the word, 
they do these works of their own free will under the 
guidance and impulse of faith, with which they testify to 
the inner faith by heart. Faith alone makes a man 
absolutely righteous, as is stated in the third, fourth and 
fifth chapters of the Letter to the Romans. 


1) In the Weimar edition, this verse number appears only before the 
next keyword. 





is written. After man has been justified by faith, the fruits 
of righteousness necessarily follow, since a good tree 
cannot but bear good fruit, a bad tree bad fruit, as Christ 
says [Matth. 7, 17]. We see quite the same here in all 
things, for he says thus, "Then the people believed" 2c. 
Therefore, works did not produce faith, but faith produced 
works. Therefore, this passage does not serve against 
us, but for us. 


And put on bags. 

This is a Hebrew way of speaking, as the Hebrews also 
say, Eat bread and drink water, where we say, "He has 
eaten and drunk." So here "to put on sackcloth" means to 
put off the delicious and splendid garments and to put on 
lowly ones. This is quite clear from many passages of 
Scripture. Is. 20, 2. it says: "Remove the sackcloth from 
your loins", likewise Cap. 50, 3.: "I clothe the heavens 
with darkness, and make its covering as sackcloth", that 
is, | make the heavens sad, foggy and dull. And in this 
prophet also we see this Hebrew mode of speech, for he 
says afterwards [v. 8.], "And shall wrap sackcloth about 
them both men and beasts." A sack is a whimsical 
garment for animals. 


V.6 And when this came before the king of Nineveh. 
Here we see what | said above about the power and 
effectiveness of the word preached by Jonah. Although 
the king had not heard Jonah preach, he preached 
himself after he had been informed of Jonah's sermon 
and converted the third part of the city through his 
sermon, 2) and stood up from his royal throne, took off 
his purple, and wrapped a sackcloth around himself, that 
is, a lowly garment, namely a mourning garment, by 
which he testified to his inner grief together with the other 
citizens. 


2) According to the Zwickau manuscript, it should read something 
like this: and converts the whole city by his preaching, after Jonah had 
converted the third part of the city 2c. 


936 L.xxvi, 69f. Interpretation of Jonah (2.), Cap. 3, 6-10. 


937 





And sat down in the ashes. 

This is also a Hebrew way of speaking, that is, his 
lowly sitting also corresponded to his lowly clothing; he 
sat in some lowly place where it was otherwise not 
proper for the king to sit. 


v. 7 And he cried out and said to Nineveh, by the 
commandment of the king and his mighty men, thus: 


Instead of ex ore regis et principum ejus, it should 
more correctly read: "By command of the king and his 
mighty ones." 


It shall cost neither man nor beast, neither ox nor 
sheep. 


God does not look at the works of animals, nor are 
they pleasing to Him; but in such a way, since it is done 
by faith, it cannot but please God supremely. Thus, faith 
causes everything to be exceedingly pleasing to God. 
For what is done by faith is right and pleasing to God, 
but everything that is not done by faith is sin, Romans 
14:23. So also the fasting of the animals pleased him, 
but it would have pleased him no less if the king had fed 
the animals. 


V. 8: And they shall cover themselves with sacks, 
both man and beast. 


That is, they should testify to their sadness and 
repentance; in order to display their sorrow because of 
sin, they should not dress splendidly. Thus, what a 
broken heart does by faith, no matter how ridiculous it 
may seem, is exceedingly pleasing to God. 





And let every man turn from his wicked way. 


This is true repentance, and this is true faith, to which 
then works also correspond, so that we do not turn from 
faith back to ungodliness, thinking that we believe. 


V. 9. Who knows, God wants to turn back. 


Here one asks why they doubt, since the certain faith 
is present. For if they had not hoped for grace and mercy 
from God, they would not have shown and manifested 
this hope through those works. And this is what | also 
said above: Faith is in battle with despair. For in 
temptation, when God seems to be against us and to be 
angry, faith feels the struggle with despair and yet is not 
defeated. 


V. 10. But God saw their works. 


The previous passage, as | have said, interprets this. 
They believed the word of God, and since they refrained 
from ungodliness, they testified to their inward faith with 
outward works, and for the sake of faith, which is the 
source and fountain of works, God regarded the works 
of the godly. Otherwise, everything that is not based on 
faith is sin. If the heart is impure and unbelieving, God 
does not like the works, no matter how glorious they may 
be in outward appearance, which the Holy Spirit explains 
most clearly in the Scriptures about Abel and Cain, Gen. 
4, 4. ff. 


The fourth chapter. 


The beginning of this chapter seems to be anticipated 


(per anticipationem dici), since the same is repeated 
afterwards, where he returns to the order of the history. 
1) For this is the way of the Hebrew language, that 


1) Weimar edition: ersdlt instead of reait. 


it has a ponderous (taediosam - morose) sentence 
structure and often repeats the same, as in the first 
Psalm [v. 4., according to the Hebrew): "Like chaff the 
wind scatters them." In this speech the pronoun "they" is 
entirely superfluous. And what she does in any 
abbreviated sentence, she does also ina 


938 L. XXVI, 70-72. interpretations on the prophets. 


long continuous speech, as can be seen in the fifth book 
of Moses, where Moses often makes many words when 
describing some history, which he then tends to repeat 
again completely, even in one and the same context. So 
| think that also this passage at the beginning of this 
chapter is anticipated, so that this is the order of history: 
God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way, 
and did them no evil. These words were not spoken 
immediately by Jonah, but after some days, after the 
sermon was completed, when he saw that what he had 
predicted would happen did not happen. And then follows 
what is written at the beginning of this chapter: Since 
Jonah waited thus some days, and that which he had 
foretold did not come to pass, since the Ninivites 
repented, Jonah [as it is said in the Vulgate] was afflicted 
with a great plague. But the Hebrew word rather means, 
"It grieved Jonah greatly." Christ also used this word in 
the Gospel, Matt. 6:34: "It is enough for every day to have 
its own plague." But he was unwilling because, before he 
went, he had set aside the command of the Lord, 
because he was frightened by the danger of death, as | 
said above, then because he did not want those to be 
saved 2c. And so he is angry that the Assyrians do not 
perish, the destroyers of the people of God. Here we see 
again what | have often said at the beginning of this 
prophet and elsewhere, and what the Scriptures 
everywhere indicate, that in the saints there are still 
remnants of the flesh left, which they do not lack until the 
old Adam perishes altogether. There is an excellent 
passage in the 14th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles 
[v. 15], where Paul and Barnabas say: "We are also men, 
subject to the same evils as you. And the author of the 
epistle of James says in the last chapter [v. 17] of Elijah: 
"Elijah was a man like us." They had flesh and blood just 
like us. Therefore, no matter how holy they may be, they 
sometimes fell out of weakness of the flesh, and most 
shamefully, as Jonah did here, who, though wonderfully 
proven and exercised in the faith, nevertheless did not 
gladly submit his will to the will of God. 





939 


can. The dear God wanted the Ninevites to be 
preserved; but Jonah is not the same, but he is angry 
and grumbles. No suffering, no challenge is sufficient to 
kill the old man; the old Adam does not cease to be like 
himself, no matter how great the challenge may be, if he 
does not finally perish completely and is strangled all at 
once. This is therefore written for our consolation, that 
just as divine grace did not impute sin to them, however 
great it was, because they were chosen and 
transplanted into the kingdom of grace, so sin will not be 
imputed to us either. Rom. 8, 1.: "There is therefore 
nothing condemnable in them that are in Christ JEsu", 
[v. 28.:] "to them all things must be for the best" 2c. And 
as they are saved under the shadow of the hand of the 
LORD, so shall we also be saved, and not despair if we 
still feel the remnant of the old flesh in us, which shall 
not cease [in us], even as it hath not ceased in the most 
holy people, until this old Adam also be utterly put to 
death; meanwhile we shall cleave unto Christ our Head. 
And this is the preaching of the kingdom of grace, that 
though sin remain in the saints, as it cannot be 
otherwise, yet it is not imputed to them, but is forgiven, 
as they pray daily 2c. 


V. 2. Ah, Lord, this is what | said (hoc est verbum 
meum). 

The Hebrew word dabar means a cause, a thing, a 
speech. So it says 5 Mos. 16, 19.: "The gifts blind the 


wise, and pervert the things (verba) of the righteous," 
that is, they pervert righteous things. This is how Jonah 
used it here. The Latin would simply say: "This is when 
| was still in my country, therefore | also wanted to flee 
to the sea. 


For | know that you are gracious and merciful. 
In the Psalms these words are often connected. And 


what he translates here by misericordia, the same word 
is also found in Moses 


1) In both the Erlangen and Weimar editions: aissinailis, where we 
think killlilis should be read. 


940 XXVI, 72-74. interpretation of Jonah (2.), Cap. 4, 2-7. 


[Ex. 33, 19.], whence the apostle Paul says in the letter 
to the Romans Cap. 9, 15. "Whom | have mercy on, | 
have mercy on" 2c. 


And of great goodness (misericordiae). 

This word actually means charity. Christ also used 
this expression in the Gospel [Matth. 9, 13]: "Il am 
pleased with mercy and not with sacrifice", that means, 
| want you to do good to others 2c. 


And let yourself repent of the evil. 
[Here it says: ignoscens super malitia, elsewhere 


(Joel 2, 13.)] praestabilis super malitia, sanderswo:] 
pO6uit6U8 8upErmalitia, that is, who is wont to revoke 
the plague which he had decided to lay out. These are 
all surely words of faith; if one can grasp and imagine 
GOt in this way, that is surely life and blessedness. And 
this right and sincere faith is with Jonah, and yet he is 
angry with GOtte. Thus the flesh and the spirit clash. 
This is the battle in the saints and an irreconcilable war, 
as | said above. 


V. 3. Now therefore, O Lord, take my soul from me. 

These are also words of a great spirit, that he desires 
to be dissolved, desires death; but nevertheless this is 
also a carnal heart movement, for he feared the shame 
if that did not come to pass, which he had predicted 
would come to pass according to the word of God. 


V. 4. Do you think you are justly angry? 


As if to say: this is not the case. 


V. 5. And Jonah went out to the city. 
Here he returns to the order of the history. And if 
everything in this chapter, which now follows, should be 
connected with the preceding zttsammen, it would be so 
to connect: For Jonah had gone out of the city 2c. But 
behold the extraordinary forbearance and goodness of 
the dear God, behold the admirable kindness of the 
divine majesty, how he deals and plays with the foolish 
and angry Jonah, as he bears his displeasure and 
convicts him by his own saying. That is, of course, 
treating sinners sweetly and fatherly. Here is certainly a 


941 


An excellent example of divine kindness to those who, 
after being justified, still sin. See how he closes his eyes, 
how he argues with the grumbling Jonah! In order for 
Jonah to completely abandon his anger and stop 
grumbling, divine goodness provides him with an arbor 
or a small hut under which he can sit and enjoy the 
shade until the heat of the sun breaks. 


V. 6. 1) And delivered him from his evil. 


[Instead of et protegeret eum, laboraverat enim in 
the Vulgate] the Hebrew says: that he saved him from 


his evil (a malitia). This saying can be understood in 
two ways: first, that the Lord provided an epheu 


(hederam) that grew up over Jonah, so that the shadow 
of the epheu delighted him and saved him from his evil, 
that is, from his affliction, so that Jonah would no longer 
be distressed by the conversion of the Ninivites. For it is 
the same Hebrew word here as above [v. 1]. The other 
opinion, which | like better, is this: so that the Lord would 
punish and chastise him for being so evil-minded, so that 
Jonah, instructed and convicted by his own example, 
would confess that his unwillingness and murmuring 
was foolish. | accept this second view; if someone does 
not like it, he may follow the former. Incidentally, among 
the holy people there has been an extraordinary and 


certainly distasteful dispute about the word hedera 
[epheu]. For this is how Jerome translates it, while the 
old translation before Jerome had "gourd". It is useless 
to argue about a trivial matter, since the Hebrew word 
means neither epheu nor a gourd, but it is the name of 
a tree unknown to us, peculiar to that country. But 
Jerome gives the reason why he translated epheu. See 
the interpretations of Jerome. 


V. 7. But the Lord provided a worm. 


By doing this, the Lord wanted to refute the unjust 
displeasure of Jonah, but the divine majesty does this 
by a very fatherly and kind example, as | have said.

V. 8. 1) That he became dull. 


The Hebrew word actually means: to sink down 
powerless, which the Germans’ express by 
"verschmachten". It is the same word above in the eighth 
chapter of Amos [v. 13], where we read: "At that time 
beautiful virgins and young men will pine away because 
of thirst. 


Then he wished death to his soul. 


Here he returns to order again. For of course | cannot 
believe that the Lord spoke to Jonah twice like this: "Do 
you think that you are justly angry? 


V. 9. | will be angry with you until death. 

Behold the obstinate murmurer, who will not desist 
from his ways! This prophet is certainly strange: since he 
has been provoked by the Lord, his anger grows. Thus 
sin tends to be heaped upon sin, thus one sin tends to 
give birth to another. 


V. 10. The gourd mourns you because you have not 
worked on it. 


As if he wanted to say: You grieve for your gourd, 
which is now withered, which you man did not prepare, 
and even though you did not prepare it, you are 
displeased that the worm has eaten it. | God, who 
created Nineveh, and in it so many men and animals, 
should not spare them, should not be patient, should not 
rejoice in their salvation? This is a glorious and 
exceedingly sweet word of the divine majesty, this is an 
exceedingly rich promise of the incomprehensible 
goodness and mercy of God. He does not want the 
sinner to die, but rather to be converted and to live. This 
praises God's grace to us, that he grieves over our 
destruction and rejoices over our salvation, as the 
parable of the Prodigal Son in the Gospel [Luc. 15, 11. 
ff.] shows. In the same way as here, Christ spoke in 
Matth. 7, II: "If you, who are evil, can still give good gifts 
to your children, how much more will your Father in 
heaven" 2c. 


: 11. who do not know difference what is right or

|): This verse number is missing in the Weimar edition. 





This is a way of speaking of the Hebrew language; 
we speak differently, in such a way: They know nothing, 
neither this nor that, and as we say in German, "They 
know not what is white o.der black," namely, as to 
blessedness;. they know no_ difference between 
godliness and godlessness, they have not the word of 
God.... Therefore, if they only knew as much as you 
know, dear Jonah, they might be better than you are, as 
has happened. For after they heard the preaching of 
Jonah, they were immediately converted, believing the 
word and repenting, while Jonah meanwhile grumbled 
and railed against the Lord. 

| leave the secret interpretation to your reflection and 
diligence. For Christ Himself refers in the Gospel [Matth. 
12, 39. 40. 16, 4.] this example of Jonah to Himself, 
namely that He is depicted in Jonah, as He says: "This 
wicked and adulterous kind seeks a sign, and no sign 
shall be given to it but the sign of the prophet Jonah. For 
as Jonah was three days and three nights" 2c. This 
history is extraordinarily glorious, so that Christ also 
seems to have delighted in it, which can be seen in this 
very [twelfth] chapter of Matthew, where he remembers 
the people of Nineveh, where Christ certainly speaks 
gloriously of this history. And so this history is praised in 
both Testaments. Now Christ came upon the sea, that is, 
into the world. And since he had come into the world, the 
sea becomes void for his sake, since the Son of God is 
received by some, but not by others in the same way. He 
is swallowed up by the whale, that is, by the devil, the 
prince of this world. For the devil and hell and death 
devoured Christ while he was hanging on the cross, as if 
they wanted to destroy him, but he could not be kept 
[from death], for that was impossible, as Peter says 
Apost. 2:24. 2, 24. Therefore he had to spit him out again, 
and so he became alive again, and this became the 
cause of life, what before was the cause of death. Thus 
death has become the door to life for us, shame is a 
promotion to glory, condemnation and hell to 
blessedness, and that through Christ who was innocent 
2c. 

To Christ be praise and glory..;

945 





3, Luther's lectures on the prophet Jonah, 


according to the Zwickau manuscript. *) 


Delivered probably in February 1525; printed in 1886. 


Translated from Latin. 


The prophet Jonah. 


[V. 1.) "Amithai" [stands in Hebrew instead of Amathi in 
the Vulgate]. [V 2.J in is as much as ad; quia as much 


as quoniam. [V 3.] naulum is "ferry money." 
The first question is about the time and person of this 
[prophet]. Before the time of a great disturbance, there 
came prophets [whom God sent] to save some. In the 
time of Jeroboam there were many prophets; at that time 
it seems to me that this Jonah was. See the second book 
of Kings, where Jonah 1) is spoken of [Cap. 14, 25. 27.]: 
For the LORD would not destroy Israel, as he spake [by 
his servant Jonah] 2c. This passage indicates the time of 
the prophet. He was at the same time as Amos and 
others. If this is so, the fable of Jonah falls that he was 
the son of the widow of Zarpath 2c. As this is easily 
[said], 2) so it is also easily despised. This prophet was 
a Jew, that one the son of a Gentile. Amithai means 
[taken appellatively]: my truth. See the passage in the 
[first] book of Kings [Cap. 17] of the widow 2c. with Elijah. 
3) "Amithai" is the name of the father. Thus | hold for it. 
His office was to prophesy to the Gentiles and to 
preach to the Assyrians at Nineveh. Therefore, the king 
of Assyria had not yet disturbed Israel. At that time, the 
kingdom of the Assyrians was the most powerful 
dominion.

2) In the original: ste. 
3) In the manuscript: eurn Isais, which the Erlanger has retained. 





However, it is a great burden and [a heavy] office that a 
few man should attack a whole kingdom, and the most 
powerful one at that. GOD "has lifted up the prophet," it 
is a great task. And here you see that GOD also cares 
for the Gentiles, for the enemies of His people, so that 
He sends a prophet from among His people. The Jews 
alone boasted of the law 2c., Rom. 2, 23. Below [Cap. 3, 
5.J it is said: They feared the Lord 2c. There is no 
circumcision, and so God has had His Christians and 
saints throughout the world, though we do not see it. 
That one is sent is a glorious and inestimable sign of 
love, Rom. 3, 29. The Jews are ordained that they should 
keep what God has spoken through the prophets about 
Christ, that he should be preached in the whole world 2c. 
[If we consider what the word has accomplished, it is an 
exceedingly glorious history, otherwise it seems to be 
small. 4) The fruit of the word is described exceedingly 
abundantly in Jonah. Hardly any apostle would have 
directed [what] he directed in three days 2c. So much for 
the ministry. 

With the holy fathers this fault is that they want to absolve 
the saints from sins, and also to us it is offensive that we 
see the saints stumbling. [They raise the question 
whether Jonah sinned in that he be-

pale to throw him into the sea. Jerome answers that this 
is allowed when chastity is in danger]. 1) They did not 
pay attention to the realm of grace. The judgment 
according to faith "cannot fail me", according to works | 
cannot judge 2c. One man kills and does not sin, another 
man kills and sins, because the spirit of the one is 
different from that of the other, the faith of the one is 
different from that of the other. A Christian must be 
judged by the favor and grace of God, 2c., or by the 
realm of favor shown to man, not by that shown to man. 
The saints had flesh and blood like us, but when the 
Spirit came upon them, they prophesied 2c. [Jac. 5:17:] 
"Elias was a man like unto us." They had the same word, 
the same spirit [as we have]; if | sometimes judge 
foolishly, so did they 2c. A Christian "must not" be judged 
by outward appearance, but by the Spirit 2c. We are 
under the kingdom of grace, not of the law. Thus we say 
that Jonah sinned as we do. Either he did so full of faith 
and the Spirit, or empty of the Spirit 2c. God judges him 
by the spirit 2c. As long as a prophet lives in the flesh, 
he sins and falls as we do 2c. Surely the sin was great; 
the punishment, the retribution

of sin shows all this, the impetuosity of the sea. He has 
the word: "Go", and he does not go 2c. We magnify the 
sin of Jonah, so that we poor sinners who fall daily 2) 
may have comfort 2c. Because he would not have been 


under the kingdom of grace and a dear child (filius 


albae gallinae - a lucky child), he would certainly not 
have returned, but would have had to pay for this neglect 
with death 2c. Of the fish he knew nothing. To be 
punished with such a cruel death is certainly something 
great; something great is also to be able to persevere in 
faith with such a conscience. He committed the sin of 
disobedience: according to his office he was a prophet 
and should have preached; secondly, he had a peculiar 
profession 2c. This is written for us, that we may not 
despair, though punishment and vengeance be present 
2c. It is great faith when one feels the punishment and 
has an evil conscience, and yet perseveres. [Ps. 117, 
18.:]""The LORD chasteneth me well [, but giveth me not 
to death]." The fathers "may have had a mind," but 
surely they lacked judgment. Here we are concerned 
with the sanctity of grace, not works 2c. They have made 
of the Scriptures a terror to us, not a comfort. Although 
those who are in the kingdom of grace sin, they are not 
condemned because they are in the kingdom of mercy 
2c.

- "Their wickedness has come up before me" is a Hebrew 
phrase as in the first book of Moses [Cap. 18, 21.]. Not 
as if God does not always see 2c. So it seems to us s 
that our wickedness comes before GOD when we feel in 
conscience that GOD is angry with us]. 1) - There is an 
emphasis on "before me". Before the world it is a very 
respectable kingdom, before me they are "of the devil". 
He certainly sinned for a great cause, because the flesh 
is weak and the task is great. One must look with a 
simple-minded eye at the word 2c. If this is not done, the 
eyes "will drown" in the greatness of the work or the task.

V. 3 [But Jonah arose, and fled before the Lord, and 
went to the sea, and came down to Japho]. 


| do not approve of the interpretation of Tharsis 
["sea"] from the fatherland of Paul. | think that it is the 
special name of a sea, as we divide the sea into the 
Caspian Sea, the Persian Sea 2c., the ocean, which 
flows around the earth. hotu in Hebrew quite generally 
all seas. What is called a sea in Hebrew, Lucas [Cap. 5, 


1.] calls "the lake" (stagnum) of Galilee. Tharsis [‘/“n] 
is called in Hebrew the middle sea. 


The sea is called the land sea, the red sea, the Indian 
sea and the ocean 2c. After three kingdoms Solomon 


sent ships to the sea (in Tharsis) (2 Chron. 9, 21. 20, 


36.]. It cannot be One Tharsis. Likewise in Isaiah (Cap. 
23, 1.], "Hail, ye ships of the sea." Likewise in the Psalm 
[Ps. 72, 10.]: "The kings of the sea," where it speaks of 
the Mediterranean sea, that is, the kings of the 


Mediterranean sea. Tharsis is called the "great sea" in 
Hebrew. Jonah did not want to flee to any city, but "where 


he would go" so that he would not have to "preach". - 
"Before the Lord." | do not dislike that it is said here: 


1) Added by us instead of etc. in the original. 
2) In our original, there are two glosses to v. 5 and v. 6, which are 


before the kingdom of Israel, where God dwelt, where 
He had His worship. There God was present; as if he 
wanted to say: | want to flee to where God is not served, 
not worshipped, not preached 2c. For if | remain in the 
land, GOtt is always there 2c. - "Japho" is a port of the 


midland sea, so Tharsis is the sea 2c. - ("That wanted 


to go to the sea"). Intrantem is better than euntem. It 
looks at the heart movement of the prophet, "who 
wanted to flee wherever he went", if only he could flee 
from the Lord. 


V. 4. Then the Lord sent a great wind on the sea. 


The summa of this prophecy is: Jonah is sent as an 
apostle to the Gentiles. A great task! The Assyrians have 
been disturbed [later] by the king of the Chaldeans and 
the Persians. This prophecy has been a postponement 
of the vengeance and the disturbance which came over 
them afterwards 2c. 


Periclitabatur [conteri], that is, "one wept the ship 


would break” 2c. - (V. 5.] Interiora, that is, "down into 
the ship." - [V. 6. "Then the master of the ship came up 
to him and said to him,] What are you sleeping for?" 2c. 
3) - This prophet is easy when the simple histories are 
allseen. The simple histories require a great heart 
movement and attentiveness to the things that are in the 
history. See that one person is sent to convert an 
exceedingly powerful and very godless kingdom. Notice 
the pusillanimity of Jonah. This is a great sin, so that he 
must die twice. This matter is treated seriously. It was an 
exceedingly great and serious sin. He is distressed by a 
double evil, by his conscience and by the retribution; he 
feels the sin and the vengeance, the impetuosity of the 
sea. In this spiritual consternation there still remains a 
spark of faith. There is a greater storm in Jonah's 
conscience than on the sea. If we were so challenged, 
we would raise many questions 4) 2c. -

Where there is a strong hand and you can work, do not

It is a Hebrew phrase: "the fear of GOD." This is what 
that true worship is called. In the Psalm it says [Ps. 19, 
8.]: "The law of the Lord is without change" 2c. He 
speaks of fear as of the law. The law is holy, the fear [of 
the Lord] is holy.

in the wrath of God.

Reverterentur is "that they would come back to

one man, all in the ship innocently come into danger 2c. 
For the sake of a man, "God shall punish a country," but 
for the sake of a man, again, "God shall punish [a whole 
country]. There are many examples of this. Are the 
others innocent? No. This is written for this reason, so 
that we may take care that sins do not go unnoticed; [we 
are to realize that] sin will not go unpunished. 2c.

was to be drowned, he feels death in death, he is 
swallowed by the fish 2c. He is in death and does not 
die. Here it is indicated how [GOD] is the Lord of the 


"deeper in the jaws" of death than he is now 2c. He is a 
Lord to make blessed, therefore he "pushes into" death. 


The second chapter. 


[V. 1.] "And Jonah was [in the body of the fish]."-[V. 3. 
"Out of the belly of hell," that is,] out of the body of the 


fish. - [Instead of inferi it should read] inferni.-[V. 4. 
Instead of] gurgites [would have been better translated] 


"thy billows" (fracturae tuae). - We hear the punishment 
of Jonah. It is an example of a sinner and lost man who 
is condemned and has been preserved in damnation. 
This example should be presented to all sinners. The 
Lord is present in death and can be preserved in death 
2c. He makes alive and kills [1 Sam. 2, 6.], he knows how 
to preserve in death and in hell. In the death [of Jonah] a 
greater danger is added, namely this is the fish that 
swallows him. He thought, "Deeper into the sea." It 
seemed to him as if he was going completely into the 
right hell; here he was certainly in the struggle of life with 
death. Faith began to fight after being drowned and 
swallowed 2c. In the animal he felt that he was not yet 
dying. His song is witness to the thoughts he had in his 
heart. He felt that he was not yet dying, and yet he 
struggled with death. Such sighs in the face of death [like 
his] are inexpressible. There are two deaths: being 
drowned, and being consumed and digested in the fish, 
and yet here he feels the hand of God. He has always 
had death before his eyes: How? if he would now still be 
digested? 2) He is in darkness, he does not see the sun 
2c. "He must have had whimsical" thoughts 2c. If it is not

of the Scriptures, one could hardly believe it 2c. If God 
understands this art, who would not believe and trust 
Him? Here is a sinner in the greatest sin, in the greatest 
despair 2c., and yet he is not abandoned. 


V. 1. [But the LORD provided a great fishZ 


The Hebrew verb means that something is in 
readiness 2c., "he provided". In such a manner GOD 
orders all his things: he made to be there in readiness. - 
("Three days and] three nights." "Whether that be 
whole," little is concerned with that. flt will be] according 
to the figure of the synecdoche [spoken of] 2c. He could 
not count [the days and nights] for fear 2c. in the body of 
the whale, but afterward 2c. 


V. 2. 3, [And Jonah prayed to the Lord 2c.] 


But he prayed. Instead of 6xauai8t1 it should be "you 
heard." This song describes how he had been in the 
body [of the fish], in the fear to sense. After his salvation, 
he put it into a song. - "I cried out." "Yes indeed." The 
song is against works, for mercy. - "In anguish" is "to do 
no more" than to despair of merits and works. One 
confesses his sins and does not despair of being 
unworthy of mercy. [Jonah] was a "bold man" who could 
cry out to GOD who was angry. One need not judge of 
GOD by what one feels. Sometimes one feels him as an 
angry one.

should he therefore not be favorable? You feel him to be 
a gracious one,-is he therefore favorable? No. "Believe 
him not" when he "dealeth amicably," but fear. Believe 
him according to his mercy. The right gift of faith shall 
ever remain 2c. - "And he answered 1) me," that "lacketh 
not." It is an imitation of what is written in the Psalm [Ps. 
118, 5.], "In anguish | called upon the Lord, and the Lord 
heard me." He feels that his prayer has been heard, in 
the midst of the body [of the fish]. He who does not feel 
this does not pray well. [Every prayer must feel that it 
has been heard. In the Gospel it says Marc. 5, 30/: "And 
JEsus immediately felt from Himself the power that had 
gone out from Him" 2c. He who does not believe that he 
is heard, is not heard. Fear made him call, not with the 
voice, but with the heart 2c. - 2) "Out of the belly of hell." 
He speaks according to what is to his mind. Those who 
are in fear seem to go to hell. That is why when someone 
is in extreme tribulation, it is called the deepest hell. It 
seems as if they are afflicted by the whole world 2c. It is 
not a certain place; there is nothing about it in Scripture 
2c. The word of GOD has upheld it. This is the hand of 
the LORD: the fish "would have digested" him; he 
sustains him by the word; "this" is what faith does. 


V. 4. You threw me 3) into the deep in the middle of 
the sea. 

He describes the tribulation 2c. This is a long 
description of the sinking [into the sea] and the 
tribulation. - "That the floods compassed me about" 2c. 
This is from the Psalm "As the Deer Cries" 2c. [Ps. 42, 
8.] - In corde maris, that is, into the depth of the sea, 
as Christ says [Matth. 12, 40.]: in in corde terrae, that 
is, "in the midst of the earth." [5 Mos.4, 11. it says: USque 


ad Cor] [that means: "until

in the midst of heaven") 2c. It is a Hebrew way of 
speaking. Ps. 45, 6. reads: In ooraea iniinioornin rsZis, 
that is, in the midst. "Since the sea is deepest, enemies 
thickest" 2c. - "That the floods surrounded me," "I was 


drowned." - [Instead of gurgites it should more correctly

German we say "Wogen und Wellen, Bulgen." "All thy 
billows and waves passed over me," all the impetuosity 
of the sea covered me 2c. He says: "your" [waves], "that 
hurts". He judges that this did not happen by chance, but 
"you do [it], Lord". When one feels that God inflicted this, 
that is to feel the wrath of God: "You did it, you did it" 4)

V. 5. 5) [That | thought | was cast out from your

And |, as was to my mind at that time, 6) thought |

floods drove him to despair. These signs forced me to 
say 2c. These are deep inexpressible sighs of the spirit 
"in distress, from the bottom of it the heart groans." This 
is from the Psalm [Ps. 31, 23.], "| spoke in my trembling," 
that is, in my fear and hurrying away 7) [from you], | am

V. 6. Water surrounds me to my very life. 


"To my life," that is, to death. The sea had flowed 
around my head. The sea, in which there are reeds, the 
sea of reeds had surrounded my head with a bandage. 
The sea, which has on its shores. has reeds and rushes, 
"that was my crown". "In Moses [2 Mos. 28, 40. we read 
of] untying hoods", head bandages, "I shall one day 
become a peacock". Depths were around me, reeds 
embraced my head. The Hebrew word means storm 2c., 


we have [in the Vulgate] pelagus. 


V. 7. | sank down to the foundations of the 
mountains; the earth had shut me up forever. 


"To the bottom of the mountains", where the 
mountains have an end, that is, to the deepest bottom of 
the sea. Thither | have sunk down, where the lowest of 
the mountains is. The earth "comprehended" me. | was 
locked up, as it were, 2c., like one who is locked up with 
bolts. It was refused to him to go out, because he was as 
it were shut up with bolts. The earth with its bolts | had 
eternally before me, "around and around, must well 
remain". | thought, "There is never any escape here." All 
delay [of salvation] is the mother of impatience, and so 
with all who are in tribulations [the thought that it is] an 
eternity follows. - "But thou hast brought my life out of thy 


corruption (de perditione) 1)" is from the Psalm [Ps. 16, 
10. Vulg.]: "Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see 


corruption (corruptionem)." Thou wilt wholly deliver me 


from “corruption” (Corruptione). "O Lord, thou wilt yet 
help."

V. 8 When my soul was in despair, | remembered the 
Lord, and my prayer came to you in your holy temple. 


This is a motto. He decides "how one should do", as 
if he wanted to say: "This is how | have done, this is how 
others should do".] 2) When someone is in need, he 
remembers the Lord; "just remember" that you call. The 
short epitome of this song is: Works count for nothing, 
no man's holiness or wisdom. 3) If you should be 
"afraid", "drop everything" 2c. "Call upon me in distress" 
2c. [Ps. 50, 15. "When | was in anguish and distress, | 
remembered the Lord.” 


V. 9. 4) Those who hold above that which is not, 
forsake their grace. 


"This is what the Spirit "soon does" [that he, instructed 
by experience, teaches others also; 5) we see this] often 
in the Psalms. You cannot "serve God much" than by 
crying out to God in distress; it is nothing that you labor 


with works. Those who do this (illos), he calls people 
who hold above the void 2c. - ‘rustra. 6) They hold in 
vain over that which is void, that is, those works and that 
for which they care are void 2c. These are the people 
who forsake their mercy, that is, they forsake the mercy 
which they should hope for from you. It comes to us to 
look to mercy. The mercy of God is ours because it is 
promised to us. It is necessary to hold on to it", but they 
are struggling with uncertain affirmations. "It grieves the 
spirit when it sees that the mercy is not respected.

The third chapter. 


[V. 3. According to the Hebrew it should be called 
Magna Deo [in the Vulgate "GOD" or "before GOD" is 
missing].- [Instead of itinere it should be:] Transitu 


trium dierum [to pass through in three days]. - This 
chapter is very easy as far as grammar is concerned. 1) 
Nineveh was the capital of the kingdom of the Assyrians. 
Above you have heard of the greatness of the ministry 
laid upon Jonah, that he, a certain man 2c. Before the 
world this preaching was foolish, because of the 
greatness of the kingdom, because of the lowliness of 
the person, because of the greatness of the thing which 
he preached: it would come to pass that Nineveh should 
be disturbed after forty days. This was not believed by 
Lot of Sodom; it was incredible that so great a city would 
perish. The kingdom of the Affyrians was powerful, it 
threatened the kingdom of Israel from the greatest 
proximity; therefore he took the office to preach against 
the enemies of his kingdom. 


V. 2. Preach to her the sermon that | tell you. 


This is a proof point that one should preach nothing 
but the word of the Lord. 


Then Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, as the Lord 
had said. 

He went, as the Lord had said, fearing that he would 
again fall from the fish.

Itinere, better transitu. - To resolve the question, much 
has been said of the greatness of this city. Some say 
that it could have been traveled through in three days

was so large in circumference. Another says Lyra: it was 
not a city, but a stretch of land surrounded with walls. | 
think that it was not so large; like Cologne, | think. At the 
end [Cap. 4, 11.] it is said [ that nothing two hundred 
thousand people [had been in it] 2c. [There it is said:] "In 
which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand 
people." 2) This moves me 2c. If there are more [people], 
it is still nothing with the assumption of the immense 
size].Nowadays one can [well] find a city in which so 
many people are, and yet it is not large. Someone could 
walk through it in all the gapes, 2c. so that he could go 
through it in three days, 3) "go around" like "a preacher 
monk". It is a city that one could wander through in three 
days, "walk through" through all the gaffes. Wes-

half does he call it"a city of GOD" or before GOD? It is 
certain that GOD did not build it, but [like] Nimrod [Babel, 
so did] Assyria build the city [Nineveh], as written in the 
first book of Moses [Cap. 10, 8. ff. is written. Second, it 
was not ordered with laws of GOD, like Jerusalem, 
where GOD dwelt. Therefore, he says that God took care 
of this city, that God took special care of it, that He did 
not want to disturb it, and that He sent a prophet from His 
Jewish people 2c. God is not only the God of the Jews, 
but also of the Gentiles. 


Vv. 4. 1) And Jonah began to go in a day's journey 
into the city. 


Itinere [that is, a day's journey] he went about "as far" 
as he could. The third part [of the city] he visited with his 
sermon, as far as he could go around in one day. But he 
did not go through the whole city with his sermon, he 
does not say that. 


Preaching, he said, "Forty days are left, and 
Nineveh will perish. 


With very short words he describes this sermon after its 
main part. It must be assumed that he has elaborated it 
with a lot of words. He has added his reasons of proof 
why it happens, why God is angry 2c. But he alone gives 
the subject: God 2c. Here one disputes why he did not 
add: if they would not do evil 2c. 


V. 5. Then the people of Nineveh believed in God, 
and preached fasting, and put on sackcloth, both great 
and small. 


They have put on [sacks], both great and small. 2) The 
king has taken off his purple robe. [The king cried out 
and said, "Let the sheep and the oxen also cover 
themselves with sackcloth; let both men and beasts cry 
fiercely to God, and let every man turn from his wicked 
ways. 2c." "The preaching is greater than these" [, men 
and beasts, put on sackcloth]. It is said to us who preach: 
faith alone is the

2) Here our template has no punctuation mark. 





Justice, held against: This passage "preaches," against 
the doctrine of faith. They [the adversaries] say against 
us, Thus Nineveh [was saved by works] 2c. Likewise the 
text says [v. 10;P. "But since GOD saw their works" 2c. 
We must "put off spectacles," and see what was said 
before, namely, "Then the people of Nineveh believed in 
GOD." They [the Adversaries] think that God and the 
Holy Spirit "care less about believing in" the word than 
they do. It is not necessary to prescribe to true and 
sincere faith what must be done, as here Jonah 
prescribes nothing, no works; here is the word alone. 
The believers do this immediately of their own free will. 
Against them [the adversaries is this text. The sacks and 
the fasting would have been nothing, but God saw their 
faith. First they believe, then they do works. Faith does 
this only to justify a man; when he is justified, works no 
longer do anything. He describes that they first became 
righteous, and because their glow is pleasing, all their 
works are also pleasing. Faith did these works. If they 
have believed, they are righteous; but if they are 
righteous, they also do works. True faith does not cease 
from works. They believe the words and threats of God; 
they would not do the works if they did not believe. To 
put on sackcloth does not mean to clothe oneself with a 
"hop sack," but it is a Hebrew expression, as eating 
bread, drinking water. [The Germans say:] "Give to eat, 
[to] drink", the Hebrews say: water and bread "give". It 
means to lay aside the delicious and splendid garments, 
and to santhun a bad, lowly garment]. "Remove the 
sackcloth from thy loins," says Isaiah [Cap. 20:2]. "I 
clothe the heavens with sackcloth" [Isa. 50, 3.]. "The sun 
was like sackcloth made of hair," Revelation 6:12. When 
the heavens are sad, dim, foggy, "that is his" sackcloth; 
when there is a fiasco of the sun 2c. To clothe oneself 
with a mourning garment, to display sadness,

that is, put on a sack 2c. With a sack, that is, with low 
and low clothes. 


V. 6. And when this came before the king 2c. 

"This must have been a pious king." Behold the fruit 
of the word: the king himself did not hear it, but through 
the rumor of the third part [of the city] it reached [him] 2c. 
By his and his mighty command the whole city believes. 
A great efficacy of the word, the like of which is not seen 
in any other preacher. It is much greater than in Peter's 
first sermon [Apost. 2, 14. ff.], where three thousand 
[gladly received the word] 2c. "Bad thing" 2c. The king 
put on a lowly garment, as befits a lowly man. It is 
something great: "a king" 2c. - "To sit in ashes" means 
to have a low and lowly gift and seat. Thus it is said in 
Isaiah [Cap. 47:1], "Sit in the ashes." That is, he sat ina 
low place, that he might show his sorrow by his 
garments, by outward gestures 2c. 


V. 7 And he cried out and said to Nineveh, by the 
commandment of the king and his mighty men, thus: 


EX ore, that is, by order, by decree of the king. "This 
must have been a beautiful edict." Perhaps the king 
signed himself and the authorities of the kingdom. - "Men 
and cattle." What has God to do with the fasting of oxen? 
By all means nothing; so also [nothing with the fasting] 


of men (illorum). When faith is there, 





so GOtte pleases the works, even if oxen, "cows fast". 
Because here is the faith, also the fasting of the oxen 
pleases him. This hunger they shall suffer, that they may 
cry out 2c. "So that", by this faith, "they gain our 
HErrgod". - "Water," they shall [not] be watered. 


V. 8: And they shall cover themselves with sacks, 


both man and beast. 

They display their sadness, crying out "for food". GOD 
calls this good, because faith and the bruised heart "so 
foolishly attack it". Everything is well-pleasing that goes 
along in fear; even "that" is well-pleasing which is 
otherwise lowly and rejected 2c. - "And let every man 
repent of his wicked way." It is not true repentance unless 
the life is also changed. First the sinner must be crushed, 
and the conscience because of sin 2c. 


V. 9. Who knows, God wants to turn back. 


Why does he doubt, since true faith does not doubt? 
Faith is a struggle; the words of faith in fear are words of 
despair. Faith speaks according to how it feels. Fear is 
there; the contestation has the upper hand and forces 
him to break out into a word of despair or doubt. GOD 
has regarded the works, namely [because they are] 
[done] in faith. For the preceding text "regulates" the 
following: "Then the people believed" 2c.

The beginning of this chapter seems to be 
anticipated, because these words are repeated 
afterwards, as it is used to happen in the Hebrew 
language, as [Ps. 1, 4. according to the Hebrew]: "Like 
chaff, which the wind scatters" 2c. So it happens also in 
a whole speech and sentence structure. Thus repeats 


966 L. XXVI, 25-27. Interpretations on the prophets. 


In the fifth book, Moses uses the same abundance of 
words that he used in the beginning. Thus, the fact that 
he asks and is angry is anticipated here. This is the order 
of history: God saw their works, their fasting 2c. But 
Jonah ordered these words much later, seeing that the 
city would not be disturbed, seeing that his words had not 
been fulfilled 2c. For it is added. [V. 5.], "And Jonah went 
out to the city" 2c. The construction "go as it may", the 
order of history must be observed. He waited some days, 
perhaps forty days 2c. When he saw that the evil did not 
come, "he was angry. 


V. 1. Jonah was almost very upset and angry. 


Afflictus here means: "This made him very angry", [he 
was] "ill at ease". [Christ used this word Matth. 6, 34. So 
it is said of Moses [4 Mos. 12, 3.] that he was a troubled 
man 2c. And it grieved him, he was very angry, that he 
alone should be sent to the great city, to the enemies 
whom he would not have saved; he feared the danger of 
death. These are the two causes of his anger. He is 
unwilling that the spoilers of the Israelites should not 
perish. This is how it must be in the hearts [of the saints], 
so that they remain human beings. The Holy Spirit is not 
distributed according to the fullness as it is in Christ. In 
the Acts of the Apostles [Cap. 14, 15.] it is said of Paul 
and Barnabas that they said, "We are men, even as ye 
are. "2c. The saints suffer the same: follies, infirmities 2c. 
God has forbidden that anyone should do better than he 
can. Therefore, Jonah remains weak, like another man 
who cannot submit to the word of God. He does not want 
them to be saved, GOD wants them to be. From this 
challenge [that he was devoured he should have become 
anew man, | believe, "they should have mortificiren him" 
2c. [The flesh] is not cut off in this life; "nothing better [, 
than] neck cut off" and "scraped into the earth" 2c. [This 
serves for our consolation, and shows what the kingdom 
of God is like, namely, that the saints

again, if only he always looks, and hangs on the head 
Christo 2c. This is seen in the great apostles; they 
always had the flesh "running after". 


V. 2. 3) Oh, Lord, this is what | said while | was still 
in my country. 


[In terra mea means according to the Hebrew:] 


Super terram meam. - Verbum means a cause, a thing, 
a speech. [So it is said Deut. 16, 19:] "The gifts make 


[the wise] bund [, and traffic] verba, [that is] the things of 
the righteous." The Latins would say, "This is what 4) | 
said to myself while | was still [in my country]; [I] "knew 
that it should happen this way," because | know that You 
are a gracious and merciful God. [These two words 
"gracious" and "merciful"] are often linked together in the 
Psalms. This passage is taken from the Psalms. In 
Genesis [Ex. 33:19] is a passage quoted in the ninth 
chapter of the Letter to the Romans [v. 15]: "Whom | am 
gracious, | am gracious; and whom | have mercy on, | 
have mercy on. 


"patient”, that is longanimis, "long-suffering". 5) 
- Misericordiam, that is, Wohlthatigkeit, wohlthun 2c. - 
In Joel [Cap. 2, 13.] 6) it says: praestabilis super 


malitia; elsewhere: poenitens super malitia, that is, 
he who out of mercy revokes the evil which he had 
decided to expose, which | deserved. This man stands 
in faith, faith speaks [from him] in the best way, and yet 
he is angry. The flesh and the spirit clash. No one can 
speak like this unless he is in the spirit. He fears that he 
may be a false prophet.

we had to change the order. Likewise with the following gloss.

V. 3. Now therefore, O Lord, take my soul from me. | Malitia means a plague; that he saved him from his 


These are words of a great spirit, that he wishes to be 
dissolved, that he hates this life. Out of the flesh the spirit 
must speak: "I would rather be dead than live." 1) "It 
grieves" when one is taken in a lie and yet speaks the 
truth from the mouth of God. 


V. 4. But the Lord said, "Do you think that you are 
2) justly angry? 
He abhors his anger, but it is a venial sin for him. He 


speaks according to the flesh, bearing his weakness 2c. 
So far everything is anticipated. 


V. 5. And Jonah went out to the city. 


Or: For Jonah had gone out; so it would come in order 
2c. He had sat down, he had made [himself a hut], that 
is, what would happen. This happened after the sermon. 
He waited to see if his prophecy would be fulfilled; 
meanwhile he hears that they repented 2c. But God does 
not play with the childish and foolish Zirner only with 
words, but also by a likeness and example; he convicts 
him by his word and spirit 2c. This is an example of the 
divine good will against those who are justified and still 
have sin left in the flesh 2c. 


V. 6. 3) That he might give shade over his head, and 
deliver him from his evil (ut eriperet eum a malitia 
sua). 

This has a twofold mind. You may judge which of the 


two is the better. God provided a gourd (hederam - 
epheu) that it grew very high, so that its shade would be 
a shelter for the murmur, "that he might have it for 
friends, tabernacles". 


1) In our original: mors inen 6t vitu inou, where the Vulgate offers: 
inolior 68t nnin rnor8 Hnain vitu. - Immediately following, we have 
filled in the gap in the original with the word "wehe". The Weimar 
edition has inserted koronanin instead.

is no doubt that this is a misunderstanding on the part of the scribe.

plague, "that he was so wicked". This malitia is 
explained in two ways: first, that he was afflicted by the 
heat of the sun; second, that God did all this to save him 
from the evil by His example and deed. This was the 
reason that God made the gourd grow, so that he might 
convict him of having acted wickedly, and so that he 
might say of himself that he had acted wickedly. He 
should believe that his indignation was foolish. By this 


example he wanted to cure his murmuring. - [Laetitia] 
Magna, 4) that is, he was very pleased with the epheu 
(hedera); this is a Hebrew way of speaking. Another text 


has cucurbita (pumpkin). Ueber Ein W6rtlein one 
argues fiercely; see the Jerome. These he calls 


pumpkiners (cucurbitarios). It is neither an epheu, nor 
a pumpkin, but a fast growing little tree, similar in leaves 
to the tendrils of the vine 5) and not similar in trunk. It 
gives a dense shade by the height of the leaves. Note 
what Jerome says: This tree is unknown to us, which is 
peculiar to that country. It is neither the Greek nor the 
Latin myrrh, "nor must we have it". 


V. 7. But the Lord provided a worm that stung 2c. 


By this example or event he wanted to refute Jonah's 
displeasure and show it to be unjust. We will leave out 
the Hebrew word, because we have [the thing] 6) in 
Hebrew.

same word used here 2c. [He] "shall faint, pine away" 2c. 
Therefore he wished death to his soul. Now he returns to 
the order of history; you must not think that he spoke this 
twice, but once. 


V. 9. Do you think you are justly angry? 


Now he applies the example and the likeness. The 
prophet is unwilling and grumbles because of the 
salvation of the city. Another evil is added, that the joy is 
gone. Since he is already unwilling, he becomes irritated, 
as sin tends to increase in a sinner. 


V. 10. 2) [And the LORD said, Thou wailest for the 
gourd, in that thou hast not wrought]. 


You man spare; "are merciful" to the gourd. What is he 
compared to Nineveh? "Nor grieveth thee" that the 
worm hath stung him 2c. If a man can be kind against 
temporal things, should not God also spare and have 
mercy 2c.? This is a word of the incomprehensible mercy 
and kindness of the divine majesty. [Matth. 7, 11.: "So 
then you, who are nevertheless bad, can still give good 
gifts to your children" 2c. 


V. 11. who do not know difference what is right or 
left? 


"What is right or left", [for this we say in German:] "what 
is white, what is black", what is this or that 2c., namely, 
what is for the blessedness of the soul. Simply and 
according to the grammar it is said: They are ignorant.

they have not had the word 3). [They have gone astray,] 
since they are human beings, and | should corrupt 
them? If they knew what you know, this would not have 
happened. 

| leave the secret interpretation to you according to 
the Gospel, where Christ Himself condescends to refer 
this prophecy to Himself [Luc. 11, 29. f. Matth. 12, 39.ff. 
16, 4.]. Christ seems to have enjoyed this history. Again 
he states in Matthew [Cap. 12, 41J: "The people of 
Nineveh [will appear at the last judgment with this 
generation, and will condemn it, because they repented 
after the preaching of Jonah, and behold,] here is more 
than Jonah" 2c. 4) Christ was cast ius sea when he 
came into the world; for his sake also the sea is troubled. 
These will [accept him], those will not. He is devoured 
by the whale, that is, by the prince [of this world]. The 
maw that swallows him is death and hell. He who is 
swallowed up on the cross is in the grave for three days, 
but rises again after three days, because he could not 
be held [by death] [Acts 2:24]. The door of death is the 
door to life. The ignominy is a promotion to glory, to 
honor; death to life; the mouth of hell to heaven. The 
mouth of the earth, as was the case with the mouth of 
the whale, is both the door to death and the door to life. 
The rest you may mean for yourselves 2c.

addition is according to the Hall manuscript. 

4) Instead of this saying both editions offer: uouue Ninive plus Nie 
quaru louas ete. Instead of uouue Nineveh we have assumed viri 
Mulvitae according to the Vulgate, and added the saying, which is 
given only after its first and last words. The Hallic manuscript has 
instead, "Likewise, as he says of the repentance of the people of 
Nineveh." 


972 Interpretation of Micah (1.), Dietrich's preface. W. vi, 2700-2702. 973 


K. D, Martin Luther's interpretation of the prophet Micah. 


1, interpretation Who the prophet Micah 


from Luther's lectures compiled by M. Veit Dietrich. *) 


These lectures are finished April 7, 1525; printed 1542. 


Newly translated from the Latin. 


[Veit Dietrich's] preface. 


Veit Dietrich, preacher of the church at For human nature has fallen among the most 


Nuremberg, wishes salvation to the reverend, 
highly learned and godly Mr. Nicolaus Amsdorf, 
bishop of the church at Naumburg in Thuringia. 

As often as I think of the government of the 
Church, I have in mind the exceedingly lovely picture 
with which the Son of God depicts His ministry and 


horrible murderers, by whom it is cruelly wounded 
and robbed. And the priest and the Levite passed by 
the one who was on the way, that is, the nature that 
was overcome by terrible misfortune, that is, the 
teachers of the Mosaic law and human wisdom 
brought no help to the human race. 


His servants, telling the story of the Samaritan who 
himself cares for the man wounded and half-dead by 
the murderers, and brings him to the inn and 
commands that he be cared for [Luc. 10:30 ff]. 


But Christ the stranger comes: he raises the half- 
dead, washes the wounds with wine and pours in the 
most healing oil. And after he has laid the heavy 
burden of our guilt on his body, he brings the sick to 
him. 








*) This interpretation can also be traced back to the lectures Luther gave on the Minor Prophets in the years 1524 to 1526. Materially, 
it is much closer to the Altenburg manuscript than was the case with Dietrich's treatments of the prophets Joel, Amos and Obadiah, but 
formally it deviates much further from it, for this Commentary is almost three times stronger than the aforementioned manuscript; "but it 
becomes so only in that the editor adds long discussions (on the opern eleetiein of the monsedi, polemics against the Pabstthum) similar to 
1536, but even more frequent. Luther's explanations are embellished with classical citations and a wealth of biblical examples. For the real 
textual explanation of Micah, nothing new is added beyond the material offered by the Altenburg manuscript" (Weim. Ausg., vol. XIII, p. XXVI). 
The time when Luther finished the lectures, namely April 7, 1525, is given at the end of the Altenburg manuscript. Before Dietrich submitted 
his edition to the printer, he presented it to Luther for inspection, who also declared himself satisfied with it. Dietrich's preface, in the form of 
a letter to Nicolaus Amsdorf, Bishop of Naumburg, was written by Melanchthon for him, as we can see from a letter from Melanchthon to Veit 
Dietrich (6orp. Rek. IV, 908), dated December 4, 1542. The first edition, which appeared in Wittenberg, has the title: Eornrnentarius in AUeimrn

was published in 1543 in Basel by Bartholomaus Westh, and a third edition in 1546 in Frankfurt. In the collections: in the Latin Wittenberg 
(1552), tom. IV, col. 563d (after the original edition); in the Jena one (1570), tom. IV, col. 5291" (after the Basel edition); and in the Erlanger, 
exe”. opp., torn. XXVI, p. 237. This writing was translated into German by N. Stephan Reich, and appeared in K6nigsberg in 1555 in quarto. 
This translation is included in the Wittenberg edition (1556), vol. VIII, p. 445d; then transferred to the Altenburg, vol. VIII, p. 67; to the Leipzig, 
vol. VIII, p. 348 and Walch, vol. VI, 2700. Dietrich's preface is found only in the Latin Wittenberg edition. It was translated into German only 
for the Leipzig edition by A. |. |. Greifs for the Leipzig edition and then included by Walch. We present a new translation of this preface 
according to the Wittenberg edition, and of the text itself according to the Erlangen edition, which reproduces the original print, comparing the 
Wittenberg and Jena editions.

into the inn, that is, into the church, and commands 
the household, that is, the teachers of the Gospel, to 
take care of the healing. What can be thought more 
lovely than to contemplate the benevolence of the 
Son of God towards the human race, expressed in 
this image? 

But again, when I turn my eyes to the inn and see 
that everything is full of terrible diseases, and the 
cure is difficult and dangerous, the doctors quite 
unequal: then I truly tremble in my whole body. Of 
such a nature have we, who are now teaching the 
churches, delivered Germany to be healed, which 
truly suffers from the most dreadful diseases. 

For, to say nothing of the vices of individual 
people, how great are the obstacles to healing: the 
tyranny of those who are hostile to the Gospel; the 
epicuric contempt of the true religion among the 
people; the false accusations of godless teachers, as 
of Eck, Pyghius and similar people, who scare the 
hearts of the inexperienced away from the pure 
doctrine; the courageous will of good heads in the 
clergy, who do not cease to cloud the clear springs of 
the Gospel, which resounds in our churches. 
Meanwhile, we are in truth, as Christ says, a small 
flock; what can we do in healing, that is, with 
exhortation and teaching? If we consult human 
reasoning, we few, despised and weak people cannot 
resist the rage of so many. 

But I am strengthened in our ministry by the Son 
of God, who has almost always ruled this His shelter 
in the same way through the weak. "God chose," as 
St. Paul [1 Cor. 1, 27.] says, "what is weak in the 
sight of the world, that He might put to shame what 
is strong." Therefore, we are not to leave our post. 
For the Son of God Himself also promises that He will 
stand by us. He says [Matth. 28, 20.]: "Iam with you 
until the end of the world." 

But still, some times are happier and calmer than 
others. At times the world has had godly princes who 
helped to spread the right doctrine, as Constantinus 
and Theodosius. Now not only the barbarian Turk is 
waging war against the name of Christ, but also many 
kings, pretending to be Christians, are raging against 
Christ's members, seeking to suppress and extinguish 
the pure light of the Gospel. 

In ancient times, the bishops were the leaders of 
the rest of the preachers, who by their erudition and 
prestige ensured the unity of the people.

of those who taught rightly. Now the bishops, who 
are satellites of the Roman pope, not only do not help 
to take care of the godly in the inn of Christ, but they 
themselves practice robbery, defend the most 
shameful and obviously blasphemous errors, the 
idolatries that are practiced in the invocation of the 
saints and in the desecration of the Holy Communion, 
excessive debauchery and many _ obviously 
nonsensical things, and kill the godly who teach 
better. 

This is not concealed and cannot be excused in 
any way by honorable people, unless the 
unreasonable reason is given that it is not proper for 
wise and worldly-wise people to start quarrels with 
their fellow citizens and to deviate from what the 
powerful generally agree on. This worldly wisdom 
may have its place elsewhere, but it cannot 
strengthen blasphemous errors. For we have another 
rule in the church which commands this [Gal. 1:8]: 
"If an angel from heaven preaches a different gospel, 
let him be accursed. Let him be forsaken and 
accursed, and let him flee away, as the scum that 
defends idolatries, and makes war against the first 
commandment, "I am the LORD thy God, which 
brought thee out of the land of Egypt." 

Therefore, we should not only abandon such 
bishops, the enemies of Christ, but also curse them 
as evil-doers, tainted with idolatry and murder of the 
godly. But if there are some in this crowd who want 
to be healed, we exhort them to separate themselves 
from the opinions and advice of others and to begin 
to give glory to Christ and to care for their salvation 
and that of the churches. Would God that godly 
princes would also purify the monasteries and 
appoint capable bishops over them. For this service 
they undoubtedly owe to God, as it is written [Ps. 24, 
7. Vulg.]: "You princes, open your gates wide and the 
doors of the world high, so that the King of honor 
may enter." 

Since I had heard that you, venerable bishop, had 
been commanded to hold this office of government, 
which you now administer, I could not but approve of 
this example. I know that you are far from ambition, 
and that both out of a natural disposition for restraint 
and because you are already tired through old age 
and hard work, you love peace and quiet, and 
because of your own you are more likely to give way 
to others than to quarrel with anyone.

This too, that you have taken upon yourself a 
burdensome burden and spitefulness. But I praise 
your heart that you have decided for the sake of the 
church to undergo these difficulties rather than to 
concede this position to another who is an enemy of 
the pure teaching of the gospel. If the other princes 
want to advise their churches in truth, they will 
eventually have to follow this example. 

For in what your adversaries bring forward of the 
canonical election, they do deceitfulness with words. 
For so many centuries there has been no canonical 
election, but these benefices have passed from hand 
to hand either by the candidacy of princes or by the 
collaboration of powerful people, or have been 
bought at Rome, with contemptuous setting aside of 
the old and new canons. But no consideration at all 
was given to Christian doctrine and to the 
government, which actually belongs to the church. 
What I am telling you here is so obvious that no one, 
no matter how incomprehensible and impudent he 
may be, can deny it. Would that God would restore 
to the churches the canonical right to vote, which 
belongs not only to one class, but to the learned, 
honorable and godly people of all classes. 

Now the churches are oppressed by the 
foundations through tyranny. Even though there are 
some good men in them, they are surpassed in 
number and audacity by the wicked. Therefore, the 
other estates should assist the good, so that the glory 
of Christ might be promoted and the salvation of men 
advised. But wisdom is set aside, and violence is 
used, especially in this trade. 

The adversaries evidently see that in what 
concerns election they obey neither old nor new laws, 
but are determined to retain by force the possession 
of power and good life, seeing that they would be 
thrust out of the same if they were bound by the old 
laws of election. 

I am often displeased that we are accused of 
disregarding the canons, since we follow the 
prescriptions of the ancient and useful canons more 
than the adversaries. They set divine and human 
laws according to their arbitrariness and abolish them 
again. Yes, as it is said of Solon's tables of laws in the 


Athenian Comedy, ppyuual yayypuc Taig yoppyor 
they roast flour with the tables of laws lighted. Thus 
our adversaries before this time have most brazenly 
destroyed the monuments of right ecclesiastical 
antiquity. Where are the ancient writers who were 


has entrusted to the monasteries for preservation? 
What can be more dissimilar than the old 
monasteries, which consisted of learned and godly 
people, and the present cooperatives of knights, who 
now hold wild revelries in the most prestigious 
monasteries. 

That you are now commanded to govern there, I 
believe that you have acted godly and rightly in it, 
and I ask God to give your advice success in all the 
improvements you intend to make. Visitations will 
have to be made in the neighboring churches, godly 
and learned pastors will have to be procured, courts 
will have to be established, discipline will have to be 
introduced, scientific studies will have to be 
promoted, and poor students will have to be 
supported. I know that you lack neither good counsel 
nor the will to carry this out. Therefore, I ask that 
God promote your very laudable efforts. 

But it is useful for the churches that we, who teach 
the gospel, bear witness to the people of our 
agreement; therefore I have now gladly written to 
you to declare that I am united with your church in 
mind, heart and will. 

Then, because I have always loved you for your 
righteousness and for your skill in judgment, I have 
wanted to indicate my constant devotion to you 
through this preface, and to publish the lectures 
(dictata) on the prophet Micah by the highly famous 
and excellent man D. Martin Luther, our teacher, 
whom I rightly honor as a father, under the prefix of 
your name. However, I have sent them to him 
beforehand for his perusal. For I believe that these 
interpretations will also be useful for the church's 
descendants, because he has such skill in interpreting 
the prophets that we cannot prefer anyone else to 
him in this respect. 

I believe that this praise will also be granted to him 
by the more reasonable opponents. But however the 
adversaries or disfavored people may judge him, I 
thank God that He has called me to the knowledge of 
the Gospel and has given me the opportunity not only 
to hear Luther's living voice, but also to gain an 
insight into his inner life through the contact with him 
in his domestic life, which is full of godliness and the 
most glorious examples of an honorable way of life. 
And in truth and from the bottom of my heart, I 
would like to wish all his enemies that they would 
gain as thorough an insight into Luther's life as is 
known to me.

Basil wishes himself luck to the instruction of his 

nourisher, who had heard Gregory of NeoCaesarea. 
He also says somewhere that the voice of Athanasius| 
is still ringing in his ears. So I have no doubt that you 
and many others also rejoice that they have heard 
Luther and acknowledge that they have progressed 
through his teaching. I know that Erasmus, although 
he seemed to be very estranged from him, sometimes 
angrily said to someone who rebuked Luther: one 
should not 'blame this man, who in his interpretations| 
on. He said that one should not blame this man, who 
in his interpretations on one side brought more 
thorough scholarship and more light into the 
teachings of the prophets and apostles than the 
interpretations of anyone else at any time.

sometimes reproached by ill-wishers that we were not

We do not want to accept the truth that our churches 
profess, but rather, in a kind of flattery, we ascribe 
too much to Luther. This is a great presumption, if 
they think that we all have not heard Luther other 
than as it is said in the fable of the donkey: 

ovw TI¢ pov EAEYVE, OOE TA, WTA EXIVEI 
someone told a fable to the donkey; but he shook his 
ears]. 

But these slanders will be refuted by time itself. I 
do not doubt that the doctrine which our churches 
profess is the true voice of the Gospel, and in truth 
the opinion of the whole (catholicae) holy Church of 
Christ, which is necessary for the right invocation of 
God and the blessedness of men. Therefore, I insist 
on this opinion, and I wish to encourage others to 
the same, as much as I can, for the sake of the glory 
of God and the blessedness of men. Be well. 

Nuremberg, in 1542. 


[D. Martin Luther's Preface to the Prophet Micah. 


Since the desolation of the kingdoms of Israel and 
Judah was imminent, many prophets were sent by the 
Lord to proclaim this disaster beforehand and to exhort 
the people to repentance, so that at least some of them 
would convert and be preserved in this miserable future 
destruction of the people. The desolation of the kingdom 
of Israel fell in the sixth year of Hezekiah, for that is the 
ninth of sKing* Hosea [2 Kings 17:6.]. About one 
hundred and fifty years after that the kingdom of Judah 
was destroyed by the Babylonians, the city laid waste 
and the temple burned. 

This calamity was first prophesied by Amos, who 
lived under Uzziah the father of Jotham. Hosea followed 
him and lived under Uzziah, Jotham and Ahaz. Isaiah 
was in office for a longer time, for he also lived under 
Hezekiah. But Micah, the youngest of these, was not yet 
in office at the time of Uzziah. These prophets have 
completely one and the same way of teaching, because 
they preach about the desolation of the people and the 
abolition of the physical kingdom for the sake of sins, so 
that another, new and spiritual kingdom might be 
established through Christ. 


The first part of the teaching belongs to the penance. 
The last is for the comfort of the godly, who, having 
suffered the same calamity, needed this spiritual comfort 
from the kingdom of Christ, through which they believed 
they would be in grace; for it is a kingdom of forgiveness 
of sins, of righteousness, and of eternal life. And since 
for the sake of this spiritual kingdom both kingdoms, 
Judah and Israel, were desolate, and the people 
scattered among the Gentiles, a remnant was 
preserved, that the promise of Christ might be sure, and 
the people sure, out of whom Christ should be born. This 
is the subject of the four prophets mentioned, one as 
well as the other, calling the people to repentance and 
comforting the godly, whom the common calamity also 
affected. 

And here we are rightly reminded of the counsel of 
God, who always, when very great changes and 
exceedingly unfortunate times are imminent, used to 
remind people beforehand by the Word. Thus Noah 
preached a hundred and twenty years before the Flood, 
so that some would mend their ways and be saved. 
Before the last destruction

the synagogue, John, Christ and the apostles preached 
for more than forty years. And there is no doubt that the 
light of the Word that we have today will be followed by 
a certain calamity. For in addition to the other sins, there 
is also this, that the Word is neglected and despised by 
those who hear it and have it. The others who do not 
have it, as there are the pope, the bishops and many 
furious princes, persecute the word with the greatest 
cruelty. Do you think that God can see this and tolerate 
it longer? Since Germany is now ripe to suffer the 
punishments it deserves, we are reminded by the Word, 
so that at least some will mend their ways and either be 
saved in the coming calamity, or have something with 
which to comfort themselves in the common misfortune. 

And it could almost seem as if the Jews had reason 
why they did not believe the preaching of the prophets. 
For there were the promises of the everlasting kingdom 
of David. Likewise, that the scepter should not be taken 
away from the tribe of Judah until the Messiah came. 
Against these promises the sermons of the prophets 
seemed to argue. Therefore, there was no lack of people 
who accused them as if they were lying spirits, as the 
examples of Jeremiah and others testify. And puffed up 
by the promises, which they had not rightly understood, 
they laughed at and despised the true prophets, as the 
papists do now, because they dream that they are the 
church, lean on the promises given to the church, and 
live quite securely. 

And GOD with wonderful wisdom did both, that the 
threats of the prophets were not in vain, and yet also the 
promises were fulfilled. The people were led away 
captive, and yet there remained a light from the house 
of David, the captive Jehoiachin, who was delivered 
from the dungeon by EvilMerodach and kept royal [2 
Kings 25:27]. Then it came to pass that the remnant of 
the people were restored, by whom the city and the 
temple were restored. 

Reason does not understand this way in which GOD 
fulfills His promises, for 





she thinks that God cares about the great number, and 
as she is ambitious, she thinks that God, for the sake of 
His glory, is doing everything magnificently. But GOD 
does not look at the great number; rather, for the sake of 
sin, He rejects a tremendously great multitude, so that 
He may keep His promises to a few believers. 

In this way St. Paul discusses that God has not 
rejected His people, "for", he says [Rom. 11, 1.], "| am 
also an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham". This is 
admittedly a great thing, that he boasts this of his 
individual person, and yet meanwhile confesses that the 
whole people were cast out and rejected. But this is the 
way God acts, as Isaiah [Cap. 10, 22] testifies: "For 
though thy people, O Israel, be as the sand of the sea, 
yet shall the remnant of them be converted." The godless 
crowd of the Jews did not recognize this, therefore they 
surely despised the threats of the prophets and thought 
that God would not reject such a large number. 

The papists do not have such a promise, and yet they 
boast that God will not abandon His Church. This is true, 
of course, but how do they want to prove that they are 
the Church? By standing in the highest dignity? By 
having the greater multitude on their side? But God does 
not look at the dignity, not at the great number, as the 
history of the Jews testifies. Therefore, they should 
abandon this security and humble themselves before 
God, since He could preserve His Church even if there 
were no pope, no bishop. Thus, after almost the entire 
kingdom of Judah and all that was high in the nation had 
been destroyed, he nevertheless received the tribe from 
which Christ was born, like an earlobe of a lamb torn out 
of the jaws of a wolf, as the prophet [Amos 3:12] speaks. 
For God is wont to act so marvelously that the wicked 
become ashamed and ashes and perish. 

And this is also the reason why the prophets have 
veiled the future things in such a way that they seem to 
be in contradiction with themselves. The passage about 
the king Zedekiah gives a clear proof of this. Jeremiah 


982 L. XXVI, 249-251. interpretations on the prophets. W. 


says of him “Cap. 32, 4.], "He shall speak orally with ihin 
seeming king of Babels, and shall see him with his 
eyes." But Ezekiel says in the twelfth chapter [v. 12.], 
"His face shall be veiled, that he shall not see the land 
with any eye." Such contradictions the wicked have 
taken very fine notice of, and have reproached the 
prophets with them as certain proofs of falsehood. And 
yet it is true what 





VI, 2717-2721. 983 


This is what Ezekiel said, because Zedekiah's eyes 
were put out and he could not see the land of Babylon, 
yet he saw the eyes of the king. This gave offense to the 
wicked, so that they suspected that the prophets had 
lied, but God uses this way to punish presumption with 
blindness. This is what | wanted to say in a few words 
about the content of this prophet. 


The first chapter. 


V. 1. This is the word of the Lord that came to Micah 
from Mareshah in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, Jehizkiah, 
kings of Judah, which he saw over Samaria and 
Jerusalem. 


The word xxx is a familiar expression. It is properly 
translated by "word," but it has a broader meaning 
among the Hebrews than among us, for it signifies the 
whole matter acted or said about, roughly as we use the 


word "commerce" (eS). 

However, he only remembers the kings of Judah in 
the title, since he also preaches about the disturbance 
1) of the kingdom of Israel. Perhaps because he 
prophesied only in the kingdom of Judah. Amos and 
Hosea also mention the kings of Israel. 


The prophet is called Morasthites from his fatherland 
Maresa, a city of Judah, as can be seen from Joshua 
Cap. 15, 44. and 2 Chron. 11,2) 8. 

But he commemorates three kings. Jotham reigned 
sixteen years. His son Ahaz reigned for the same length 
of time. Jehizkiah reigned twenty-nine years. This 
calculation shows that Micah not only lived a long time 
in his office, but also did not complete this prophecy in 
one sermon nor in one year. Therefore, as we have 
divided the prophet Amos and the others into certain 
sermons above, so also Micah must be divided into 
several sermons. And this 


1) Erlanger: asvastations instead of: as Variation". 
2) In the Latin editions: 1 car. 16. 


is also the reason why Lucas [Cap.3, 4.] 3) calls the 
prophecy of Isaiah a "book of speeches". Because he 
indicates that all this is not, as it seems to us, treated 
and completed at one time and in one speech, but at 
different times. 

But this serves to make us suffer with equanimity the 
contempt for the word and the persecution that we 
experience everywhere today, since the holy prophets 
endured the same misfortune with untiring zeal and 
unbowed courage for many years, and that among a 
stiff-necked and hard people, and therefore did not 
abandon their profession. So too we often remember it, 
when our hearts are moved by the unseemly treatment 
and become despondent to leave the preaching ministry 
and seek good days. 

But that he adds that the word of the Lord was done 
against Samaria and Jerusalem, he first of all incurs 
great envy and hatred, because he connects Jerusalem 
with Samaria, since in Jerusalem there was the right 
worship and the right preaching ministry, but in Samaria 
neither, but everything was full of idolatry and godless 
teaching. So it would seem unseemly if someone were 
to say that those who confess the gospel are in the same 
condemnation with God as the papists, and must suffer 
the same punishments and the same judgment. This 
would seem improper, and yet it is true that God does 
not punish the sins of the papists.

| hate them equally, whether they are committed by us 
or by the adversaries. Yes, the servant who knows the 
will of God and does not do it, will have to suffer all the 
more strokes, as Christ indicates in the Gospel [Luc. 12, 
47]. 

But the judgment of the people does not move the 
prophet; he says freely what the matter is and is not 
moved by his danger. That is why the elders of the 
people [Jer. 26, 17-19], who wanted to save Jeremiah 
from undeserved death, use this example of Micah 
against the angry priests who wanted Jeremiah dead, 
and they praise the godliness of Hezekiah who had 
preserved the prophet who prophesied so vehemently 
against Jerusalem. But this passage of Jeremiah shows 
sufficiently that if it had not been for the good king, Micah 
would have had to die because of these prophecies 
against the holy city of Jerusalem. 


V. 2. Hear, all peoples, take heed, land, and all that 
is within; for GOD the LORD has to speak to you, even 
the LORD out of His holy temple. 


This is an extremely appropriate beginning for the 
subject, because, seeing that such a terrible devastation 
is certainly imminent, he seeks with a great spirit and 
with great vehemence to awaken the people who are, as 
it were, drowsy in their sins, so that they may take care 
to amend their lives and avert the punishment. For this 
is the first thing that the prophets used to do, and Christ 
also wanted this order to be observed in the New 
Testament when teaching, that first the doctrine of 
repentance should be presented, which leads man to the 
knowledge of sin, so that we not only confess that we are 
sinners, but also begin to hate sin in truth, because of 
the greatness of the wrath of God that it brings upon us. 
Isaiah also uses a similar beginning. But both seem to 
have followed Moses, Deut. 32, 1. For although the 
prophets preach only to the one Jewish people, the 
majesty of the Word is so great that all that is in all 
creation should rightly hold the Word in honor. And this 
example goes to all of us 





that we learn to fear God and refrain from sinning, since 
He has punished the sin of His people so severely. 

But that he adds: "God the Lord has to speak with 
you" is similar to what we see in the letters of the 
apostles, where they proclaim that they are servants of 
Jesus Christ according to the will of God. For Micah does 
not want his teaching to be accepted as his teaching, but 
as that of GOD. Therefore he says that he calls God, the 
Lord, to witness, that he does not speak anything 
according to his own will, but everything from God's 
revelation and command, so that the opinion is: Hear 
me, you nations, because if you hear me, you hear the 
Lord Himself. This one you will certainly not reject as a 
witness of my prophecy without the highest danger for 
you. Thus, in his prayer, Moses, out of reverence for the 
Word [Ps. 90:1], calls himself a "man of God," that is, 
whom God commanded and sent to reveal the will of 
God through the Law. 

But what is the purpose of the repetition with the 
mention of the place: "The LORD from his holy temple"? 
He adds this not only for the sake of describing the true 
God by a certain and true sign, namely as the one who 
promised in his word that he would dwell in the temple at 
Jerusalem, but also to punish the godless presumption, 
because the kingdom of Judah kept the right worship in 
the rightful place. But since the prophet had connected 
Jerusalem with Samaria and threatened it with the same 
punishment, those who were in the kingdom of Judah 
considered themselves much more holy, because the 
kingdom of Israel practiced open idolatry. This 
presumption the prophet meets by this repetition. As if 
he wanted to say: You are presumptuous because of 
your worship and your sacrifices, you boast about the 
temple, you boast that the Lord is the inhabitant of the 
temple; but he, the Lord himself, will testify about his 
dwelling place against you. For though you have the 
lawful sacrifices in the lawful place, yet you do not 
perform them in the right way. For you should have 
trusted in the Lord's mercy, but you trust in the temple 
and in the Lord.

your sacrifices. You should have obeyed this merciful 
and kind Lord from your heart and done _ his 
commandments. But you let them stand and live in your 
own ways, as Isaiah says [Cap. 53, 6. 55, 7. -56, 11.], let 
your lusts run wild and do everything you like without fear 
of God. This testimony of your ungodliness is given by 
the Lord Himself against you from His temple, of which 
you are very proud. But as this place is very holy, 
because of its holy inhabitant, so it is desecrated by you, 
who are unholy. 

| think that in this way the prophet is here covertly 
punishing the confidence that the Jews in truth placed 
more in the temple and in their worship than in God. But 
it can also be referred to the fact that, as we will show 
later, under Ahab the temple was closed and all corners 
were full of high places. As if he wanted to say: You are 
leaving the temple, which the LORD has appointed for 
His worship, but He will not suffer Him to be despised; 
from the temple itself He will act against you. 


V. 3 For behold, the LORD will go out of his place, 
and come down, and tread upon the high places of the 
land. 


Here he begins to threaten the future misfortune, or 
rather the disturbance. As if he wanted to say: Do not be 
sure. You invent that God is merciful to you, or at least 
that he does not see your sins and does not want to 
punish you; you think that he snores idly, that he does 
not pay attention to your transgressions. Truly he is 
already stirring to go out and visit you; he will soon come 
and descend, that is, he will show by deed that he is 
present and angry with your wickedness, that he will 
punish it through the Assyrian and Babylonian. 

But the Scriptures use this simile of going out and 
coming down to indicate that God, though slow to 
avenge, will certainly avenge all that there is of 
ungodliness and infamy. Thus the poets have also 
invented that the gods put on woolen socks when they 
want to execute punishments. For the wicked will be 
assailed by the wrath of God, as experience has taught 
the pagans. 





The Hebrew word which the Latin interpreter translated 
by excelsa ["heights"] is often used for altars or 
elevations, which we also call altars (altaria) in Latin, 


from the height (ab altitudine), or that which is erected 
in an elevated place above the earth. But in general it 
denotes everything that is sublime or outstanding. 
Therefore | think it is taken generally in this passage, 
"The LORD will tread upon the high places of the earth," 
that is, that which is high among you, and that which is 
prominent above others, namely, the kings, princes, 
priests, the worship, yea, even the temple itself, the 
LORD will tread down, and make it nothing. Therefore, 
this is, as it were, the content and short epitome of the 
whole prophecy, which he will present later in various 
ways. 


V. 4, that the mountains will melt beneath him, and 
the valleys will crack; as wax melts before the fire, as 
the waters that flow beneath. 


This is a synecdoche, because he takes what is 
contained there for what is contained in it. 1) For by the 
expression "mountains and valleys" he understands the 
whole people, that everything is to be disturbed which is 
situated both in the mountains and in the valleys. For he 
alludes to the location of the holy land, which is full of 
mountains and valleys, to indicate the utmost desolation, 
lest it be thought that anything will be left anywhere on 
which the enemy has not laid his hand. 

The parables used by the prophet serve to show that this 
wrath of the Lord cannot be restrained or prevented in 
any way. For what is there that can keep the wax from 
melting when it is brought to the fire? What can resist the 
onrush of a torrent that rushes down on sudden places? 
Likewise, he says, it will be with the punishment that 
comes upon you with great impetuosity. The Lord is the 
fire, you are softer than any wax. The Lord is the torrent, 
which flows with great

love, he does not at all see in his mind that he would 
almost fall into despair, which he felt when he was 
admonished by the prophet Nathan. How much less 
could he think at that time of the frightful uproar which 
was afterwards aroused by his son; of the desecration of 
the concubines by him;] of the multiple murder to which 
the uproar gave occasion. Of all these things the 
Scripture indicates that they were the punishments of 
that sin. For Satan keeps the heart, which is occupied 
with thoughts of sin, so entangled that it cannot foresee 
anything, cannot consider anything accurately. 
Therefore, this sermon is necessary to admonish us 
that God is determined to punish our sins, and not to turn 
a blind eye to them or to punish them lightly, but that His

excellent certainty of faith, that he accuses the people of 
godlessness, who seemed to be the holiest in the whole 
world. And truly, we cannot compare our monks and 
hypocrites in any way with the Jews. For the Jews had to 
do with the services which God had instituted and 
commanded, but the religion of the monks is nothing but 
a self-chosen spirituality, as St. Paul calls it [Col. 2, 18.], 
that is, services which they have chosen for themselves 
without the Word, without God's command, according to 
their own will, with respect to which they can never be sure 
that they please God and are approved by Him. Since our. th is immeasurable, so that we, thus reminded, may

He says, "No one can make me confess my sins; you also 
boast about your transgressions as if they were 
righteousness. So that you may know what the Lord is 
punishing and why he is threatening you with such great 
misfortune: the kingdom of Israel sins in Samaria by 
sacrificing there and worshipping against the 
commandment of God; but the kingdom of Judah sins in 
Jerusalem precisely because it thinks it serves God and 
is well deserving of him. 

Furthermore, | have said above that the prophets had 
obvious cause why they condemned the worship 
services that were established in the kingdom of Samaria 
or Israel. For since God had chosen Jerusalem in which 
the sacrifices were to take place in the Temple that God 
had commanded to be built, it was idolatry for Jeroboam 
to decree places of worship in Israel, for he did it without 
the Word, even against the Word of God. 

And here the foolishness and the error of human 
wisdom is illustrated very well. Jeroboam thought that if 
he established special religious services in his kingdom 
and prevented his subjects from performing the annual 
religious services in Jerusalem, he would fortify his 
kingdom and break the power of the kingdom of Judah. 
But it turned out quite differently, for by this very counsel 
he overthrew his kingdom by means of idolatry, so that 
it was devastated by the Gentiles. 

It is almost the same thing that happens to many 
princes and kings today. They worship the Roman whore 
and favor and protect the godless church services, they 
make sure that nothing is changed either in the doctrine 
or in the ceremonies, and think that they will be safe in 
this way, and thus their own can be preserved. But just in 
this way they will bring themselves and theirs to ruin. For 
God will not let the contempt of His word and idolatry go 
unpunished forever. 

Therefore, although the kingdom of Israel stubbornly 
held fast to its worship, saying that it did not worship idols 
but the true God, it was not so much the place that 
mattered; God looked at the heart, not the place, not the 
persons; it did not matter whether the sacrifices were 
performed in Jerusalem or in other places; even the 
preliminaries of the sacrifices were not the same. 





Jerusalem was a city of the Gentiles, so how could it be 
better than other places? Although this and similar things 
were said by the false prophets in defense of idolatry 
against the prophets, they could not deny idolatry. For 
we are not allowed to worship either. And if we do 
something according to our own will, how can hearts be 
sure that it pleases God? Therefore, because not only 
the place, not only the persons, but the whole way of 
worship was prescribed by God, the prophets could 
easily convict the kingdom of Israel of idolatry. For when 
it comes to the service of GOD, it is not what you do, but 
how you do it. They sacrificed oxen, bowl and grain 
offerings in the kingdom of Israel at certain hours and 
days, as was the custom in the kingdom of Judah and in 
Jerusalem. Therefore, although there was no difference 
in the work itself, there was a difference in that God had 
commanded that this work be done in a different place 
and by different people. 

Therefore, the sacrifices of the kingdom of Israel 
were connected with a _ disrespect of God's 
commandment and a disobedience against the word. 
But God, as Samuel [1 Sam. 15, 22] says, wants 
obedience to His word rather than burnt offerings and 
the fat of rams. But if anyone does not obey the voice of 
GOD, he is said to be an idolater-though he praises the 
highest and most difficult services of God. Thus it is 
peculiar to idolaters that they do not choose things that 
appear to be easy, but things that are arduous and very 
difficult. 

Therefore also our monks, the devil's own servants, 
flee the ordinary things, the government of the 
household, the marriage state and the other offices, 
which are necessary for the civil life; they do not use 
ordinary clothes, not ordinary food, but choose such 
things, which have more admiration because of their 
rarity, as the priests of Baal wounded their skin and shed 
their blood. Even the kings among the people of God 
slaughtered and burned after Abra-.

993 





Ham's example their children. But since God demands 
above all things that one obey His voice, it is obvious 
that there is idolatry where this obedience is not. 

But, you will say, it was not so in the kingdom of 
Judah. For these kept the ordinary services in the place 
which God had appointed for it, and by the persons 
appointed by God. Why then does the prophet say that 
the high places of Judah were Jerusalem itself? This city 
was the crown of the whole kingdom for this reason, 
because it was ordained by God Himself for worship. 

Here we must first remember the title. For the 
prophet says that he lived and preached under Ahaz, 
the son of Jotham. But the histories show that King Ahaz 
departed from the way of his father and followed the way 
of the kingdom of Israel. For he also made images of the 
idols of Baal and worshipped them, and sacrificed his 
son in the valley of Hinnom, even sacrificing on all the 
high places. Since God punished this idolatry in many 
ways, by the king of Assyria, by the king of Israel, by the 
Edomites, he nevertheless did not become better by it 
alone, but did over it still heavier sins: he closed the 
temple, which was intended by God for the service of 
God, and established altars in all corners of Jerusalem, 
on which he ordered to offer sacrifices to other gods. In 
the other cities of Judah, too, he had high places erected 
and offerings made to foreign gods. Therefore, 
according to the letter, "the high places of Judah" are 
rightly interpreted as Jerusalem itself, in which the 
godless king established his godless being and 
idolatries of every kind, from where afterwards the 
example spread to the whole empire. 

But you can find elsewhere that even the services 
which were performed in a lawful manner in the temple 
itself by the lawful persons are punished, as in the 50th 
Psalm, v. 8, and in Isaiah in the first chapter, v. 11, 
where God says badly of the sacrifices themselves that 
he has no desire for them and does not demand them, 
even though they were not performed in an unseemly 
place, not even by unlawful persons, as in the kingdom 
of Israel. 

But it shows the prophets, if on these 


The way in which the sacrifices are punished is enough 
to show what is wrong with them. Isaiah complains that 
those who sacrificed the most live in obvious shameful 
deeds by oppressing the poor through stinginess, not 
administering justice properly, neglecting orphans and 
widows, just as the 50th Psalm, v. 17 f., complains that 
they hate discipline, throw the word of the Lord behind 
them, run with thieves, that is, deceive others in their 
dealings and pursue adultery 2c. Those who do these 
things, and then think to make themselves pleasing by 
sacrifice, are they not justly censured? 

Therefore the Lord also says in Hosea in the sixth 
chapter, v. 6, that he is more pleased with mercy than 
with sacrifice. And this saying is quoted by Christ quite 
appropriately [Matth. 9, 13. 12, 7.] against the saints of 
works and Pharisees, who held the highest works of love 
in low esteem compared to their righteousness. 
Therefore, the sacrifices, which are good and holy in 
themselves, are defiled by unholy people, who not only 
offer them without faith, but also with an evil conscience, 
without fear of God and from a heart that is not only 
unrepentant, but even seeks and hopes for 
righteousness through such works. 

Second, such sacrifices are also reprehensible for 
the sake of overturning the order that God Himself 
wanted in the divine services. For some services are 
external, as there are the sacrifices and ceremonies that 
God has instituted, as well as all the good works that 
God has commanded. Others are spiritual, which belong 
to the first table, as there are faith, the fear of God, 
calling, hope, thanksgiving, confession 2c. But the 
outward services are also pleasing to God, because they 
are done in obedience to the Word, if they are connected 
with the inward ones. 

But the hypocrites leave the true worship that is in the 
heart, imitate only the outward worship, and are 
presumptuous of it, as if it were a righteousness in itself, 
even though the hearts are without faith and fear of God, 
even though they do not call upon God in peril, but seek 
other help. Thus did Ahaz; he forsook the true God and 
his worship and went to

For Samaria was the permanent seat of the kings after 
that, and Ahab, the son of Amri, established a Baal 
service there. Therefore the prophets, when they want to 
indicate the head of the sins, use to call Samaria in 
general. And elsewhere they refer to the whole kingdom 
by this name, but here the prophet is actually talking 
about the city. Since this city was very strong and well 
provided with all means of support, and yet, as the 
prophet threatens here, was to suffer the punishment for 
its sins, it can easily be assumed that the other cities 
were also to suffer the same misfortune. 

Here, too, the prophet uses a splendid simile to 
illustrate the future disturbance. The flourishing kingdom 
or city is rightly compared to a well-cultivated field or 
garden, where there is not only a peculiar loveliness, but 
also a joyful abundance of fruits of every kind, which also 
tends to make a pleasant impression through order. For 
disorder is unpleasant where each individual is not in its 
proper place. 

The prophet has this in mind and threatens that it will 
happen that Samaria will have a different appearance, 
namely, such as heaps of stones have, which, when 
diligent farmers plant vines, are gathered from the 
vineyard to one place. But how, you will say, will this be 
done? So that the enemies drag his stones, that is, his 
magnificent buildings and porticoes, and turn them 
upside down from the ground; this | consider to be the 
true opinion. Some interpret what he says about planting 
the vineyard in such a way that it is to be made a 
desolate field on which the cultivators will plant vineyards 
afterwards. 


V. 7. all their idols shall be broken, and all their 
whoredoms shall be burned with fire, and | will destroy 
all their images; for they are gathered of whoredoms, 
and shall become whoredoms again. 

What great thing is it, you say, to threaten the 
destruction of the images and the idols? Who should 
wish that these remained unharmed, when the people 
are led away and 





devastate the kingdom? Does God take pleasure in 
raging against wood and stones, which are God's 
creatures and cannot sin, even though they can be 
misused by men for ungodliness and offense? 

But this threat, like the rest, belongs to the sermon of 
repentance, that men should give up the trust they had 
placed in dead wood and stones and in the worship 
services they had invented, since it was certain that they 
would become a prey of the enemy and could not free 
themselves from the fire and the enemy's violence. 

As for the grammar, xxx is called the carved images; let's 


call temple gifts (donaria). But it is the same word which 
we translated afterwards by "wages". But it means here 
"harlot's wages," that is, which the impious priests 
received by idolatry. Thus we have seen that in the 
places where certain idols were worshipped, a great 
quantity of gifts or temple treasures were offered daily, 
as there were the idols of Mary at Aachen, at 
Regensburg, in Grimmethal, and innumerable others 
throughout the whole kingdom of Pabst, from which the 
idolaters derived exceedingly rich revenues by inventing 
lying miracles. 

XXX we translate by idols, because the Scripture often 
calls them so from the word XXX, which actually means 
to be afflicted. Not only because certain misfortune 
always follows godlessness, as all examples of all times 
testify, but also because there is nothing more 
troublesome and arduous than the life of the idolatrous; 
as our monks serve as an example, to whom some new 
worship was born every day, to whom superstition, 
extending into infinity, laid out new troubles every day. 
Furthermore, this passage is one of the number of those 
which today have given cause to the iconoclasts to throw 
all images out of the churches without distinction. And 
this is not a new noise in the Church. The second synod 
at Nicaea, more than eleven hundred years ago, 1) was 
held under Constantius and his 


1) This is erroneous. The second synod at Nicaea was in 787. 


998 L. XXVI, 267-269. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2745-2748. 


999 





Mother Irene was called together for this reason alone, 
and it was decided with great unanimity against those 
who advocated that no images should be used in the 
churches. Therefore it is not inadmissible to show in a 
few words what is to be held as right in this matter. 

It is true that Moses and the prophets with great zeal 
everywhere forbid and condemn the images, but it is 
inconsistent to understand this in general of all images. 
For the Jews also used images even in the temple, as 
Solomon's building shows. And who should doubt that 
there were not also some painted pictures in the houses 
of the kings and princes? For because painting depicts 
things, it has never been counted among the forbidden 
or illicit arts. Therefore, just as the story of Solomon 
wisely judging between the two harlots is told without 
sin, so the same story can truly be painted without sin. 
And | would not think that the Jews were ever such an 
immoral people that they should not also have had in 
public places, and not only in their private dwellings, 
these memories of outstanding events on paintings, as 
they were very careful in describing them. 

We would therefore consider it not only a cruelty, but 
also an extraordinary ignorance, that in many places 
also the images of Christ and the apostles have been 
thrown out of the churches without any distinction. For 
who does not see that, just as godly histories are told 
without sin even for the benefit of the listeners, such 
histories can also be painted and carved in this way for 
the sake of the unintelligent, not only in private houses, 
but also in public places, so that, just as in the past the 
ordinances of the commonwealths were presented in a 
public place, so also the simple may be reminded 
everywhere of their blessedness, of the benefits of God, 
of the punishments inflicted on sinners, and whatever 
else is useful for edification. 

But, you will say, if paintings and pictorial works have 
such a great use, why 


Are they then forbidden and condemned by Moses and 
the prophets with such great zeal? | answer: Moses and 
the prophets speak of the images made for the purpose 
that they should be worshipped and that it should be 
believed that one honors God through this worship. To 
this we have a manifest testimony in the second 
commandment: "Do not worship them or serve them, for 
| am the LORD your God." Thus Moses says in the fifth 
book [Cap. 4, 15. ff.]: The Lord has spoken to you, you 
have heard his voice, you have not seen a likeness, so 
that you do not make for yourselves an image to worship. 
Therefore, all error in worship and service is due not to 
wood, not to stone, not to gold, not to silver, but to God 
the Creator Himself. 

Therefore, if there is no worship involved, one can 
make use of the images as well as the scriptures, which 
remind us of things and, as it were, put the things before 
our eyes. The Gospels present to us the history of Christ, 
the Law and the Prophets present to us the will of God. 
But who kisses the paper for the sake of it? Who worships 
it? Who thinks that GOD is served when he prostrates 
himself before the Holy Bible? Their custom is different, 
namely, to read it so that we may be instructed about the 
will of God and do it. 

Here, therefore, another difference of the images 
arises. Because some are lying and annoying, like the 
one of Barbara, Margaretha, George, Christophorus, 
Catharina 2c. Because these are lying (because what 
they represent never existed in reality), they are to be 
rejected, because they are only invented for idolatry. Just 
as one therefore rejects lying books - for even if one 
reads them for a long time, one still reads nothing but lies 
- so also these pictures are of no use at all. 

But it is not enough to remember that they are false, 
but for the sake of the astonishment they must be 
removed altogether. For what is the use of keeping them? 
Rather, just as no one has to suffer annoying images in 
his home, so they must be removed from the public 
churches, where everything that is said, written, sung, 
painted, formed, in short, everything. 


1000 L. XXVI, 269-272. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 1, 7. w. VI, 2748-2751. 


1001 





What we see and hear should serve for edification. And 
in this one must take into consideration the descendants, 
to whom this can lead to the annoyance and to the trap, 
as in the holy histories examples are present, where 
some good diuge, if they had become the annoyance, 
are taken away, as, the brazen snake 2c. But about this 
| will perhaps say more below. 

But what he adds: Samaria hath gathered them of 
whoredoms, and they shall become whoredoms again, 
this saying hath the appearance of a proverb, as we say, 
that that which is evil won shall be evil torn. For he calls 
with a common image the people who whored with idols 
a harlot, since they have forsaken the right bridegroom, 
God. These idols, the temple gifts, the magnificently 
decorated temples, all this, he says, is the reward of 
idolatry, which is obtained through the preaching of 
confidence in other gods; but just as all this is obtained, 
so it shall also perish. There will come a godless people 
who are without God, to whom these idols will become a 
prey 2c. 

Furthermore, we complain here, not inappropriately, 
about the extreme blindness and wickedness of the 
world. For we learn nowadays, as people are properly 
taught about God and God's service, as well as about 
truly good works, that an insatiable avarice has taken 
over the hearts and minds of all. No one supports the 
poor as liberally as he should. There are innumerable 
ways to raise prices even in the smallest things. But of 
all that is spent on the servants of the churches, on 
schools, one thinks that it is too much. Therefore, we see 
what is not only the greatest shame, but also the greatest 
sin of our time, that through the avarice of the people 
many parishes either completely fall away or are most 
miserably neglected. 

But look at the earlier times, when there was no proper 
way of worshipping God, when people were led to the 
service of idols and the vain trust in their own works, 
there was no end of giving. All the monasteries, all the 
monasteries of the monks of the mass were maintained 
in the greatest abundance in all things, the churches 
were filled with gold and 





Silver adorned that one had to be surprised about it. In 
short, one would like to say that gold and silver were 
considered inferior by the people at that time than the 
stones are now. Rightly this deplorable blindness of the 
race occurred, which the prophet indicates here, that 
idolatry had the best prosperity and the richest income, 
while the Levites, who presided over the true ministry in 
Jerusalem, were miserably starving. 

But what punishment is inflicted on those who gather 
riches through wickedness? Certainly the one of which 
the prophet says: He has collected them from the wages 
of harlots, 1) and to the wages of harlots they shall 
become again. Nowadays it is a great complaint that the 
spiritual goods are taken by our princes and are used for 
worldly custom. But first, if they are spiritual goods, dear 
one, how are they obtained? Has it not been through vain 
and ungodly preaching of masses, indulgences, merits, 
and similar antics? Then tell me, how do those use them 
who have the richest spiritual income? How many are 
they who teach the Gospel? who care for the poor, who 
in some way render such service to the Church? Are they 
almost not the only ones who persecute the Gospel in 
the most cruel way? who stubbornly hold on to idolatries 
of every kind and defend them with the greatest cruelty? 
who defile the church with innumerable aversions and 
the most shameful life? In short, they are in truth whore 
goods, and are used by those who have them for no 
other purpose than whorish ones. For either they 
squander them most shamefully, or they are cruelly 
sparing. But this is not yet the right punishment; they 
become the prey of others who neither know the right 
doctrine nor strive to propagate it. 

As for our princes, they are worthy of all praise, 
because they promote good studies and the teaching of 
religion excellently and at very great expense. Therefore, 
they are unjustly accused of having robbed and stolen 
the spiritual goods. Rather, those should be accused 
who do not support the church and yet rob the 
monasteries.

1003 





But this also happens to the papists according to the 
words of the prophet: "They are whores' wages, and shall 
become whores' wages again." 


V. 8. | must lament and howl over this; | must go 
about bereft and naked; | must lament against the 
dragons, and mourn against the ostriches. 


Although what follows is clear as far as the meaning 
is concerned (for the devastation, which he has 
prophesied briefly up to now, he now sets forth more 
abundantly and, as it were, in detail), the understanding 
of the words is nevertheless very obscure for the sake of 
the various allusions. 

And here, those who study the Scriptures are rightly 
reminded that they should apply themselves with great 
diligence to the study of the languages. For though one 
hears this interpreted in the best way, it is impossible for 
one who is wholly ignorant of the Hebrew language to 
understand it fully, for the sake of the images which no 
other language can imitate. 

The prophet has so far indicated that the desolation 
of the kingdom of Israel and Judah by the Assyrian will 
take place. Now he leads the reader, as it were, into the 
middle of the matter as a present one, and prophesies 
not differently, as if everything was before the eyes. 
Therefore these words are to be understood as of what 
will possibly occur (potentialiter), which in Hebrew is 
expressed by the future tense; for the Hebrew language 
has no optative. So great, he says, will be the calamity, 
that someone might or must howl Iran and howl like the 
dragons 2c. 

Furthermore, it is common in the Scriptures that 
whenever a desolation is indicated, it uses the simile of 
dragons and ostriches howling in desolate places, as it 
happens in Isaiah Cap. 13, 21, where he speaks of the 
destruction of Babylon, and Cap. 34, 13. of the 
destruction of the kingdom of Edom, and in Lamentations 
Cap. 4, 3, where he speaks of the destruction of 
Jerusalem 2c. The prophet mentions large beasts mainly 
for this reason, so that he may make the future sorrow 
great, because because of the size of their bodies they 
also emit a great roar. 

Of the ostriches it is written in Job 





[Cap. 39, 14. ff.] that it is a stupid animal and cruel to its 
young, since they lay their eggs on the ground and do 
not pay attention to them afterwards. The prophet 
therefore expressly remembers the young, so that he 
indicates that the people are completely abandoned, as 
a young is abandoned in truth, if the mother does not 
take care of it. 

The fact that he says: "| have to go naked" is to be 
referred to the exceedingly exquisite adornment; not as 
if he wanted to go completely naked, but that he wanted 
to take off the more splendid clothing and go in a bad 
dress (as the mourners used to do). So Isaiah was 
commanded [Cap. 20, 2. ff.] to go naked to indicate the 
captivity of Egypt. But we must not think that he went 
with his body completely bare; he was dressed in a bad 
and very short garment, but had taken off the long and 
more respectable garment. So it is said in the history of 
the gospel [Marc. 14, 52.] that the disciple merely fled 
from them, but let the linen go, which was the upper and 
more respectable garment. 


V. 9 For their plague is no counsel, which shall 
come unto Judah, and shall reach unto the gates of my 
people unto Jerusalem. 


The word means a fierce, severe and miserable 
plague that cannot be healed. This devastation, he says, 
which will begin in Israel, will not stop there; Judah will 
also feel this blow, yes, it will be felt in the gates of 
Jerusalem. For it is known from history that, as the 
prophet will prophesy shortly thereafter, Sanherib also 
devastated the kingdom of Judah and advanced as far 
as Jerusalem; when he besieged and surrounded it, he 
was driven out of there by the angel of the Lord and 
many of his own were killed. This is what the prophet 
indicates here. 


V. 10. Do not proclaim it in Gath, do not let 
yourselves be heard weeping; but go into the 
mourning chamber (in domo Aphra), and sit down in 
the ashes. 


This is where the images that cause difficulty begin, 
because there is no difficulty in the matter. 


1004 L. XXVI, 274-276. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 


What he says about Gath of the Philistines is taken 
from the Song of David 2 Sam. 1, 20, because the 
prophets often borrow something from the histories 
when there is some similarity in the matter. David sees 
that the kingdom has received a great wound through 
the death of Saul and his sons. He wishes that this 
misfortune could be concealed in such a way that the 
uncircumcised Philistines would not know about it and 
rejoice. The prophet wishes the same here, for the 
calamity is increased when the enemies are seen to 
rejoice. 

"Aphrah is in the tribe of Benjamin. For because he 
said that this plague of the kingdom of Israel would reach 
into Judah and to the gates of Jerusalem, he remembers 
the cities located in Benjamin and in the tribe of Judah. 

And here is the first pun: in the house of Aphra roll 1) 
in Aphar - dust]. The word aphar actually denotes the 
excavated earth, which is loose and not cohesive, like 
that which is dug out of the graves, and is commonly 
rendered by the word earth or dust. The opinion is 
therefore this: The city of Aphra rightly takes its name 
from the dust, for at that time its calamity will be so great 
that it will cheaply, as in the highest mourning, want to 
sprinkle itself with ashes. This was customary among 
the Jews in great dangers and in great mourning. 


V. 11. You beautiful city must go with all the shame. 


Here is no play in the word, but a beautiful contrast in 
the thing. means to be beautiful and adorned. This 
name, he says, Samaria has had hitherto; but whither 
has thy name come? Where has your adornment and 
beauty gone? For thou liest desolate, as if thou hadst 
never been, and thou art all covered with shame, even 
as if someone should strip a beautiful maiden adorned 
with delectable garments, and present her naked to the 
eyes of men to behold. 

Here is a Hebrew idiom which is used in the 


1) Erlanger: volntutk instead of: volnta t6. 





1, 10. 11. w. VI, 2785-2758. 1005 


Latin can only be rendered by a paraphrase. For so it 


reads from word to word: Transi vobis civitas decora, 
XXX XXXX, that is, go away and flee to another place, 
for that will serve thee, that will profit thee, counsel thee 
by flight. And there is also in these words a picture, xxxx 
and xxx. You have been until now, who has lived there 
safely; you are not used to wandering, but now you will 
have to wander. go there, "up and away, there is no more 
staying". 


The inhabitant of Zaenan will not move out for the 
sake of suffering. 


"Zaenan" is in the tribe of Judah, as is clear from 
Joshua [Cap. 15, 37? But it has its name from going out 
[xxx], as if one said: the walker. 

But here again there is a play on words: xxxx non xxx 
that is, [Zaenan] will not go out; it will stay in its house, 
as those who are in mourning are wont to do. For these 
flee of their own free will from the sight of men, that they 
may give free vent to their tears, as the prophet adds the 
cause. 


The neighboring house will take your belongings. 2) 


This is how | understand this passage, especially 
since other interpretations, which are brought by the 
commentators, 3) seem to be too forced, because if one 
also takes Beth Ezel [xxxxx xxx] as a proper name, then 
what should xxxxx be? It is interpreted as the camp of 
the enemy, but the opinion is too forced that it should be 
referred to the enemy receiving this reward for the stay 
he made there. Therefore, since this opinion is closer to 
the matter and also does not contradict the 
understanding of the word, | wanted to keep it, that Beth 


2) In our Bible translation "of the next house" is drawn with to the 
preceding, but here it is made the subject of the following. The sense 
is however also here the same, because "the neighboring house" is 
interpreted by the Asshrier. By the way, Dietrich deviates here from 
the Zwickau, the Hallischen and the Altenburger manuscript; these 
interpret "the neighboring house" from the kingdom Juda. 

3) Erlanger: atkereMur instead of: atikrnntnr. 


1006 D. XXVI, 276-278. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2758-2761. 


Ezel in appellative meaning, "the neighboring house", 
namely Assur, would receive from the inhabitants of 
Zaenan their belongings, that is, even that which they 
thought would remain and be safe for them. 


V. 12 The afflicted city (civitas Maroth) cannot 
comfort itself, for disaster will come from the Lord 
even to the gate of Jerusalem. 


There is no less darkness in this saying than there was 
in the previous one. For some declare xxx by suffering 
that the city of Maroth will suffer because of the lost 
goods. Others, that it is weakened in doing good, 
because it has not practiced obedience to the law and 
the word of God, as xxx means rebellious and 
disobedient. 

Some think that this is the meaning, that the city is 
weakened by its good or prosperity and good success, 
that is, it has become nonsensical, as the proverb says: 
To whom fortune favors, it makes a fool. For this is a 
common affliction of all flourishing communities, that 
they are deceived by good success and believe, 
because of their wealth and power, that they and theirs 
are safe when they are closest to danger. Therefore, 
when they are called to repentance by threats of future 
misfortune, they do not allow or believe them. Therefore, 
happiness and good fortune are in truth fatal diseases; 
for where the word is not heeded and repentance does 
not follow, punishment can no longer fail. 

But the simplest conception is this, may one take Maroth 
as a proper name or appellatively as a rebellious city, 
that it waits anxiously for good, because the people who 
are in danger become sorrowful and weak precisely 
because they wait for help, and wait in vain. This position 
of the heart is indicated by the word at this point. 


V.13. 0 city of Lachish, hire runners and depart; for 
thou art the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion, 
and in thee are found the transgressions of Israel. 


1007 


Lachis is well enough known; Sanherib also conquered 
it, as history shows. The prophet predicts this disaster, 
and as soon as the danger is present, he tells her to 
prepare a chariot and to flee. 

Furthermore, the prophet reminds us here of a peculiar 
history of which no certain traces are found elsewhere, 
namely, that Lachish first adopted in the kingdom of 
Judah the idolatry and the godless worship of the 
kingdom of Israel. 

But we are first instructed here that God uses to punish 
idolatry by wars and devastation. Secondly, that those 
deserve greater punishment who give others cause for 
idolatry by their example. In the Gospel [Matth. 18, 6. f.], 
Christ also threatens those most severely who cause 
others to be angry by their example. Therefore it 
behooves kings and princes in particular to take heed 
lest, while they themselves care little for religion, others 
spread idolatry and godless worship, as happens today. 
The authorities think that it is not their duty to see to it 
what is done in the church, therefore godless people 
insist on the abominations of the Pabst with all the 
greater audacity. But woe to those who, although they 
should prevent this according to God's commandment 
and could do so through their reputation, nevertheless do 
not do so. For, as this passage reminds us, those will 
suffer greater punishment after whose example others 
sin. 


V. 14. Therefore send envoys to Maresh Gath. The 
house of Achsib will deceive the kings of Israel. 1) 


The word comes from send. Therefore, it is free to 
interpret it either as a gift that is sent, or by messengers; 
for the sense remains the same. For he mockingly invites 
them to seek help from their neighbors, of whom he says 
that they have to struggle with the same dangers. 
Further, there is a darkness in this: some associate this 
saying with your going before- 


1) This verse reads in our Bible: "You will have to give sung as 
well as Gath. The city of Achsib will lack the kings of Israel." 


1008 L. xxvi, 27K-281. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 1, 14-16. w. vi, 2761-2764. 


den that Lachish should send gifts to the inhabitants of 
Maresa, neighbors of Gath of the Philistines; others 
relate it to Achsib. 

However, the prophet also uses a very beautiful play 
on words here: "The house of Achsib xxxx) will be for the 


kings of Israel to deceive (Achsab [xxxx]." But it means 
eiue lie, vou the verbum Itgeu, to deceive, to be in vain. 
Jos. 15, 44. Achsib is mentioned by name as being a city 
of Judah. This, as the prophet seems to indicate here, 
made a covenant with the kingdom of Israel. But as it 
happens in general, the prophet says, this alliance will 
not help them in the calamity that will come through the 
Asiprian. But it would not be inconsistent to take "the 
kings of Israel to lie" passively, i.e., those to whom the 
kings of Israel have lied, those who have deceived the 
kings of Israel by idolatry. 


V. 15. | will bring you, Maresa, the right heir. 


The prophet has given a brief register of the cities of 
Jnda, which the king Sanherib would lay waste after your 
kingdom of Israel. But also here is a dainty play on 
words: Maresa [xxxx] | will bring you xxxx, that is, an 
heir. The word xxxx means an_ inheritance or 
possession, for it comes from the verbum As if the 
prophet meant to say, You, Maresa, have the name of 
an heir; behold, | will make you the heir of a mighty 
enemy who will conquer and rob you. But all this, as | 
have said, is to teach repentance, so that they may 
believe that such punishments of ungodliness will surely 
follow, and therefore at times abandon ungodly worship 
and turn to the right religion. 


And the glory of Israel shall come unto Adullam. 


The cave "Adullam" is known from the history of 
David [J Sam. 22, 1].But | think that this is, as it were, 
the end of the threat; as if he wanted to say: The glory 
of Israel is great; it relies on its riches and its power, and 
therefore it is safe in the greatest sins. But 


1009 


verily it shall come to pass that all this glory, so many 
glorious and rich cities shall become as Adullam, a 
miserable and desolate cave, because of the desolation 
which Sanherib shall make. 

Thus we are now out of these dark places, although 
there is no great difficulty in the matter. The explanation 


of words (grammatica) is somewhat difficult, as is 
sufficiently evident from the translation of Jerome, who 
generally makes common names out of proper names, 
as elsewhere common names out of proper names. This 
passage, however, shows sufficiently how necessary 
the knowledge of the sacred language is for those 
concerned with theology. 


V. 16, Let the hair be shorn, and go bald over thy 
tender children; make thyself as bald as an eagle; for 
they are led away captive from thee. 


In mourning, they used to either pull out their hair or 
shave it off and go bald. Now that the kingdom of Israel 
was facing such a terrible devastation, and the kingdom 
of Judah was also facing such a devastation, the prophet 
wants the people to cover themselves with hair, as they 
do in the greatest mourning, and not to take care of their 
hair, as they do in well-being, good rest and happy days. 
For, he says, your children, whom you have brought up 
with great hopes, will be taken away by the enemy to a 
foreign land. 

Thus, this first sermon refers entirely to the fact that 
we should flee idolatry with the utmost diligence, which 
is not followed by light punishments, but by the utmost 
desolation. For if God avenges injustice against one's 
neighbor with terrible punishments, as the following 
chapter will show, how much more should we believe 
that God will be an even harsher avenger when He sees 
that His honor is suppressed by godless people through 
idolatry, through godless teaching and godless worship! 

But this sermon is also necessary for our times. For 
how many abominations have been introduced into the 
church by the popes for more than six hundred years! 
Necessity has forced them to read at least the text of the 
Gospel in the churches. 


1010 L. XXVI, 281-283. 


"Interpretations on the Prophets. 'W. VI, 2764-2769. 


1011 





This, too, happened much less frequently in Italy and 
other nations than in Germany. Thus they had to retain 
baptism and Holy Communion, even though they have 
defiled both sacraments in many ways, one of which 
they have also mutilated in an ungodly manner. 
Necessity forced them to keep them. 

But putting this aside, nothing has been done in the 
whole of life by a pope as pope, by a bishop as bishop, 
by amass priest as mass priest, by a monk as monk, by 
a nun as nun, for so many centuries, that has not been 
done by a bishop as a bishop, by a mass priest as a 
mass priest, by a monk as a monk, by a nun as a nun, 
that has not been done by a bishop as a bishop, by a 
mass priest as a mass priest. 


The people of the world are not in the same position. For 
even their good works have been disgraced by the 
ungodly delusion of merit. Since even today the popes 
want this godlessness to remain unharmed, since they 
stubbornly hold on to it and defend it with inhuman 
cruelty, how is it possible that God should not punish in 
His time, and in a short time, with the devastation of all 
of Germany? For he will not go unpunished who 
blasphemes the name of God and despises His word 
and His will, as this example of the kingdom of Israel 
clearly shows. 


The second chapter. 


V. 1. Woe to those who seek to do harm, and deal 
wickedly in their camp, that they may accomplish it 
early, when it is light, because they have power. 


We have finished One Sermon of the Prophet, in 
which he predicted both the kingdom of Israel and Judah 
the future calamity by the Assyrian. But he has added 
the cause, which is quite different from that which could 
be understood by reason, because reason recognizes 
only the sins that are done against the second table. Of 
the works of the first table it has no knowledge at all. 
Therefore, the word of God is necessary to reveal the 
sins against the first table. 

The people of both kingdoms boasted of worship and 
a special zeal for religion. But the prophet says that the 
religion to which they adhere is the foremost cause of all 
their misfortunes. For since nothing can be called the 
service of God but what is done according to the word of 
God, all that men do without the word as the service of 
God is idolatry, and deserves the utmost punishment. 
For although other sins that are committed against the 
second tablet also have their penalties, these services 
that are performed out of human delusion or human 
devotion deserve to be punished. 





without a revealed word, greater and more certain 
punishments. Therefore, the prophet punishes idolatry 
in the first place and shows what its punishments will be, 
because idolatry is always connected with blasphemy 
and disrespect for the word. 

According to this, idolatry is also the cause of a 
vicious life. For how can life be rightly arranged or led if 
no consideration is given to the word? That is why the 
prophet started this second sermon, in which he also 
punishes the sins that reason can judge, avarice, 
injustice, violence, unjust judgment and the like. For 
these things do not have any semblance of holiness with 
which to protect themselves, as idolatry does, and yet 
the ungodly think that this cannot be perceived under 
the pretense of idolatry. 

Thus, a great holiness is pretended by the monks 
and by the mass priests when they have to say mass as 
often as something has to be performed in public. But 
when one comes to the wine, to the whores, to the 
collection of money, then they only show how much this 
pretense of holiness is close to their hearts. 

It is the same with the popes. Dear God, how holy, 
how meek, how humble they are when processions or 
supplications take place. 


1012 L. XXVI, 283-285. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 2, 1. 2. W. VI, 2769-2772. 


when indulgences are given to the foolish multitude! 
But it is nothing to these very people to kill the godly 
teachers in large numbers all over the world, it is 
nothing to them to release the subjects from 
obedience and the oath, as often as the emperors or 
the princes do not want to comply with their desires, 
it is nothing to them to entangle whole empires in war 
and bloodshed. | shall not mention fraudulent actions 
in courts, insatiable avarice, unspeakable lusts, all of 
which, of course, even the common people recognize 
as being worthy of cursing. But nevertheless those 
who do this think that this is covered by the splendor 
of religion, and does not stand out so much. 

Therefore, this sermon also serves the doctrine of 
repentance, that we should learn that equal 
punishments follow equal sins. For if avarice, if fraud 
and deceit in court dealings were the cause of such 
great misfortune at that time, what better can we 
expect now that you see people possessed and taken 
over by avarice to the greatest misfortune of the 
poor? 

The word the prophet uses here, which we have 
translated by "harm," is very common. For it is often 
taken for idolatry, because it is followed by toil and 
labor, but in this place it is generally taken of any 
injustice or wrong done by the mighty to the lowly. 

But here the prophet speaks of a very strong 

desire to do harm, saying that even in their beds they 
cannot rest without thinking how they will do harm, 
how they will stalk others, how they will make others 
uncomfortable, just as the 36th Psalm, v. 5, describes 
this behavior of the wicked very well and almost in the 
same words: "They seek harm in their camp, and 
stand firm in their evil way, and do no evil. Woe to 
such people, says the prophet, for in his time they will 
suffer unbearable judgment. 
Here belong also the circumstances of the time, 
which he adds, that they commit in the earliest 
morning what they have devised treacherously in the 
night to other people's harm. This 





1013 


is not inappropriately understood by those who are in 
the highest position in the church and in the state, 
namely, that the godless teachers investigate with 
the highest zeal what may well serve to increase and 
enlarge their wealth; then that those who are in public 
offices and in the judiciary do not look at what is just, 
not at what is fair and good, but at what is useful to 
them, and give and repeal laws for their benefit. 

And of course, how can an evil tree bring forth 
other fruit than evil fruit? Therefore we have a shining 
example of it in the papacy, which has dealt with 
nothing else, has been more careful about nothing 
than how they would bring about wealth and power 
and not suffer lack. From this arose the cruel tyranny, 
that for the sake of a few pennies they publicly 
banished the people. But in time they will have to give 
an account of all their doings down to the last penny. 

There is a darkness here in the grammar. For what 
we have translated, "Because they have the power," 
is in Hebrew: For it is xxx their hand. But because the 
word is often attached to GOtte, therefore Jerome 
translates: For against GOtte is their hand. But this 
word is also used appellatively for strong, powerful, 


and in abstracto for force, strength, as Proverbs 3, 


27: If your hand is able (potens est) to do good, then 
1) do not refuse to do good to the poor, xxxxx XXX XXX 
so also Deut. 28, 32: "There will be no strength in 
your hands, xxx xxxx xxxx. In this way the prophet 
also speaks here: They are ready to do harm and 
deal with it day and night because they are powerful. 
Therefore, the inferiors must be silent about the 
injustice; they cannot avert it. 


V. 2: They take for themselves the fields and the 
houses they desire, so they do violence to every man's 
house and every man's inheritance. 

The prophet beautifully exalts the avarice of the 
wicked, and especially that of the

1014 XXVI, 285-287. interpretations on the prophets. 


'W. VI, 2772-2775. 


1015 





Teachers; as also Christ saith [Matt. 23:14.], "Woe 
unto you, Christian teachers and Pharisees, 
hypocrites, which eat widows' houses." 

Outstanding examples of such avarice are today 
the so many monasteries of the priests, the so many 
monasteries, the so rich incomes, the so great 
splendor of the buildings. For what ruler has ever 
been or is today who could equal them in such 
wealth? They boast of the donations of Constantine 
and the emperors, but if we look at the truth, these 
donations must be taken as the prophet says. They 
have coveted such goods and then stolen them, not 
with obvious violence, but by deceiving people with 
the appearance of religion and persuading them to 
make a ladder to eternal life for themselves in this 
way. However, there are many well-known examples 
before our eyes where they also acted with obvious 
violence. For that is why the bishops have been 
granted lands and cities that belonged to the empire 
not so many years ago. 


Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, | remember 
evil against this generation, out of which ye shall not 
draw your necks, neither shall ye walk so proudly: for 
it shall be an evil time. 


The prophet also uses a very fine image here: 

You, he says, think evil against others, therefore | 
also think evil against you, by which you shall be 
bound as by a fetter, so that you cannot pull out your 
necks. 
But he looks beautifully at the thoughts of those who 
are oppressed by injustice, who are forced to bear 
the unjust violence. They judge in such a way that 
those who have great power and riches have a 
certain loophole against dangers of every kind. If 
there is theurung, their situation is better, for they 
have plenty of bread when others are starving. In 
war, they seem to be able to buy their salvation 
through their goods. At the time of the pestilence they 
change the place and guess themselves by the 
escape. This protection is provided for the rich and 
powerful in such adversities, which the poor and 
oppressed do not have. But the Lord threatens that 
there will be a 


that they will not be saved by this protection. 
Therefore, the prophet comforts the poor and 
oppressed so that they will not doubt that God sees 
the injustice and deceitfulness of the powerful and 
will punish them in His time, so that the poor will 
beware of revenge and will be accustomed to 
repentance, since the Lord will strike them with 
unavoidable punishment in His time. 

Thus the pride and arrogance that follow wealth 
seem to be an unbearable burden. But the prophet 
indicates that a very great change will follow, so that, 
just as the lowly will be forced to humble themselves 
and, as it were, to walk bowed down, weighed down 
by injustice, so also in his time, when the Lord 
executes the punishments, those who go in will be 
straightened up and proudly humbled by the 
inevitable calamity. 

This is a glorious consolation when applied to the 
examples and to really existing conditions. The 
arrogance of Egypt was unbearable, for Israel was so 
weighed down with heavy work that it could not 
breathe. On the other hand Pharaoh and his people 
walked proudly in the highest idleness. Here Israel 
could think that God had forgotten him. But what a 
sweet change took place! Israel goes safely with the 
treasures of Egypt to the land of promise, Egypt is 
humiliated and perishes. As before the necks of the 
enemies were straightened, so afterwards it was the 
greatest pleasure to see the enemies surrounded on 
all sides with such terror of death that there was 
nowhere to escape. 

Therefore this passage belongs to the saying of 
the 91st Psalm, v. 8: "You will see how the wicked will 
be repaid. Those who are oppressed and humiliated 
by tyrants should comfort themselves with this hope 
and expect the Lord's vengeance, but abstain from 
their own vengeance. 


In that day shall they say of you, It is finished, they 
shall say, We are forsaken. My people's land will be 
given to a foreign master. When will he restore to us 
the fields he has taken from us? 


1016 L. XXVI, 287-290. interpretation of Micah (L.), cap. 2, 4-6. 


W. VI, 2776-2779. 1017 





Here a somewhat freer translation is necessary, 
because the Hebrew language has a certain peculiar 
way of speaking here, and moreover the brevity 
increases the darkness. Your misfortune, he says, will 
be celebrated with speeches and public songs. But this 
will be the song: "It's over, we're lost." The land and the 
people, which until now had the name that it was God's 
people, will now have another master, namely the 
Assyrian. For he has so disturbed the kingdom of Israel 
that he did not give the fields to the people again, but to 
his warriors, as is known from history. 

Because he says here of a final disturbance, | think 
that he speaks only of the kingdom of Israel, not of the 
kingdom of Judah, which, although it was also 
devastated by the Assyrian, the Assyrian has not so 
seized; rather, he was subsequently so affected by 
adversities in his homeland that he never returned to 
Judah, as is clear from the prophecy of Isaiah. For at that 
time the power of the Babylonians began to grow, and 
they finally conquered the Assyrians and took control. 


V. 5: Yea, ye shall have no part in the congregation 
of the Lord. 


This also belongs to the song. And here again it 
becomes clear that he speaks of the final desolation, that 
the citizens of the kingdom of Israel are to be taken away 
in such a way that they will not return afterwards, nor will 
they have any part in the congregation of the Lord, that 
is, in the people of Israel. For the fact that the prophets 
also preach that Israel is to be restored refers to the 
spiritual kingdom of Christ, in which the Israelites are 
called to the kingdom of God through the gospel, who 
lived in misery among the Gentiles and were also 
degenerated into Gentiles; it does not refer to the 
physical kingdom, of which the prophet speaks here. 

These are the thoughts of God against the godless, 
who abuse both doctrine and their power to oppress 
others and to increase their goods. The same judgment 
will await the godless papacy, which, because of its 
insatiable avarice and immoderate desire for money, has 
no end in sight. 


with its idolatry and godless worship. 

Some take this part: "You will not keep a portion" to 
mean that it is the same as what Paul says [Eph. 5:5]: "A 
miser does not have an inheritance in the Kingdom of 
God. This view is certainly true, but the other seems to 
be more in accordance with history and actual. 


V. 6. They say not to be baptized; for such baptism 
does not befall us, we will not be so put to shame. 1). 


This [ne stilletis] is not good Latin, and yet the 
expression had to be retained, which the Scriptures also 
use in other places. For it is common for the Hebrews to 


use the word "stillavit" for teaching, prophesying, 
preaching, as in general the Scriptures use the same 
image to denote teaching by rain, as Ps. 68:10: "But now 
you, God, give your inheritance a gracious rain," where 
it speaks of the teaching of the Gospel to be spread 
throughout the world by the apostles. 

Furthermore, here the prophet begins a new doctrine or 
a new sermon, which actually concerns the authorities, 
both in the spiritual and in the temporal state, who 
worked against the prophets, who exhorted the people 
to repentance and threatened the future destruction, 
holding out to them the promises that had been made to 
this people of the eternal kingdom of David, and 
accusing the prophets of lying, in imitative speech 
(XXXXXXXXX). One must take this closer 

The prophets have spoken in the person of those wicked 
rulers who surely despised the threats of the prophets, 
being presumptuous of the promises made to this 
people, as we also said at the beginning of this prophet. 
Therefore they say: Do not call, do not preach such 
things. 

The prophet answers in the name of God and the 
Church: Yes, they shall cry. This threat will not be in vain; 
we will not be frightened by your reputation. 


1) In Latin: Na stiilatis. lirio stiNabunt. Na stiiiatis illis, from anim 
tanta appratianaat aos iZvominia. This is what the interpretation 
refers to.

8. XXVI, 290-292. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2779-2782. 


1019 





Here the godless authorities again put their prestige 
before and do not want this to be taught by the 
prophet. They say: Do not call these, that is, do not 
threaten this people. They add the reason: The 
shame will not seize these, that is: You, Micah, and 
others, you lie, you prophesy destruction, but God 
has promised that he will establish the kingdom of 
David forever; therefore the shame will not hit this 
people. 

But it is useful to see in the prophet these 
examples of presumption, for often this certainty of 
the wicked breaks the courage of the weak. Look at 
the papists today; they do not act differently against 
us than if they were made certain by God's voice that 
their idolatry is pleasing to God, but our teaching is 
false and not pleasing to God. This certainty is also 
punished by Christ in the Gospel [John 16:2], when 
he says of the synagogue: "The time is coming when 
he who kills you will think he is doing God service." 
And John the Baptist says [Matt. 3:7], "Who then hath 
shewed you that ye shall escape the wrath to come?" 
As if to say, "You are as certain that God's judgment 
will not come upon you as if this were indicated to you 
by God Himself through a voice from heaven. In the 
same way, they call the prophet silent, as if they were 
sure that he was lying and that the evil he threatened 
the wicked would not come. 

The extraordinary brevity that is in this passage 
causes obscurity, so the commentators have 
different opinions here. | think that this view is the 
simplest one. 


V. 7 The house of Jacob comforts itself: "Do you 
think that the spirit of the Lord is shortened? 


This also belongs to the foregoing, for | take it to 
be said in imitation in the person of the wicked, who 
accuse the prophet of lying, and comfort themselves 
that this calamity will not come. 

Therefore there is an emphasis on the name "the 
house of Jacob", as if they wanted to say: Do not 
believe the prophet. Have you 





Have you forgotten that you are the house of Jacob? 
To whom has the Lord given such rich promises? 
May the prophet threaten the Gentiles who do not 
have such promises and live in sins. We are the 
people of God, therefore we will keep this hope, the 
Spirit of the Lord is not shortened; if He promises 
something, He can also fulfill it. And the works of God 
are known, by which he has testified that he always 
wants us well. He delivers us from Egypt and does 
not drown us in the Red Sea, for that is Pharaoh's 
due. He sets us in the land of Canaan, does not push 
us out, for that is due to the godless heathen. God's 
works for this people are therefore: to save, to deliver, 
to adorn; it is not God's works to destroy, to abandon, 
to disgrace, as Micah mendaciously threatens. 

This is truly an excellent picture of the godless, 
who are extraordinarily presumptuous of God's favor, 
even when misfortune is near. Hence it is that they 
do not accept the doctrine of repentance, as our 
papists, when they hear that their masses and other 
ungodly ceremonies are condemned, not only do not 
change and reject them, but hope even more 
stubbornly for them, whereas the godly, as Job [Cap. 
9, 28. Vulg.] fear all their works, even the good ones, 
and cannot have such confidence in the promises 
and mercy as the wicked have, even when they do 
the most fearful things. Therefore, the arts of Satan 
must be countered: the godly hearts must be 
established with consolations, while the secure ones 
must be disgraced and broken with threats. 

We, who nowadays adhere to the pure doctrine, 
can by no means stand up in the face of such great 
rages of the world and Satan as the papists stand up 
with the comfort that the church will not perish. For 
wherever we turn our eyes, we are frightened in many 
ways. The raging of the world and of Satan is 
extremely great, through which he seeks to eradicate 
this doctrine. Those with whom there seemed to be 
some protection also suffer from their infirmities, for 
either they flatter the popes to have an opportunity for 
gain, or they have not so 


1020 L. XXVI, 2S2-294. interpretation of Micah (.1.), cap. 


2,7. W. VI, 2782-2785. 1021 





The people of the country have a lot of courage to 
oppose the unjust tyranny; therefore we see how there 
is almost no help from the authorities. 

How many weaknesses and damages are there 
among us who, by God's grace, have pure doctrine! 
There are quite clear signs that our churches will suffer 
an unbelievable lack of teachers; | will gladly keep silent 
about other damages. Since all this is before our eyes, 
our hearts cannot help but fear it all. But look at the 
papists 1). In their obvious idolatry, in vices and sins of 
every kind, they nevertheless retain hope and shout with 
all their might that the church will not perish. Why do we 
not do the same, who, though we are weak, 
nevertheless have forgiveness of sins through Christ 
and confess the pure doctrine? 

But with these things it is like this: it is useful for Satan 
that the papists are as safe as possible, because then 
they do not improve, nor do they repent. On the other 
hand, he is pleased that we are frightened and stand in 
fear, and let ourselves be moved more by the images of 
terror that he holds before us than by the consolation and 
promises of our victor and savior Christ. Thus the 
Scriptures everywhere hold up to us the bitterest 
lamentations of the prophets against the triumph of the 
wicked, who should shortly suffer the utmost calamity. 


It is true, my speeches are kind to the pious. 


Here the prophet answers and refutes with a few 
words everything that can be held up by the wicked. 
Certainly, he says, | do not say that the spirit of God is 
shortened, | do not say that it is God's work that he 
perishes. But this refers to those who are pious; there no 
such great calamity can occur that the Lord should not 
stop it by his Spirit and save his own. But where men do 
not walk righteously, God truly punishes and heaps 
calamities of every kind upon them.

2) Erlanger: terrieula rnentis instead of: terricularuentiZ. 


And this saying is as it were an interpretation of all 
legal promises. For these are conditional, as the 
promise 3) of the kingdom of David in the 132nd Psalm 
indicates. David is promised descendants, the 
confirmation of the priesthood, peace, abundant food 
and good things of every kind, but with this condition [v. 
12]: "If your children will keep my covenant and my 
testimony, which | will teach them." The godless Jews 
did not heed this condition; they set up certain services 
without God's commandment, they gave free rein to their 
lusts and took no heed of the word. Since the prophets 
then punished these sins and threatened destruction, 
the wicked held the promises against them. Quite right, 
says the prophet, the promises are true, they will not lie; 
but to those who are pious; for to the wicked God 
promises nothing but wrath and destruction. 

Thus, since the papists boast of the promises made 
to the church, | do not deny that the promises are true, 
but | do deny that they are the church, since they 
persecute the church and its head, Christ, with such 
great cruelty, and persistently defend their idolatry and 
ungodly doctrine. Therefore, it follows that God speaks 
good against His church, but against those who are not 
the church He speaks very evil, as the prophet soon 
adds with regard to His people. 

Furthermore, we have often recalled the difference 
between the promises of the Law and the Gospel. The 
prophet speaks here in a legal way that God is good and 
speaks good against the good, that is, against those 
who do the law and follow the word of God, because that 
is called "being pious". But Christ speaks differently 
[Matth. 9, 13.P. "| have not come to call the pious to 
repentance, but sinners." For forgiveness of sins and 
eternal life are not promised to us because of our 
worthiness or our works, but for the sake of the Son of 
God, if we recognize our sins and believe that they have 
been atoned for and forgiven through Christ.

have followed the former reading. 


1022 XXVI, 294-297. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2786-2789. 


1023 





Since fearful minds want to apply such sermons 
as the prophet's here to the promises of the Gospel, 
and think that God will forgive sins only when we are 
pious, they must be reminded that we have nothing to 
add to the promises of the Gospel but faith, that we 
believe that what was done through Christ was done 
for us, and for Christ's sake hope for forgiveness of 
sins and eternal life. This hope or confidence must be 
held fast even when our sins come before us. For 
whoever allows this hope or confidence to be 
snatched away because of his sins, adds to these 
sins the sin that he does not value the blood of the 
Son of God more highly than his sins, and remains in 
unbelief against the commandment of God. 

Furthermore, the gospel not only demands 
obedience to the law, but also promises believers the 
Holy Spirit, through whom they can fulfill the law. But 
because of this fulfillment, sins are not forgiven, nor 
is eternal life granted, but because of faith in Christ, 
who died for our sins and rose again for our 
righteousness [Rom. 4:25]. Therefore we must be 
careful here not to make the law into the gospel, and 
not to transfer the prophet who speaks of the law to 
the promises of the gospel, which are offered to 
sinners and belong to sinners, as Christ says [Matth. 
9, 13.]: "I, am not come to call the pious, but sinners." 


V. 8. For my people have risen up like an enemy; 
for they steal both skirts and coats from those who go 
safely, as well as from those who come out of war. 


Because the wicked held out against the promises 
and comforted themselves with them, but left 
repentance in abeyance, the prophet made a very 
necessary distinction and said that they only apply to 
those who walk rightly, that is, who follow the word 
and are godly. But now he shows that the people of 
Jacob were not like this. 





For, he says, it holds itself hostile, it exercises an 
intolerable tyranny over those whose brethren it 
should spare. Therefore, let them consider that not 
the promises, but the threats, which are held out to 
such sinners, belong to them. 

Jerome followed a different opinion: Those who 
were simple-minded or safe, you have stirred up to 
war; that is, you sow discord where there is no 
discord. Thus the popes have often driven princes, 
who were very good friends, by their lies and 
calumnies to corrupt one another. But our view is the 
true one, and agrees with the grammar. 


Vv. 9 You drive the wives of my people from their 
dear homes and always take my jewelry from their 
young children. 


This also belongs to the description of the violence 
against the poor, which he also punished at the 
beginning of this chapter, because idolatry is always 
connected with avarice. 

But it is a great cruelty to deprive widows and 
orphans of their goods, just as Christ condemns this 
cruelty to the Pharisees [Matt. 23:14]: "Woe to you 
who devour widows' houses." For since they are the 
most exposed to injustice, they should be taken care 
of protectively, especially those who are in a 
magisterial office. But, he says, "you drive them out 
of their dear homes," that is, out of the dwellings that 
are dear and pleasant to them, as the Greeks say: 
XXXX XXXXX, XXXXX 
XXXXXXX, because the best house is the one in which 
one likes to be. Thus, the widows and orphans have 
their houses as nests "dear houses", even if they are 
not splendid, because they like to be there and, as we 
say in the Dentin, they are at home. The prophet 
wanted to express this movement of the heart in order 
to make the cruelty of the miserly people great. 

The word XXX means adornment and splendor, 
which is in the suit or clothing. But in this place he 
calls so the inheritance which has fallen to the 
children who have lost the father; to this, he says, you 
are straggling, inflicting a damage on the poor 
children of the widows which can never be repaired. 


1024 L. xx vi, 297-299. exegesis of Micah (1.), Cap. 2, 10-12. 


W. VI, 2789-2792. 1025 





V.10. Therefore arise, you must leave, you shall not 
remain here; because of their uncleanness they must 
be rudely destroyed. 

Here he concludes the sermon preached against 
the avarice of the godless teachers and authorities. 
Because you have treated the poor widows and their 
underage children so cruelly, you will be repaid in 
kind, for you too will be expelled. Therefore, you hope 
in vain that you will have permanent homes here. This 
will not be your rest; you will have to wander among 
the Gentiles, 1) and there bear all the hardships of 
captivity. 

| take this piece therefore also in such a way that 
it goes on the Neich Israel, which should be 
completely devastated by the Assyrian, both because 
of the idolatry and because of the avarice and other 
sins, which the prophet has told. But because 
everywhere an immoderate avarice reigns among all 
classes, so | should think that these sermons also go 
to the people of our time, because the same sins are 
paid with the same punishments. 


V. ii. If 1 were a false spirit, and a preacher of lies, 
and preached how they should drink and revel; that 
would be a preacher to this people. 

The shortness is always a cause of the darkness, 
therefore about this saying the one has this, the other 
another opinion. Jerome has translated the little word 


XX by utinam, 2) but thereby brings out a not at all 
suitable sense. This opinion of ours is simpler and 
more appropriate to the intention of the prophet. For 
the prophet complained that he not only could not 
lead the Jews to repentance by these threats of future 
misfortune, but that they actually tried to prevent him 
from teaching. This piece also belongs to this 
complaint. As if he wanted to say: In vain do | preach 
to you when | predict future misfortune. But if | 
promise you abundance of fruit, peace, riches, 
glorious victories, if | promise your

2) In the Vulgate: Utinum non essoin vir dudons spirituln - O that | 
were not a man who has the spirit. 





If | were to eat and drink and approve of your 
indulgence, | would be a pleasant prophet to you. 
But he uses a delicate image, which we cannot 


render in Latin, for he calls a vain (Vanum) man, and 
he who promises vain things, XXX XXX XXX a man 
who walks in the wind. He indicates that there were 
many such teachers among the people at that time, 
who turned a blind eye to the sins of the people, 
comforted them, promised them victories against the 
Gentiles: such teachers, he says, are pleasant to you, 
but you cannot stand me, but such people walk in the 
wind, that is, they promise futile things. 

This is zero the second sermon, in which he 
condemns the avarice, especially of those who were 
the rulers in the church, and threatens the 
disturbance. For after the manner of the prophets, he 
now turns away from the present so wicked people 
and comforts the godly with a glorious sermon about 
the kingdom of Christ. 


V.12. But | will gather thee, O Jacob, altogether, and 
will gather the remnant of Israel together: | will put 
them as an herd together into a strong stall, and as an 
herd into his hurdles, and they shall sound as of men. 


So far, the prophet has exhorted the people to 
repentance and has contrasted the thoughts of God 
with the thoughts of the godless and secure people 
who seized power and did whatever they pleased 
without hesitation. 

Now he uses a transition, because he turns the 
speech from your present people and the physical 
kingdom to the spiritual kingdom of Christ. For this is 
the way of the prophets, that after they have punished 
the ungodly, who surely sin, and prophesied of the 
future destruction, they finally also preach of the 
eternal kingdom of Christ, and that for the sake of the 
godly, not only that they may comfort them in this 
way, but also that they may increase their hope, so 
that they may not despair of the kingdom of Christ for 
fear of the physical calamity. 

However, when reading the prophets, it is 
important to pay careful attention to these transitions, 
because they are often very sudden, 


1026 XXVI, 299-302. Reflections on the Prophets. W, VI, 2792-2795. 1027 





so that one can hardly believe that the prophets 
depart so quickly from the discussion they have 
begun without any reason. Therefore, if you want to 
connect this following passage with the previous one 
and understand it to be about the outward or bodily 
restoration of the people, you will be completely in 
error. When was the kingdom of Israel restored? But 
if it has not been restored, what does the prophet who 
1) says that it shall be restored want? It is true that 
the Jews, moved by these promises, stubbornly hope 
for a bodily salvation, but in vain. For the prophet 
does not speak of a physical salvation, but of a 
spiritual salvation, which takes place through the 
gospel of Christ, which has been proclaimed in the 
whole world. There is scattered all Jacob and the rest 
of Israel, who accept the gospel by faith, and believe 
through Christ to obtain forgiveness of sins and 
eternal life. Because the Jews do not understand this 
"gathering together", it happens that the longer they 
wait and hope, the less hope remains. 

But, you will say, why is this not more clearly 
indicated by the prophets? | answer [John 1:18], "The 
Son which is in the bosom of the Father hath declared 
it unto us." For this had to be veiled, so that the clarity 
of the Gospel might be distinguished from the clarity 
of the Law and surpass it. The sermons of Christ and 
of the apostles interpret all these mysteries in the 
clearest way. Since the Jews do not want to 
recognize them, they are rightly kept in this 
frightening blindness. 

Now as to the words of the prophet, he expressly 
says that Jacob shall be gathered gauz, and the 
remnant in Israel shall come in multitude, even as the 
promise of Abraham is a general one [Gen. 12:3.], "In 
thee shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." 

Here careless readers start again and refer the 


general promises to a fulfillment (eventum), which is 


only a partial one. For not all believe, therefore not all 
will be saved. Therefore must 


1) Erlanger: instead of: yni. 





one holds the Unterschieb, because it is something 
different:. "In you all nations shall be blessed", as: All 
nations are to accept this promise of blessing. For 
although the Gospel offers to all the forgiveness of 
sins and eternal life through Christ, not all accept this 
promise of the Gospel. Thus the prophet says in this 
passage: "I will gather you, Jacob, completely,” and 
yet the fulfillment teaches that the majority of the 
people did not believe the gospel and were therefore 
rejected. So the prophet indicates the same thing 
when he says of the "remnant of Israel. 

Why, you will say, are the sayings so general? Of 
course, so that no one may be excluded from the 
promise of the gospel. For Christ is not the treasure 
of one people or of one time, 1) but is offered to all 
through the word. But the fact that not all accept Christ 
is due to their own fault, because they do not believe 
and abandon themselves to their unbelief. 
Meanwhile, God's saying and promise remains 
general, that God wants all men to be saved. 

In this way the prophet says that all Jacob should 
be gathered together, because God wants Christ to 
be the common treasure of all, as Christ says: "God 
so loved the world that he gave his Son, that whoever 
believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. 
Behold His zeal in gathering all into One sheepfold, to 
One grace, through Christ. But the unbelievers resist 
this will, because they do not want to obey the word 
and accept it. Therefore, only the rest of Israel will be 
gathered and saved. 

But the prophet uses a simile that is taken from a 
shepherd and his sheep, which is often used not only 
in the prophets but also in the New Testament. For it 
comprehends much in itself that clarifies Christ's 
ministry and also teaches us about the fate of the 
church. For Christ himself in more than one place 
attaches to himself the name of a shepherd, in order 
to indicate that his kingdom

1029 





not by force or in the flesh, but by feeding the sheep 
with the word, as he expressly says [John 10:27]: "My 
sheep hear my voice." And in the Psalm it is said 
[Ps.23, 4.], "Thy rod and thy staff comfort me." By 
these tools of a shepherd the word is signified, which 
is suitable both to teach the church and to keep away 
the wolves. 

Thus the church has the name of sheep or a flock, 
not only because it proves innocence, does violence 
to no one, is gentle and kind, but even more because 
it shows that it is subject to tribulations and exposed 
to injustice, as the prophet says of Christ [Is.53, 7.]: 
"Like a lamb led to the slaughter." And in the Psalm 
it says [Ps.44, 23.]: "We are esteemed like sheep for 
slaughter." And here belongs the great danger that 
threatens the sheep from the wolf, that is, first from 
Satan himself, then from Satan's servants, that is, 
from false teachers and tyrants. For these combine 
their efforts to snatch the sheep from their right 
shepherd and plunge them into damnation. 

Because the ministry of preaching remedies these 

ills, the church ministers are also called "shepherds. 
But the one and right shepherd is our Lord Christ 
Jesus, for he alone lays down his life for his sheep. 
For he reproaches Satan for devouring and killing 
him, so that in this way safety and eternal life may be 
brought to the sheep. Because this consolation is 
true and certain, the prophet here presents it to the 
godly, so that through this hope they may soothe and 
overcome the adversity of captivity. In this way we 
also comfort people in tribulations, so that they may 
remember that they will be repaid with eternal goods, 
which Christ the shepherd earned for his sheep by 
laying down his life for them. 
What he says about the one sheepfold agrees with 
what Christ says in the Gospel, John 10:16. For 
those who believe in Christ are gathered together in 
the same word, in the same spirit, in the same hope, 
in the same forgiveness of sins. 





and the same life, whether they be Jews or Gentiles. 
But the prophet uses the word "with one another" 


(uniendi) because the kingdom of Israel was 
completely alienated from the kingdom of Judah. 
These enmities, he says, will cease when the gospel 
will be preached, because all will be like sheep 
enclosed in One sheepfold, being fed at the same 
time, under the same Shepherd. 


That it should sound of people. 


In Hebrew it is said: 07%? it shall roar before the 
crowd. But we understand the raving generally from 
the movement, as it is in a riot. But the word XXX 
actually denotes raving, as Virgil used this word 


(fremere) almost everywhere, when in a large 
gathering of voices sounding in confusion cause a 
great noise, as he also calls the raging of the sea 


(fremitum maris) the roar that the waves produce 
when they crash against the cliffs. 1) Thus it is said, 
Proverbs 1:21: XXXXX XXXXX in the head of the 
meetings, that is, in the assemblies, where there is a 
great crowd and causes a roar. 

Therefore, there is no doubt about the meaning, 
that the prophet wants this, that the gospel should be 
proclaimed in the whole world, and that the crowd and 
abundance of believers will be so great that it seems 
to be a riot. For where there is a great crowd, the 
voices sound confusedly one after the other and 
represent, as it were, a riot. Therefore, this piece 
belongs to the conversion of the Gentiles and to the 
ministry of the Word, which is therefore also 
compared to the voices of riotous people, because it 
arouses the world and the world opposes it. 


V. 13. a breaker shall come up before them, they 
shall break through and go out to the gate; and their 
king shall go before them, and the LORD in front. 

What Jerome translates: one who opens the way, 
that is a breaker, a disperser who breaks through by 
force. 


1) VirZ. XkLkis, lib. IX, v. 717 and lib. XI, v. 299. 


1030 L. XXVI, 304-306. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2798-2804. 


1031 





But this passage is very beautiful and extremely 
comforting. For first of all, the word "breaker" 
contains the indication that there is a cross and 
obstacles, then also a certain salvation. As if he 
wanted to say: | give eternal life to weeping sheep 
and lead them to the right pasture, but this comes at 
a high price. For the way is not passable or prepared; 
many things stand in the way, which seek to hinder 
the elect, namely Satan, death, sin, the law; in short, 
the whole old Adam opposes it. But | will make it so 
that even though there are obstacles, they will not 
hold you up. | will send the breaker Christ before you, 
who will break through and take away every obstacle; 
he will prepare the way for you by taking away the 
power of the devil and death, so that afterwards the 
passage will be easy for those whom my spirit helps. 

By the way, as | said, this way seems to be very 
rough for the flesh. Therefore Christ says in the 
gospel of the kingdom of God [Matth. 11, 12], that the 
XXXXXXxX, that is, those who do violence, will snatch it 
to themselves, as the prophet says here: XXXX, they 
will also go to the kingdom of God. 
break through by the power of their leader. For the 
flesh must be killed and oppose the whole world and 
Satan, who seeks to hinder and stop us, that we 
should not follow this breaker. 

But in these difficulties Christ comforts us by 
saying [John 16:33], "Be of good cheer, | have 
overcome the world," that is, | have passed through. 
You shall 





break through to the kingdom of God under my 
guidance, so that it may be open to you, so that you 
may enter through the gate, that is, so that you may 
also lead others to the kingdom of God through the 
ministry of the gospel. Furthermore, it is not hidden 
with what force Satan sets himself against the 
ministry of the gospel. Therefore, it is necessary that 
those who are in the ministry of preaching are in truth 
breakthroughs who fear no unjust force, no dangers, 
but break through with great, steady courage. 

| have said above about the word "break through" 
that it indicates the cross, that one has to pass 
through thousands of dangers. Therefore, in stating 
that Christ is the or breaker, it indicates that he is a 
true Meush and wrestles with dangers as a man, as 
the struggles in death and on the cross testify. But 
because he overcomes these dangers, and through 
this victory establishes a people and a kingdom for 
himself, he is called our King. 

But the same is called here also "the Lord" 


(Jehovah), which name alone is attached to the true 
God. Therefore, those who study the Holy Scriptures 
must pay attention to this testimony, by which the 
divinity of Christ is certainly confirmed, as the prophet 
will also indicate the same in clear and undoubted 
words in the fifth chapter below. 

The prophet has woven this short sermon about 
our Savior Christ and his kingdom like a beautiful 
gemstone. Now he returns to his people. 


The third chapter. 


V. 1. And | said, Hear, ye heads of the house of 

Jacob, and ye paces of the house of Israel; ye ought 
to be just, that know the right. 
We have heard three sermons of the prophet. The 
first two preach about the punishments of idolatry and 
avarice. The third one is a consolation of the kingdom 
of Christ, which is as a 





Shepherd of the sheep will care for and govern his 
church. 


In this chapter, the fourth sermon is presented, 
which has the same content as the first two. 
However, because it is entirely concerned with 
punishing the outward vices, such as avarice, 
cruelty, and injustice, with which the princes and the 
priests afflict the people, the sermon is not intended 


1032 L. XXVI, 3N6-308. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 3, 1. W. VI, 2804-2808. 


1033 





If the text is not easy to read, there is nothing to hinder 
the reader except for the grammar, which is also easy. 
But this is a fierce sermon of which Jeremiah speaks in 
chapter 26, v. 18, and writes that it was preached by 
Micah in the time of Hezekiah, and yet he was not killed 
by Hezekiah because of it, while an ungodly king would 
have killed Jeremiah because of the repetition of this 
threat, if he had not been protected by the elders. But 
from this passage it is quite clear that even Micah was 
not without peril, but was safe only through the 
assistance of the good king. For tyranny not only cannot 
stand the truth, but also invents reasons why this 
freedom must be restricted to the teachers, as, 
unfortunately, there are all too many examples in our 
time that show that otherwise reasonably good 
authorities are annoyed by the truth. For what Aristotle 
has shown in a very beautiful fable happens, namely, 
that the lions do not like to have laws prescribed for them 
by the hares, according to which they are to arrange their 
counsel and their actions. Therefore, when the hares 
preach to the lions in godly zeal, they must either suffer 
the lions' claws with danger to their lives or bring their 
lives to safety by flight. 

Nowadays it is common in the courts to say that the frank 
sermons, in which the vices of the authorities are 
punished, are seditious. But if it is seditious to reprove 
the wrongs of persons in authority, | pray you, what shall 
we say of Micah, who not only said this, but also wrote 
and publicly signified that he dealt not with peasants, but 
with the very princes and heads of the house of Jacob 
and Israel? But it is a very impudent speech to call Micah 
and others who have done the same as Micah rebels. Is 
the truth, which is pleasing to God and especially 
commanded to the servants of the Word, a cause of 
rebellion? Scripture and experience abundantly testify 
that rebellion is a punishment inflicted by God. 





not for the sake of truth, which is commanded to the 
teachers, but because of the sins of the authorities, 
which must be punished for the sake of certain causes, 
not to be hidden or concealed; for such concealment 
awakens God to be an avenger of such sins and to bring 
them to light. 

First of all, since the authorities in a community are 
like the head of the human body, no medicine can be 
used for the rest of the body unless the head is healed 
first. For just as we in general exhort the great multitude 
to godliness in vain, if the authorities themselves do not 
care for religion, so the authorities, if they are properly 
instructed, of their own free will bring back the common 
people to a chaste life and the practice of virtue by 
severe punishments. Therefore, a godly teacher must let 
the authorities be his first concern, that he admonish 
them of their office, that he bring them away from the 
ordinary arbitrariness which they take upon themselves 
because of their power. | ask you, how can this happen 
if a teacher turns a blind eye to all sins and passes over 
everything with silence? 

Then what the satyric poet said is true: 


Omne animi vitium tanto conspectius in se 
Crimen habet, quanto major, qui peccat, habetur. 


[Every fault of the heart has a guilt in it that is the more 
obvious, the higher he is held who sins.] For as the 
person is a public one, so also the sins of a person in 
authority are public sins, and have a much greater 
importance than those of private persons, not only 
because of the annoyance that the mob is inclined to 


imitate the vices of the great (principum), but that the 
person in authority thereafter becomes more indolent to 
reprove and punish that in the subordinates which he 
finds in himself. But this is the tremendous evil that godly 
teachers, like Micah, must counter with all zeal. For how 
often does the Lord testify that he has been reconciled, 
as it were, through strict punishment of the wrongdoers! 
Where, therefore, the authorities in this matter do not 
fulfill their office 


1034 L. XXVI, 308-311. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2808-2811. 


1035 





the Lord himself, who is the judgement, is forced to 
exercise the judgement. But this almost never 
happens without a common calamity, as the prophet 
testifies in this passage [v. 12], that because of such 
sins of the rulers Zion shall be plowed up like a field, 
and Jerusalem shall be destroyed to the ground, that 
it shall be nothing but a heap of stones. 

Thirdly, this was the special profession of the 
prophets, that they faithfully proclaimed what the 
Lord had revealed by visions or in other ways. But 
even though this has almost ceased today, the 
example shows that God does not want the sins of 
princes to be passed over in silence. And in the New 
Testament it is a general commandment that 
repentance should be preached. But how can you 
preach this to the princes if you do not punish their 
manifest sins, which they commit to the great 
annoyance of their subjects? These and similar 
reasons exempt the prophet from the charge of 
sedition. 


V. 2 But you hate what is good and love what is bad; 
you flay their skin and the flesh from their legs. 


A beautiful image expresses the cruelty they 
exercised against their subjects. And the Germans 
use the same image when they want to express the 
utmost violence, for they say: "He flays his poor 
people to the ridge." 

This terrible picture shows how great a sin avarice is 
in the eyes of God. The authorities often think that 
even if they do wrong to their subjects, it is not a great 
sin if they extort a florin or two over the ordinary 
burdens. But here listen to the prophet, who in a 
frightening way makes this sin great, for he says that 
it is the same as if you flay their skin, as if you bare 
the bones of flesh, and as if you finally innhumanly 
break and crush the bones that have been bared. 
Dear, who will say that this is something small? Who 
will not consider this the highest tyranny and 
inhumanity? Therefore, this passage, if any in the 
whole of Scripture, contains the most grievous of all. 





Censure of avarice; not alone that it sets before us 
the exceedingly severe penalty, as will follow, but 
that it also makes the greatness of sin itself so 
frightfully great. 


v. 3. And eat the flesh of my people, and when ye 
have flayed off their skin, break ye their legs also, and 
cut them as into a pot, and as meat into a cauldron. 

He persists in the description of violent and 
tyrannical avarice, because in fact avarice is 
connected with tyranny and unjust violence. 

Furthermore, this detailed description of avarice 
and tyranny does not only serve the purpose that 
those who were in the secular and _ spiritual 
government at the time of Micah should mend their 
ways and turn their concern away from the increase 
of their private wealth and focus it on healing the 
church and helping it, but this is, as it were, a kind of 
revelation, which is also useful for our times, that 
those who are in authority, whether secular or 
spiritual, should know that this is also a temptation by 
which Satan wants to lead us astray and plunge us 
into sin, so that we may learn to flee both unjust 
violence and avarice with all the greater diligence. 

In our time, the splendor of the courts has grown 
inordinately. Since the ordinary income is not 
sufficient to pay for such great expenses, we see that 
the subjects are burdened with new and unusual 
treasuries. Although public dangers are being raised, 
everyone can see that the cause of such exactions is 
that the princes make greater expenditures than the 
means allow. Therefore, this sermon of Micah should 
be a reminder to godly princes that they should flee 
all occasions, that they should not abuse their power 
by force to suck their subjects dry. 

It is not very necessary to make an admonition 
about the clergy we have in our churches. For they 
are almost everywhere kept by their own so meagerly 
and filthily that they are far from all suspicion of 
avarice, for they have scarcely so much that they can 
afford to be 


1036 L XXVI, 311-313. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 3, 3. 4. W. VL, 2811-2815. 


1037 





and their own. And if, nevertheless, some seek 
opportunity to acquire goods, let them be mindful that 
they take account of their preaching ministry, lest they 
dishonor it by seeking their own or misuse it for gain. 

By the way, here the Pabst's crowd has its place, which 
in truth lives from robbery. For although they now boast 
of the rightful title of ownership, yet look at the 
beginnings, in which way they started to become great. 
If they had not made people foolish with ungodly and 
untruthful teachings, they would never have attained 
such great riches. And not even they themselves can 
deny that they are in no way useful to the church, unless 
we think that it is useful to the church that they keep 
whores, ride horses, feast, gamble, drink, and the like. 
But we will leave them to their master, who can kill the 
soul and cast the body into hell, for they do not hear us. 
If, however, there are some more decent people among 
them, it is to be wondered at if they are not troubled in 
heart when they see that such great goods are offered 
for idleness, and that they enjoy the benefice without 
rendering any service to the church. But now let us hear 
the punishment. 


V. 4. Therefore, when you cry out to the Lord, he will 
not hear you, but will hide his face from you at the 
same time that you have earned it with your evil ways. 


The prophets use to imitate Moses when appropriate, 
as this is also a Mosaic way of speaking, which is taken 
from the Song of Moses. But it means "to hide the face" 
or to turn away: to be angry, as on the other hand to show 
the face, to illuminate the face means: to look upon 
graciously, to be favorable and benevolent, as in the 80th 
Psalm, v. 20: "Let your face shine, and we will recover", 
because the right recovery is when he is favorable, when 
he loves and looks upon us graciously, according to the 
well-known saying of Paul [Rom. 8, 31.]: "If God is for us, 
who may be against us?" 

Furthermore, one must carefully note this text. He 
has above the so unjust and stingy 





The people were threatened with imprisonment and 
destruction. Since this is already something heavy in and 
of itself, he doubles the punishment here, since he also 
denies them all help in their misfortune. And _ this 
punishment actually refers to the impenitent, who, 
reminded by the word of God, still do not refrain from 
acting evil. In addition to the physical punishment, God 
will not hear them when they pray, because they do not 
want to hear God when He calls them to repentance. 
Thus, not only do they lose the goods they obtained 
through stinginess and impiety, and become involved in 
misfortune, but at the same time they also lose the 
promise of salvation; not only because God does not 
want to hear them, since they did not want to hear God, 
who preached and exhorted them in vain for so long, but 
also because they themselves, when they pray, made 
ashamed by their conscience, do not dare to hope for 
salvation. 

This cross is arranged for the stingy overlords, so that 
they shall have nothing to hope for in misfortune. For this 
is a hard judgment: "They will cry to the Lord, and he will 
not hear them. From where will they be able to ask or 
hope for help if the Lord does not look at them in their 
misfortune, but oppresses the oppressed even more like 
an angry enemy? 

We should think this and believe these threats, then we 
would be less willing to sin, and the fear of the Lord would 
drive the security out of our hearts. And there are 
certainly some who are moved by these prophecies and 
threats, although the greater part, captivated and 
senseless by their goods, power and air, do not believe 
this until they experience it. 

But | have said that the prophet threatens this to the 
impenitent, that is, to those who hear the word but do not 
obey it, and who sin surely until they are seized with 
punishment. For this is that he adds: "He will hide his 
face from you at the same time," as of such people who 
have done evil with their works, that is, who have not 
ceased from sinning until they were seized by God in his 
wrath with the punishments. 


1038 L. XXVI, 313-315S. Interpretations about the prophets. W. VI, 281S-2818. 


1039 





Therefore, this passage admonishes all overlords 
that they should not let their lusts take the reins and 
not be a burden to their subjects, but preserve justice 
and righteousness, otherwise it will happen that they 
will be overtaken by the utmost misfortune without 
any hope of hiding and will perish. 

Furthermore, so that | may also remind you of it, 
this is a saying of the Law that threatens certain and 
inevitable misfortune to the impenitent. Thus, 
Manasseh could not avert exile and captivity by his 
prayer, and yet, when he subsequently recognized 
his sin and asked for forgiveness, he was not cast out 
by God. So we too should believe that, although 
punishment cannot be avoided, the return to grace is 
open to all through repentance and faith, as the 
Gospel teaches. 


Thus saith the Lord against the prophets that 
deceive my people: They preach that it shall be well 
where they are fed; but where they are not fed in the 
mouth, they preach that war must come. 1) 


So far he has been talking about worldly 
authorities. Now he preaches about the prophets and 
teachers, who do not use their office for the 
blessedness of the people nor for God's glory, but for 
their profit. 

But here, too, he uses frightening imagery when 
he says that the godless teachers tear the people 
apart with their teeth. This does not only refer to the 
damage to goods that the audience suffers through 
the stinginess of the teachers, but even more to the 
damage to soul and blessedness. Therefore, they are 
called "wolves" by the prophets as well as by Christ 
himself and the apostles, who tear and tear apart the 
sheep commanded to their loyalty by seducing them. 

Furthermore, in it is a beautiful image that is 
added: "They cry out: Peace. But if someone does 
not give them anything in the mouth, against him they 
start war." The word "peace" is familiar because it 
indicates that the false pro- 


1) The Latin text to which the interpretation refers reads thus: 

Sic dicit Dominus contra prophetas, qui seducunt populum 

meum, eumque lacerant dentibus suis et clamant: pax. Si 

a autem non dederit eis, quod vorent, parant contra eum 
ellum. 





The prophets comforted the people against the 
threats of the holy prophets and promised that 
everything would go well and happily. But this, says 
the prophet, they did because they saw" that the 
people and the princes were pleased with such 
preaching. As therefore your Micah and_ his 
comrades hated the truth, so these were esteemed 
and held precious for the sake of the lie. For it has 
always happened that lying prophets were heard with 
pleasure and were pleasant to the people, whereas 
the godly and true prophets were not respected and 
had to suffer hunger and were hated, especially by 
authorities and princes. 

Furthermore, the Prophet's way of speaking must 

be noted at this point. For he does not say, as we 
have translated it, that they make war, but he says 
that they "sanctify" war, XXXXXX XXX XXXX as if 
one said: 
They do not fight with the sword against those who 
do not want to give anything (as the civil authorities 
do, who wield the sword); they have their special war, 
that they banish such people from the church, that 
they condemn them as heretics 2c. And they do this 
under the title that they are holy, that they are the 
church, that they are priests, Levites 2c. This way of 
speaking cannot be rendered quite clearly in Latin. 

This agrees very well with the artifices of the 
papists. For just as the false prophets exhorted the 
Jews to offer sacrifices frequently, and, overlooking 
all other sins, prophesied that all would be well if they 
sacrificed freely and often, so it has not yet escaped 
the memory of men with what efforts, with what 
artifices, the papists have induced people to buy 
indulgences, to decorate the churches. To pledge 
masses, as it is called. In all these things there was 
a very great gain. 

But if anyone spoke against it, or did not want to 
be persuaded of these things, tell me, were they not, 
as the prophet says here, waged war against, and did 
they not have to face certain dangers? If still today in 
the places where our gospel is condemned by the 
authorities, someone does not command that his 
deceased father or 


1040 L. XXVI, 315-317. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 3, 5-7. W. VI, 2818-2821. 


1041 





If a mother keeps a companion according to her 
ways, if he does not buy masses and other things 
customary in the papacy for a certain amount of 
money, he is immediately taken for a Lutheran, and 
the monks, the executioners’ slaves of the tyrants, 
are prepared for him. In this way, godliness always 
remains the same, even though there is a great 
disparity of manners and times. But what judgment 
will await these godless teachers and seducers? 
Certainly this: 


V. 6 Therefore your vision shall become night, and 
your divination darkness. The sun shall go down upon 
the prophets, and the day shall be dark upon them. 

That is, because the ungodly teachers abuse their 
office for gain, it will happen that they will be caught, 
and not only will they be found to have prophesied 
and taught falsely, but even if they want to teach the 
truth and desire to do so, yet they cannot. 

The contrast is well known, XXX means "a face", 
that is, the gift of divination, as it is common to call 
the prophets "seers". To this he opposes "the night", 
which shrouds everything in darkness and puts it to 
shame, so that it indicates the utmost blindness. 
Thus we see many who in the beginning not only did 
not dislike our doctrine, but were also considered by 
them to be the highest treasure; after these had 
united with the adversaries for the sake of greater 
gain, they could not but be blasphemers and speak 
and think of us in the most hateful way. This reward 
awaits those who abuse their service or office for 
their gain. This is one part of the punishment. 


V. 7. And the showers shall be put to shame, and 
the diviners to scorn, and must all cover their mouths, 
because there shall be no word of God. 

It is such a terrible blindness as the 
prophet threatens, and we see it today in the 
papist seducers, a great and _ severe 
punishment, but it is not small in that. Also 
shame and disgrace will accompany this 
blindness, that they, because it comes quite 
differently than they have promised, public 





can be convicted of the lie. Therefore, before the 
fulfillment, the false prophets can boast against 
Micah and comfort their own with the hope of 
success. But when the Assyrian had devastated 
Israel and brought his army to the gates of 
Jerusalem, the circumstances proved that Micah had 
taught the truth, but they had taught falsehood. There 
they were forced, as Micah speaks in a beautiful 
image, "to cover their mouths," that is, they did not 
even dare to protest, while before they had filled the 
temple and all the streets with their shouting. 

This image is also taken from Moses, who in the 
third book, Cap. 13, 45, says of a leper that he should 
cover his lips with his garment. And in German we 
indicate the shame with almost the same image 
when we say that a man who is convicted of lying 
does not dare to open his mouth or show himself 
before the people. And according to Roman custom, 
those who were convicted in court covered their 
heads. 

Furthermore, the last piece is especially 
remarkable, in which the prophet indicates the cause 
of the blindness and the falling into ruin. However, he 
uses a very delicate brevity: XXXXX XXXXX XXX 
XX, "for there is no answer. 
word of the Lord there", that is, because what they 
taught and promised was not the word of the Lord. 

He does not say anything about the office and the 
profession, because he concedes it to them, just as 
we do not refuse obedience to the popes and bishops 
today for the sake of it, as if they had no legitimate 
profession and office, since Paul [2 Thess. 2, 4.] 
expressly says that the Antichrist will have his seat in 
the church. And Christ says of the false prophets of 
his time [Matth. 23, 2.]: "They sit on Mosi's chair." 
Therefore the prophet allows the false prophets the 
office and the profession, and does not accuse these 
things, nor does he condemn them. But this he 
condemns, that although they are in office, they do 
not use the office rightly, because they teach, but not 
the word of the Lord, because they promise and 
comfort, but not from God's word. 

Now this falsity has been with the false prophets 
at all times, that when they have 


1042 n. xxvi, 317-320. interpretations on the. Prophets. W. vi, 2821-2825. 


1043 





they were accused of not administering their office 
properly, yet they protected themselves with the 
prestige of the office. For what else do the popes and 
bishops have today that they would like to oppose us 
with, but that they are in their profession and office? 
This, they think, is the reason why they can give us 
laws and why we should accept them. But we have 
never argued about the office. We punish the abuse 
of office, but they want to defend this abuse with the 
prestige of office. 

But who would not laugh at, yes, curse a prince 
who commits many unworthy and wicked things in the 
worldly regiment, and nevertheless wanted to excuse 
his sins afterwards by pretending his office? Should 
he not, because he is a prince, therefore have 
guarded himself against what his evil desire instills in 
him? For he is a prince for this reason, that he may 
do justice. If he does not do this, or even does the 
opposite, he is convicted by his own testimony that he 
does not do what is in his office, and cannot excuse 
himself by protecting his office. Thus it is quite 
inconsistent and contrary to common sense what the 
foolish papists do. Because they are in office, they 
want everything to be up to them. 

But we do not quarrel about the office any more than 
the prophet did, but the quarrel is about how the office is 
administered. For because they have no answer from the 
Lord, that is, because they teach, instruct and command 
everything without God's word, they are rightly punished 
by us; rightly we consider their reputation to be nothing, 
which we would hold in high honor if they held fast to the 
word and did not want to protect themselves against the 
word. Therefore, what is affirmed in Isaiah [Ilsa. 40:8]: 
"The word of God endures forever," the prophet 
expresses here in a negative way, namely, that where 
there is no answer or the word of God, there is nothing 
lasting or eternal, but blindness and falling away must 
follow, as Christ indicates in the beautiful parable of the 
house built on sand. It is true that ungodliness often has 
a glorious appearance, that it seems as if it could not be 
overthrown by any force; 





as it stood when we look back in thought to the form 
of the church. We can see that the masses and other 
ungodly ceremonies were so high that no one could 
have hoped for the present change. There we saw 
that the masses and other ungodly ceremonies stood 
in such high dignity that no one could have hoped for 
the present change. But because those ceremonies 
were performed without the Word, even against the 
Word, it happened that that house, when the storm 
of the Word and the wind of the Spirit broke in, 
became shaky and began to collapse at the bottom. 
For it is true: "God's word endures forever." 
Therefore, where God's word is not, there can be 
nothing permanent, even if it seems to be demant in 
appearance. 


V. 8. But! am full of power and the Spirit of the Lord, 
full of justice and strength, so that | may denounce 
Jacob's transgression and Israel's sin. 


This is a glorious contrast, in which the prophet 
not only praises his office and profession, but also 
the direction of his office against the false prophets 
and excellently adorns the right office of the word. 
Why it is used is clear from the well-known saying of 
Christ [John 16:8], where he says that the Holy Spirit 
will punish the world for sin, for righteousness and for 
judgment, so that people will not only learn to 
recognize their sin, but also obtain forgiveness of sin 
and righteousness through Christ, and with great 
courage despise the threats and rages of both Satan 
and the world. 

But the prophet has shown above how the world 
cannot stand the truth and the punishment of sin; 
therefore it rages with all kinds of tortures against the 
godly teachers, as the examples of all prophets, 
apostles and teachers show. But those who close 
their eyes and flatter the world are held in high 
esteem and are glorified. And there is a greater 
supply of such people at all times, because not all 
have such strength of mind that they can despise the 
hatred and rage of the world. Then they are also 
generally overcome by a brilliant life and by their 
desire for riches. 


1044 L. XXVI, 320-322. interpretation of Micah (1.), Cap. 3, 8-10. 


W. VI, 2828-2828. 1045 





These infirmities of the false prophets Micah very 
cleverly pulls off by setting his example against them 
and saying: "But | am full of the power of the Spirit of the 
Lord", that is, | do not bring my wisdom, | do not rely on 
my powers, otherwise | would be like you, who are full 
of the spirit of man, and are subject to temptation, since 
you, in order to obtain goods and dignities for yourselves 
and to gain the favor of the people, look through your 
fingers at the sins of the people. 

But the power of the Spirit of God, which dwells in 
me, proves itself in two ways, in "justice" and in 
"strength". "Right" means here, according to the usual 
way of the Scriptures, when the misdeeds that are done 
are punished and condemned, as the prophet interprets 
himself, since he adds: "I am so full of right that | may 
denounce Jacob his transgression and Israel his sin." 

But since justice is not without danger, because the 
world can suffer nothing less than that sins be punished, 
so also in this the spirit of God is shown, that | am “full 
of strength" and can despise those dangers. This is the 
glorious gift that Christ so often promises when he 
comforts his disciples, commanding them not to worry 
about what to say, even when they are led to torture 
[Matth. 10, 17. ff.], especially since they are not alone, 
but have the Comforter with them, who fills the hearts 
with all the more certain hope, the closer and more 
severe all dangers seem to be. 

The prophet says that he is full of this gift, so that 
even though everything is threatening, he will not 
deviate in any way from the commandment of the Lord. 
By this gift the apostles, even when they were 
beheaded, went away rejoicing that they had been 
worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ [Acts 5:40 
ff]. Although those who do not have this gift are very 
insolent apart from danger, yet they give way at the first 
struggle, and rather speak and do everything according 
to favor than to stand in danger because of the truth and 
to incur the hatred of men. But what the end of these 
people is, has been shown above, namely that the sun 
sets on them, that is to say, that they go into the 





The people of the world will fall into extreme blindness 
and finally also become disgraced. 


V. 9 Hear this, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and 
ye rulers of the house of Israel, who despise judgment, 
and pervert all that is upright. 


He returns again to reproaching the princes in the 
secular government, who, since they were supposed to 
be the guardians of justice, left the care of the 
commonwealth and the subjects to themselves, and 
cared only for their own advantage. Thus we have also 
said above that avarice is a peculiar snare of Satan, with 
which he pursues the rulers, so that they, lured by their 
advantage, throw away the care for the commonwealth, 
set aside justice, and oppress the citizens by unjust 
administration, who suffer injustice and must keep silent 
about it because of the power of the princes. 

But the Prophet has used very expressive words. He 
calls them XXXXXXXX, ver 
ous guardians of the law who see what is just and right, 
but let their lusts take the reins and do not want to do 


what they recognize, as the poet says: Sit pro ratione 


voluntas [Instead of a rational reason, let my will 
prevail]. 

Then there is also a beautiful contrast: "All that is 
upright you pervert" or corrupt. For it indicates that they 
are intentionally bent on not doing right just so they can 
get rich. 


V: 10. Ye that build Zion with blood, and Jerusalem 
with iniquity. 

The change of person is common among the 
Hebrews. Here, however, the participle nQ, which is in 
the singular, has the meaning of a collective noun. For it 
wants to indicate that each individual builds in this way. 

Furthermore, this is also a Hebrew way of saying that 
Zion will be built with blood, for it means that they will 
build magnificently, but from the sweat and blood of the 
poor, just as today- 


1) In the preceding, the verb in Hebrew was in the plural, but here 
it is in the singular. So instead of "person" it should actually be 
“numerus". 


1046 L. XXVI, 322-324. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2828-2831. 


1047 





An unusual splendor has broken out at the courts of 
all princes. The buildings are not the same, the 
clothes are not the same, the way of life is not the 
same as before; everything is decorated in the most 
exquisite way. But in fact the princes also build and 
decorate their courts with blood, because they load 
their subjects with new and unusual treasures, so that 
they are not compelled to give up anything of their 
splendor and magnificence: Glamor and_ their 
splendor to leave. In the past, the princes lived 
frugally, so they could bear the expenses without 
burdening the subjects, and in common need they 
had access to the goods of private individuals. But 
now, when the subjects are plundered because of the 
splendor, the princes leave themselves no help to 
avert common dangers. And in addition to this, there 
is a more serious harm, that through these unjust 
extortions the hearts of the subjects are also 
alienated from them, and the way is paved, as it were, 
for rebellion and other evils. But these are 
punishments for sins, which will be replaced and 
recompensed by other punishments. 


V.11. Their heads judge for gifts, their priests teach 
for wages, and their prophets prophesy for money. 

What he says of the princes serves to interpret 
what he said just before, "They build with blood.” For 
although the tyranny: defend their avarice with the 
blood of pious men, as Naboth was slain because he 
would not sell his garden to the godless king, and the 
tyrant seized the garden, yet this also means "to build 
with blood," or to circumvent, when the subjects are 
too much oppressed, and the princes do not 
administer justice equally, but, as the prophet says 
here, "judge for gifts," that is, when they award justice 
even in an unjust matter to those who give them gifts, 
but do not award justice even in the most just matter 
to those who give them nothing. 

But this is a very great folly, though it is very common 
in all courts. Well known is the saying of the very good 
prince Jehoshaphat, who, when he heard the 


After he had appointed the secular government and 
the church in the best way and had chosen suitable 
people, he admonished the secular authorities in the 
most serious way and said [2 Chron. 19:6]: "Watch 
what you are doing, because you are not judging 
men, but the Lord. All that ye shall therefore judge 
shall come upon you. This saying teaches that the 
power to judge is not human, nor is it merely 
commanded by men, but by God Himself. Therefore, 
for the sake of God and for the sake of God's 
commandment, this work of God should have been 
rightly directed. But, says the prophet, our princes 
not only do not look to God, but prefer gifts to God, 
to the commandment of God and to the work of God. 
Do you think that this contempt will go unpunished? 
Therefore, this evil will come upon you, so that you 
will again be despised and rejected, just as you 
despise and reject God's work and commandment. 

Furthermore, this does not only refer to the judges 
themselves or to the persons in authority, but also to 
those whose services are used by the authorities in 
the administration of justice, such as legal scholars, 
advocates, procurators and others of the kind. Since 
it would be their duty Since it would be their duty to 
defend justice and equity, they often defend unjust 
matters, tempted by a richer profit. Often they cover 
up good things and only confuse them more, 
because delaying brings them profit. Often they beat 
off the: Often they knock off the shell of the poor, 
even in good matters, when action must be taken 
against more powerful ones, because they look more 
to the favor and grace of men than to the 
commandment of the Lord and the direction of their 
office. 

But who could denounce all such deceit and 
trickery? Although nothing is more painful than to be 
defeated in a good and just cause because of other 
people's unfaithfulness or ignorance (for even the 
sinful ones who approach these trades while they are 
not yet sufficiently informed), nevertheless, because 
the judgment is the Lord's, one must keep silent 
about the injustice and leave the vengeance to your 
Lord, who in his time will demand severe 
punishments from the stingy despisers and 
perverters of justice, as the prophet will remind us at 
the end.

1049 





And their priests for wages 2c. 


Now the prophet also preaches against the 
spiritual authorities to show that he is full of justice 
and strength. But he also chastises them that they, 
infected by avarice, deviate from their office and 
have their profit in mind by setting aside the 
commandment of God. 

Some use this saying very clumsily against the 
godly teachers, as if it were not permissible to live on 
the salary that is set aside for the church servants. 
They cite the word of Christ [Matth. 10, 8.]: "For free 
you have received, for free also give." They also hold 
up the example of St. Paul [Acts 20:34], who, while 
teaching the churches, did not want to burden the 
churches, but earned his living with his hands. 

This, whether it be called a complaint or a slander, 
arises from a diabolical hatred of the ministry of the 
word. For what else do godless people do, who 
deafen the ears of the simple with such speeches, 
but that they bring into contempt not only the persons 
of the church ministers, but also the office of 
preaching itself, since one should rather take all care 
that the church ministers have their dignity restored 
for the sake of the honor of the Word. 

It is true that Christ says, "In vain have ye 
received, in vain also give." For he wants this to be 
the main purpose of the ministry of preaching, that 
the glory of God and the salvation of men be served. 
For it is because of these two things primarily that the 
ministry of the word is instituted in the world. But it 
does not follow that it is ungodly for the church to 
feed its ministers. It would be ungodly if the ministers 
of the church were to lose sight of the ultimate 
purpose of the ministry of preaching and look only to 
the reward, or if they were not to administer the 
teaching ministry properly for the sake of the reward. 
Therefore, just as a church servant is required by 
God's commandment to serve the glory of God and 
the salvation of mankind, so the congregations in 
turn have the commandment that they should feed 
the church servants. For so says Christ [Luc. 10, 7. 
Matth. 10, 10.]: "A laborer is worthy of his wages." If 
he is 





now worthy, no one need reproach the teacher for his 
wages, 1) as St. Paul explains this saying more 
clearly, 1 Cor. 9:14, saying, "The Lord hath 
commanded," or decreed, "that they which preach the 
gospel should feed on the gospel." But he adduces 
the office of the law [v. 13.], "They that sacrifice," he 
says, "do they not eat of the sacrifice? and they that 
minister of the altar, do they not enjoy of the altar?" 
He also uses other parables exceedingly suited to this 
trade, saying [v. 7.], "What man ever goeth to war 
upon his own pay? Who planteth a vineyard, and 
eateth not of the fruit thereof?" But especially 
remarkable is the glorious comparison which he also 
uses in the Epistle to the Galatians [1 Cor. 9, 11.]: "If 
we sow you Spiritual things, is it so great a thing 
whether we reap your bodily things?" [Gal. 6, 6.) 

As for Paul's example, he himself publicly testifies 
that he does this not because it is unreasonable to 
receive a living from the church, but so that in this way 
he promotes the course of the word and cuts off the 
cause of blasphemy that disgraceful people might 
bring up in a new cause. 

Therefore, as from all Christians, so above all from 
the ministers of the Word every suspicion of avarice 
and greed should be kept away. But this does not 
mean that it is wrong to accept from the 
congregations what is necessary for a sufficient living, 
as some take pleasure in these strange opinions 
because of the appearance of a special holiness. 
Some, out of undoubted ill-will and satanic malice 
against the preaching ministry, censure it because in 
some places, 1) where the congregations are able, 
more generous salaries have been decreed. 

For if we look to the benefit of the churches, we 
shall not rather declare ourselves in favor of keeping 
the ministers of the churches well, than that in many 
places they and theirs should scarcely escape hunger

can? For this barrenness deters the most gifted minds 
from the service of the church. For not all of them have 
the strength of mind and the constancy to accept only 
hatred and hunger for the very hardest work. And 
especially a "husband" can encounter nothing more 
difficult than to see his wife and children starving, 
whom he could feed splendidly if he took up another 
profession. For although access to the study of law 
and medicine is not open to all, because of the great 
expense; how many occupations can be performed in 
a community with all honors, even by an only 
moderately gifted person, all of which open the way to 
a brilliant life and wealth? Truly, young people will 
want to take these up, even for their own sake, rather 
than knowingly and willingly push their wives and 
children into beggary. 

Will not, therefore, a certain danger arise to the 
church from this barrenness which it shows toward the 
ministers of the church, since there will be a lack of 
skillful people, and it will be depressed by the unskillful 
and dangerous government of unlearned people who 
cannot aspire to anything higher? There are examples 
of this before our eyes, which show not only with how 
great darkness religion has been darkened by the 
government of unlearned people, but also with how 
great crudeness all good arts have been suppressed. 

Therefore, no one should take offense at the fact 
that in some places, through the godly zeal of pious 
princes, the servants of the church are kept somewhat 
more honest. On the contrary, we should all lament 
the fact that the majority of princes and secular 
regiments do not take care of their descendants, who 
will have either no leaders or completely unlearned 
leaders in the face of such great barrenness. A 
particularly grave and intolerable sin and judgment will 
come upon those who rob the churches and touch the 
goods of the church servants, as the unruly nobility in 
the countryside and the more powerful families in the 
cities are wont to do. For both of them, lured by the 
hope of a

small profit, the churches into certain ruin, which they 
should promote and adorn also by their generosity 
after the example of their, ancestors. 

But | return to Micah. He does not condemn the 
priests and prophets because they accept wages and 
money, for godly teachers deserve their wages. But he 
condemns them for misusing their preaching ministry 
for profit, for turning a blind eye to the sins of the 
people that they should have punished. Thus Balaam 
allowed himself to be bought by cursing those whom 
the Lord had commanded him to bless. In this way, 
says the prophet, the wickedness of this people should 
have been punished. But for the sake of profit, the 
false prophets even assist the sinners and promise 
them good things. 


Relying on the Lord, and saying: Is not the LORD 
among us? No evil can come upon us. 

This is a splendid passage, which is not only useful 
for the interpretation of the other prophets, but also 
contains, as it were, an excellent portrait of our 
adversaries. There is no one who, looking carefully at 
everything, would not wonder very much where the 
great certainty and obstinacy of the pope and his 
followers come from. They profess a doctrine that is 
flatly contrary to the teaching of the Gospel. The 
ceremonies that Christ Himself instituted, they have 
either corrupted or sullied with unrighteous additions, 
and put new ones in their place without a word of God. 
But it is not necessary to say anything about their life, 
because the higher they stand, the more 
unrestrainedly they sin, so that already before times 
the saying was true that the closer one is to Rome, the 
more distant is Christianity. 2) And yet, with such great 
godlessness, they fear far less than those whose 
doctrine and life are holier and better. Who should not 
wonder where this certainty comes from? 

Thus, the prophet sufficiently indicates how much 
his priests and prophets deviate from their office, since 
they look more at profit than 


2) Erlanger: Otn-istianidsinans instead of: Ouristianismu8.

1053 





They are not so sure of their office, and because of 
the money they overlook what they should be severely 
punished for by their office. And yet, he says, even 
though they are such people, they rely on the Lord and 
trust in his goodness. "Is not the LORD among us?" 
For we shall suffer no evil 2c. 

Furthermore, the same cause of presumption is on 
both sides, that the wicked, blinded by their hypocrisy, 
seize the promises and, trusting in them, despise all 
threats. Thus the Jews had glorious promises that the 
people and the kingdom should be preserved until 
Christ. Since the prophets were punishing the sins of 
the people and threatening destruction, they’ 
countered those promises. They boasted of their 
father Abraham, their office or profession, their 
worship and their sacrifices that God had instituted. 
Trusting in this, as in certain protection, they were 
safe from punishment. 

Thus, the church of the New Testament has 
glorious promises. But because the popes have 
seized the highest position in the church by force, they| 
think that everything that is always promised to the 
church is promised to them and their state. Therefore, 
even in the most extreme dangers, they have this 
word in their mouths, that the little ship of Peter may| 
be tossed about by the floods, but it cannot be sunk. 

In the same way, both the godless Jews and the 
papists deceive themselves. Not as if God does not want 
to keep His promises or to reject His people and His 
Church, but because the hypocrites, although they have 
the office, nevertheless abuse their office, and therefore} 
cease to be both the people of God and the Church, 
because the saying given above [Cap. 2, 7.] remains:. 
"My sayings are kind, but to the pious." Those who 
therefore do not walk righteously are not presented with 


so much weight that they could sin unpunished for 
this reason. Rather, the saying of the Gospel [Luc. 1, 
52] applies: "He pushes the mighty from the throne", 
and [Luc. 16, 15]: "What is high among men is an 
abomination in the sight of God. 

Here the examples serve that the firstborn are 
generally rejected people, as Cain, Ishmael, Esau. 
Thus the unbelieving synagogue with its sacrifices 
and even the temple were rejected, but the remnant 
are saved. In this way, Christ's Church, after the 
popes, the bishops and the whole army of the 
Antichrist have been cast out and rejected, remains 
small, despised in the world, oppressed, poor and 
disgraced. 

Therefore, the prophet's opinion is that the sure 
hypocrites blow themselves out with their office and 
usurp the promises, which are not given to those who 
are in truth God's people or the church, but with a 
condition, not to those who live without fear of God, 
even though they live in great dignities. The Lord was 
in the midst of His people at the time of Micah, but 
because of this He would not spare the ungodly 
transgressors; because of this He would not tolerate 
the ungodly abusing the holy preaching ministry for 
gain, and promising futile things to those who were to 
be converted to repentance by the threats of God's 
wrath. Since Satan set himself against the Son of God 
through arrogance, it did not help him that he was 
created as an angel. It did not help Judas, since he 
sinned, that he was an apostle. And shall our papists 
be allowed to sin with impunity because they are 
popes and bishops? Rather, they will have to suffer 
the punishments of which their impiety is worthy, and 
the church will be preserved even without these 


the promises, but with the threats that they will either popes and bishops, as the prophet now adds: 


mend their ways or perish in their sins. For with God there 
is no respect for the person. The popes and bishops are 
appointed to govern the churches properly. But since they 
do not perform their office, their dignity and the position 
they occupy do not count before God. 





V. 12. For your sake Zion will be cut up like a field, 
and Jerusalem will become a heap of stones, and the 
mountain of the temple will become a wild height. 

This is the prophecy for which Jeremiah, when he 
repeated it, would have been killed by the godless 
king if 


1054 IL. XXVI, 331-333. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2841-2846. 


1055 





had not the elders intervened and defended him with 
the example of Micah. For no blasphemy against 
God seemed so offensive to the Jews as that 
Jerusalem should be destroyed and the temple laid 
waste. For there were clear prophecies that this 
kingdom and people should be preserved and 
protected. Then, because the worship was bound to 
the temple, no one could say anything less credible 
than that God wanted to destroy and desecrate the 
worship that He Himself had ordained. Therefore, 
Micah undoubtedly incurred the hatred of very many 
through this sermon, and if 1) he had been without 
the care and protection of the godly king Hezekiah, 
he would have been killed by the godless, 
presumptuous people, because he no_ longer 
threatened only the sinners, as before, but even the 
Temple, which had been chosen by GOD Himself to 
perform the sacrifices. But as far as the grammar is 
concerned, the understanding is easy. For he 
indicates utter desolation and destruction, since he 
says that the city itself shall be plowed up like a field, 
and the mountain of the LORD, which then shone 
gloriously with sacrifices and services that GOD had 
instituted, shall become like the mountains that are 
in desolate and wooded places. But this saying has 
a great amount of the most important things in its 
wake. For here we see the severity of judgment and 
the greatness of God's wrath against sin, that those 
who live in sins without the fear of God cannot be 
saved by their power, by the dignity of office, nor by 
any privilege in spiritual things. For if the Lord 


1) Erlanger: stsi instead of: stsi. 


for sin's sake spared not his people, not the temple, 
nor even his worship: what then shall it be that we 
can hope to oppose the wrath of God? 

Therefore, all presumption must be discarded, 
and even we must not be presumptuous that we are 
Christians and baptized, so that we might sin all the 
more surely because of it. Not only will this not lessen 
the punishment, but it will only increase it for the 
impenitent, as Christ says [Matt. 11:23 ff] that Sodom 
will be judged more tolerably than those who have 
heard the gospel and seen the miracles. The Jews 
also had circumcision, the sign of the covenant and 
the seal of righteousness, they had the glorious 
promises of Christ, of the preservation of the 
kingdom and the priesthood. They trusted in what 
God had spoken 2c. [But after they had departed 
from the fear of God and abused these privileges in 
order to sin all the more unrestrainedly, they not only 
lost these gifts and this glory, but also perished 
themselves. 

Therefore, this sermon belongs to the doctrine of 
repentance, that we, each one among us, live in the 
fear of God and obey the word; otherwise it will 
happen that we perish. For God does not want us to 
be safe or to decay. He wants us to fear Him, so that 
we will not sin; He also wants us to put our hope in 
His mercy through Christ, not in our worthiness, 
wisdom or righteousness. Those who do not do this 
will fall all the more heavily, on a higher level of 
dignity they stand, and will be subjected to all the 
more terrible punishments, as the horrible example 
of the Jews sufficiently shows. 


The fourth chapter. 


Now the prophet moves on from the physical realm 
to the spiritual, that is, from the punishment of the 
wicked to the consolation of the saints, so that they 
may have something to comfort them in their 
common misfortune. 


and overcome those evils through the salvation that 
would come through Christ. For although it was a 
comfort that this captivity would come to an end ina 
certain number of years, still 


1056 L. XXVI, 333-33S. Interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 4, 1. W. VI, 2846-2849. 


1057 





few who lived until the fulfillment of this promise, for 
the captivity lasted seventy years. But this was a firm 
consolation for all, that they knew for certain that 
Christ's kingdom would be revealed, through whom 
forgiveness of sins and eternal life would be granted 
to all believers. And the first part was written by Isaiah 
in his prophecy [ls. 2, 2] from word to word, who, as | 
said in the beginning, was a contemporary of Micah, 
but Micah was the older one. 

But the reader must be reminded at the beginning 
to flee the dreams of the Jews, who transfer these 
spiritual promises to the bodily kingdom, and thus fall 
into double error. For in this way they lose both Christ, 
whose kingdom is spiritual, and the kingdom of the 
flesh, which they expect in vain. For as experience 
shows, day by day they sink deeper into misfortune 
and are forced to despair of their hope. 

Secondly, the deviation of the prophecies from 
each other must also be taken into account here, 
because of which 1) the wicked were annoyed and 
could not believe the right prophets. For as in 
Zechariah, in the seventh and eighth chapters, the 
miserable desolation of both the city and the people 
is first prophesied; for he says thus [Zech. 7:14], "I 
have scattered them among all the nations which 
know them not; and the land is left desolate behind 
them"; after which is added [Cap. 8:4, 5.], "There shall 
yet dwell in the streets of Jerusalem old men and 
women, and they that walk by sticks of great age; and 
the streets of the city shall be full of babes and 
maidens playing in the streets thereof": so Micah 
seems to be arguing with himself entirely in the same 
way, since he [Cap. 3, 12.] that the temple shall be 
like a wild height, and afterwards adds [Cap. 4, 1. f.] 
that the mountain of the Lord shall be exalted above 
all hills, that the heathen shall come running, and that 
a new word shall be proclaimed from Zion. 

So Jeremiah was sent to prophesy a certain 
desolation. And it had already come to this, that after 
the city had been destroyed by the 


1) Erlanger: Hui instead of: 





When the city was taken over by the Chaldeans, most 
of the citizens were led away captive. And still, when 
the situation was so desperate, he was commanded 
by the Lord to promise salvation. And as a sign that 
everything should be restored, the Lord commanded 
him to buy a field that the enemies had already taken 
possession of. This difference could not always be 
understood even by the godly, as we see in Jeremiah, 
who marvels at the counsel of the Lord, saying [Jer. 
32:24, 25], Behold, this city is besieged, that it must 
be won and given into the hands of the Chaldeans. 
And thou, O LORD, sayest unto me, Buy thou a field 
for money, and take witnesses thereto; if the city be 
given into the hand of the Chaldeans? 

This difference has appeared to godless people as 
a completely sufficient cause for which they did not 
believe the prophets. And yet the outcome shows that 
God did both. For He gave the ungodly into captivity 
among the Gentiles for 'sin's sake, and yet also 
preserved among the Gentiles the remnant and the 
holy seed until Christ was born, who was to establish 
a new kingdom and fulfill these promises, which are 
not bodily but spiritual, through the word of the 
Gospel. And at that time the scattered kingdom of 
Israel, together with the other nations, returned to its 
King Christ and was saved. 


V. 1. But in the last days the mountain on which the 
Lord's house stands will surely be higher than all the 
mountains, and will be exalted above the hills, 2) and 
the nations will come running to it. 


Because | have said that the prophet speaks of the 
spiritual kingdom, for the sake of which also the 
physical kingdom, which was destroyed by the 
Assyrians and Chaldeans, had to be restored, one 
must look not to riches, not to power, not to physical 
majesty, if one wants to find this kingdom, but to the 
word of the gospel; for where the gospel is, there is 
also infallibly Christ and the kingdom of Christ or the 
church. Since the latter is in the world, there must also 
be some 


2) In the original, as in the Vulgate, the following words are still 
added to the first verse. 


1058 L. XXVI, 335-338. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2849-2853. 


1059 





place where it began. Therefore the prophet names 
the mountain Zion, as also David does, when he says 
[Ps. 110, 2.]: "The Lord will send the scepter of your 
kingdom out of Zion." 

But he promises that this mountain Zion shall be 
fortified in such a way that it is higher than all 
mountains, and that it is as it were the head of all 
mountains. Now this cannot be referred to a physical 
place, as the Jews do in an inconsistent way, because 
the temple, which was rebuilt after the captivity, was 
by no means as glorious as the former one, so that 
even some wept, who had missed the former temple 
of Solomon, as the history in the first 1) book of Ezra, 
Cap. 3, 12, testifies. But although he mentions a 
physical place, this must be transferred to the spiritual 
realm, to the church and the word of the gospel, which 
was first taught in Zion, where the first church was. 

What he therefore says about the elevation and 
fortification of the mountain must actually be referred 
to the bodily place, which for the sake of the sins of 
the people is desolate and turned into a wild height. 
But the kingdom of Christ, or the gospel, is so fortified 
that no power can oppress or overthrow it, as Christ 
says [Matt. 16:18.], "The gates of hell shall not prevail 
against it." Not that it should always be glorious 
through miracles, which were necessary in the 
beginning for a twofold reason, namely, because they) 
were promised in the prophets, and the new doctrine 
had to be advertised to men as having a testimony 
from God, so that Christ might be known; but that it 
should always be victorious and triumphant against all 
its enemies. Therefore the prophet used the word 
XXX, which not only means to bring to pass, but also 
to confirm and fortify, so that the kingdom of Christ, as 
it is above all kingdoms, shall also remain, according 
to the saying [Isa.40, 8.]: "But the word of our God 
abideth forever." 

But in what is added: "And the nations will come 
here", the difference of this kingdom from other, 
physical kingdoms is shown quite nicely. For there the 
bonds of the laws and compulsion are necessary, 
because- 


1) In the Vulgate, "Nehemiah" is called the second book of Ezra. 





so that the people remain in their duty and do not 
cause any disorder. Therefore, weapons are 
necessary to keep the dominions and to defend the 
prestige of the princes, but in Christ's kingdom this 
care is not necessary. He has no need of weapons 
with which to force men; as soon as the word has 
begun to resound in the ears and hearts of men, men 
run to it of their own free will, or rather, as he says, 
forced by their will, and want to have a share in this 
kingdom, as Christ says [Matt. 11:12]: "The kingdom 
of heaven now suffers violence, and those who do 
violence snatch it to themselves." For what more 
joyful thing can be heard than that through Christ the 
Father is reconciled, sins forgiven, and eternal life 
given to us? Who would not wish to be made a 
partaker of such great things? 

Just as the rivers are not forced by anyone, but 
run over steep places by their own power, so the 
nations, as soon as this word is proclaimed, flow 
towards this mountain, that is, towards the church, in 
which the treasures of God's mercy are displayed and 
distributed to the believers through the gospel. For 
the word XXX comprehends in itself the likeness of a 
river that runs with great force over steep places, as 
the Hebrews therefore also call a river, from its course 
or downstream. 

Above all, the prophet wanted to show the 
difference between this kingdom and the kingdom of 
the law or Moses. For he is a teacher who uses force 
and can hardly squeeze out a small shadow of 
obedience with threats and many plagues. For we 
see what the law accomplishes; when it most 
compels and presses, it makes either desperate men, 
or presumptuous, or hypocrites. 

But the kingdom of Christ, as the 110th Psalm, v. 
3, beautifully says, has a willing people, who follow of 
their own free will, like sheep follow their shepherd. 
For they are attracted by good deeds, not by threats 
or angry words. For God is not angry for Christ's sake, 
but supremely gracious and merciful. Therefore, with 
such a barm- 


1060 L. XXVI, 338-340. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 4, 1. 2. W. VI, 2853-2856. 


1061 





They do not postpone the matter until they are forced, 
but their will and their own desire forces them, as 
Christ also says very beautifully in the Gospel [Luc. 
14, 21]. For since the people, 1) who are completely 
immersed in their doings and their lusts, despised the 
kindness of the most friendly host, he commands that 
the servants force the lame and the blind to the 
wedding and compel them to come in. 

But it is a wonderful forcing or coercion, if a man 
loaded with misfortune and hungry is forced to the 
richly occupied table. For has he not only this one 
desire, that he may satisfy himself with the poor 
Lazarus of the "fragments and remains"? Therefore, 
if we want to speak of forcing, it is such a forcing that 
they themselves do not desire anything else, that 
they cannot rest if they are not called to the so 
deliciously prepared meal. For there is the highest 
willingness to obtain this benefit, while Moses, on the 
other hand, can do nothing else with threats of any 
kind than that people do something for appearance, 
but the heart is extremely far away from what they 
do. Thus the prophets comprehend in one word the 
most important and longest sermons. 


V. 2 And the Gentiles shall go, saying, Come, and 
let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the 
house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his 
ways, and that we may walk in his highway: for out of 
Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD 
out of Jerusalem. 

The word "they will go" also signifies the highest 
willingness, without anyone's compulsion; as also 
that they call to one another, saying, "Come, let us 
go forth." This shows that the kingdom of Christ is a 
kingdom of grace, which all those who feel the 
burden of their sins accept with the greatest pleasure 
and willingness. 

But it is especially noteworthy that they say that 
they want to go "to the mountain of the house of the 
Lord and to the house of the God of Jacob". And they 
add the reason why they want to go in this way, 
namely so that the 


1) Erlanger: NoroiMs held: Nominss. 





The Lord himself teaches them his ways. Here the 
prophet points as with a finger that the kingdom of 
Christ shall be revealed in the last days; so he also 
wants us to look backward and see what the kingdom 
of the law was like. As if he wanted to say: Today all 
come from all corners of Judea at the appointed times 
to the mountain of the Lord and to Jerusalem, to 
perform their sacrifices there, to worship before the 
mercy seat, to eat the Passover there 2c. For all the 
worship was ordered toward Jerusalem and the place 
of the tabernacle alone; but in the last days, when 
Christ shall be revealed, then shall the nations and 
the Gentiles run to the mountain of the LORD, and to 
the city of Jerusalem, but for far other causes. For 
they will not sacrifice, they will not worship there, but 
there they will hear and be taught the ways of the 
LORD by the? The Lord himself. 

In this way, the prophet not only shows the 
abandonment of the services of the law and the 
sacrifices, but also teaches about a new word, of 
which men do not have any knowledge, as they do of 
the teaching of the law, but a teaching that is purely 
heavenly and hidden in the hearts of all men. For into 
whose heart has it ever come that we are blessed 
through the merit of Jesus Christ, who died for us? 
The Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath 
declared it unto us [Joh. 1, 18.], of whom the Father 
commandeth from heaven [Luc. 9, 35.], "This is my 
dear Son, him shall ye hear." 

Furthermore, that the law is implanted in nature by 
God, as Paul beautifully discusses [Rom. 2, 14. ff.], 
that there are also thoughts in the hearts of the 
Gentiles, by which either the evil deeds are accused 
or the good deeds are defended, it was also given 
beforehand by Moses and indicated to the Jews. 
Therefore, in the New Testament, Christ brings anew 
kind of teaching by which we are instructed about the 
forgiveness of sins and endowed with the Holy Spirit, 
so that we may walk in the ways of the Lord, believing 
the promises of Christ and resisting sin by the 
assistance of the Holy Spirit and being encouraged 
to obey God in all things. 


1062 L. XXVI, 340-342. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2856-2880. 


In this way the prophet here teaches of the church 
of the New Testament that it will have the Lord 
Himself for a teacher, who will teach it His ways, as 
is also said in the second Psalm, v. 6. f.: "I have set 
my king upon my holy mountain Zion." This king will 
proclaim the commandment, saying, "The LORD 
hath said unto me, Thou art my son. "2c. . This is a 
clear saying that the kingdom of Christ stands in 
teaching, as the prophets for this reason call the 
gospel a scepter, as the 110th Psalm, v. 2. does, and 
Ps. 45, 7. says: "The scepter of thy kingdom is a 
straight scepter." For he speaks of the word that is 
sure and firm, and cannot fail. 

But as the king is a teacher, it follows that the 
subjects of this king are hearers and disciples who 
must hear their king and never grow weary of 
hearing. For the gospel is a quite inexhaustible 
teaching, which we never hear without special fruit. It 
is also profitable for us to persevere in hearing this 
King of ours, especially since no time passes when 
we do not need either teaching or comfort or 
remembrance or even strengthening, both because 
of the constant attempts of our enemy, Satan, and 
because of the weakness of our flesh, and because 
of the various aversions with which we are plagued 
and enticed in the world. But there can be no firm 
comfort of heart against sin, the devil and death, if it 
is not drawn from the Word. 

The prophet therefore rightly remembers this first 
benefit of this kingdom and praises it, that the Lord 
himself will teach his own ways, and that according 
to this teaching it will happen that we walk in his 
ways. For Christ pours out his Spirit upon us through 
the gospel and is effective in us, so that, just as Satan 
works death and sins in his own, so Christ through 
his Spirit awakens and works in us faith, love, 
patience, and all the other virtues that obedience to 
the law of God requires. 

But it is also to be noted here that everything else is 
excluded (exclusiva). For just as those who listen to this 
teacher 


1063 


walk in the ways of the Lord, that is, after they have 
been born again through the Holy Spirit, fallen to God 
for the sake of faith, and their obedience is pleasing, 
it is impossible, if you do not hear this teacher, that 
you could boast that you are walking in the ways of 
the Lord. Your ways may be those of Franciscus, 
Dominic, Benedictus, that is, human ways, but not 
the ways of the Lord. 

All the greater must be our reverence, diligence 
and care for the word. For if we hold on to this, we 
have the ways of the Lord, and even though our 
weakness is great, the firstfruits of the Spirit will not 
be without all fruit. They will prove themselves by 
resisting the flesh and its lusts; they will awaken 
confidence in God's help in adversity; they will inspire 
the fear of God, lest we be secure in our well-being; 
they will kindle hearts to strive for harmony, for love, 
for patience, for forgiveness 2c. The prophet 
understands all this when he says: "the ways of the 
Lord", although, as | have said, with so much 
weakness of heart, this is also weak and often 
covered by sinful movements of the heart. 

But where the word is not, there, even if there is 
some discipline, still the ways of the Lord cannot be. 
And Satan stirs up the opposite movements in the 
ungodly; he fills the hearts with certainty and 
confidence from their own gifts. Therefore, when 
disaster strikes, there is no earnest appeal, but 
human help is sought, and other impulses worthy of 
such an author flare up: Contempt of the brethren, 
avarice, gluttony, greed, etc., although this is usually 
covered by the hypocrites with a peculiar appearance 
of godliness and apparent works. These are the 
devil's and man's own ways, on which all those must 
walk who either do not have this teacher or do not 
want to hear him. 

But what is the purpose of the reason added: "For 
out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the 
Lord out of Jerusalem"? Certainly for the purpose 
that we recognize the real cause why the peoples in 
such great 


1064 L. XXVI, 342-344. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 4, 2. W. VI, 2860-2863. 


1065 





number gather on the mountain of the Lord, and we learn 
to distinguish this word from the word of the law. For here 
again he puts all the treasures of this kingdom in the 
word. 

But he says it will be a different word than went out from 
Sinai through Moses. He says that the law will go out 
from Zion and the word from Jerusalem. If the Jews were 
not struck with foolishness and blindness, - does not the 
prophet here clearly show that this kingdom will not be 
bodily? For after that glorious sermon about the running 
of the nations to the heart, he says nothing else than that 
the Lord will teach, and the word, he says, will go out of 
Zion. 

But why does he promise a new word, if the one given 
by Moses is to be valid? It is true that the law is valid and 
must be valid in order to teach us about obedience to 
God in this life. But it not only promises nothing about the 
possession of the life to come, but also takes away our 
hope for it, since it convicts us that we have not done 
enough for God's will. From this arises the frightening 
danger of the heart, that after we have recognized the 
will of God from the law, we feel nothing but death and 
our damnation. Therefore, hearts are filled with despair 
and anger against God's judgment. 

It is therefore the highest goodness of God that he 
instructs us differently about his will through the gospel. 
In it, the forgiveness of sins through Christ is announced. 
The hearts that are frightened by the law accept this with 
the highest pleasure, praise God, admire His goodness, 
trust in His mercy, call upon Him in the name of Christ, 
and joyfully expect the promised eternal life. They resist 
Satan and the flesh. And they do all this through the 
teacher of this word which goes out to Zion. For this word 
is taught in such a way that the Lord also gives the spirit 
to it. 

Of these things Moses proclaims nothing at Sinai 
through the Law. He does show what to do, but because 
he does not give the Holy Spirit at the same time, he not 
only teaches this in vain, but also fills the hearts with 
doubt, despair and blasphemy, because they do not 
know what to do. 


see another law in their members, which contradicts the 
law of God and accuses them. Therefore Moses is a 
fearful teacher, whom the people flee, as the crowd at 
Mount Sinai was afraid of the frightening sight. But to this 
word, which goes out in Zion, the nations run in great 
numbers 2c. 

But there is a great emphasis on the words "law" and 
"the word of the Lord". For whenever the prophets praise 
this new kingdom, they look at the kingdom of the law in 
passing. But the Jews boasted immensely that they had 
the Law of GOD and the Word of GOD, as also the 
Psalm praises this advantage [Ps. 147, 20.]: "He does 
not do such things to Gentiles." And Paul says [Rom. 3, 
2.], "To them is trusted what GOD has spoken." 

This boast and this advantage, which the Jews at the 
time of the Gospel would misuse to despise the Gospel, 
is here rebuked by the prophet. As if he wanted to say: 
"You are gloriously exalted because you have the law 
and the word of God. But rejoice and rather boast 
because of the law and the word of God, which did not 
go out from Sinai, but which will go out from Zion. For by 
it you will not be taught what you should do, but your sins 
will be forgiven you, and the Holy Spirit will be given to 
you so that you can do what God has commanded. Even 
if this satisfaction or obedience is not complete but 
deficient, the forgiveness of sins will take away what is 
deficient, and yet this same obedience will be pleasing 
for the sake of faith in Christ. 

This "law" (which he calls "the law of the Spirit" for 
the sake of contrast, as Paul also calls the teaching of 
the Gospel or the faith that takes hold of the forgiveness 
of sins), this "word", he says, comforts the hearts, while 
the law of Moses, since it teaches what we should do, 
but does not provide the ability to do it, terrifies, torments 
the consciences, and kills. Therefore, if you want to 
praise the law, if you want to praise the word of God, 
praise the one that will go out from Zion. Now he will say 
about the fruit of the teaching that the Lord will teach in 
Zion.

V. 3. He will judge great nations and punish many 
nations in faraway lands. 


This the prophet adds, as it were, as an 
interpretation of the foregoing, to teach clearly that 
this kingdom is not in outward power or arms, but in 
word, and that the Gentiles belong to it. It was not 
uncommon even under the law for the Gentiles to 
come to Jerusalem, as Naaman, the queen of Sheba, 
and no doubt some neighboring kings, as the king of 
Tyre and others. But the prophet says here that it 
would happen that the king who would teach his 
citizens in Jerusalem would also teach the great 
nations and punish the strong Gentiles who were far 
from Jerusalem. That means, as Luc. 24, 47. says, 
repentance and forgiveness of sins will be 
preached xxx XXXXX XX XXXX, among all 
nations, but in such a way that it starts from 


Jerusalem. 

Furthermore, since Scripture says that the Gentiles 
will also be added to the kingdom of Christ, it not only 
rejects Moses with his worldly rule as a teacher unfit for 
eternal life, but also shows that the kingdom of Christ is 
a kingdom of grace and forgiveness of sins. For what 
else does "being a Gentile" mean than not belonging to 
God's people, being without law, living in sins, in idolatry, 
in godlessness? Since such people are therefore called 
to the kingdom of Christ, is not the kingdom of Christ in 
truth such a kingdom, in which no judgment is made 
according to works, but the forgiveness of sins is 
proclaimed by grace, for free, for Christ's sake? 

Paul also says [Rom. 3, 25. ff.] that the 

righteousness that is valid before God is 
revealed without the law, that is, that in the 
kingdom of Christ those who lack the 
righteousness of the law and are sinners are 
considered righteous, if they believe that for 
the sake of Christ their sins have been taken 
away. 
And this is "the mystery", as Paul calls it [Col. 1, 26.]. 
For when our hearts see their unworthiness, they 
doubt the grace of God; for if the sins of which we are 
conscious were not there, we would have confidence 
that God would give us 





is weighed. But this doubt must be countered by this 
saying that Christ preaches the gospel, that is, the 
forgiveness of sins, not only to the Jews, who have 
the righteousness of the law and are the people of 
God, but also to the Gentiles, that is, to those who 
are not God's people but miserable sinners. 

But the prophet uses expressive words when he 
says many or "great nations", because the word is 
there and "strong nations". For in this way he praises 
the power of the word, which of all things in the world 
is the most despised. And yet, if the Gentiles and 
nations, however great and strong they may be, do 
not believe this despised word, they will perish, as the 
saying goes [Marc. 16:16.], "He that believeth not 
shall be damned." By this danger the nations and the 
Gentiles are moved, and bowing their necks under 
the gospel, suffer that they may be judged, that is, 
that their sins may be pointed out to them and 
punished. They recognize them and believe that they 
are forgiven for Christ's sake. 

The prophet uses the word "judge" and "punish" 
at this point, like Christ John 16:8.: "The Holy Spirit 
will punish the world for sin, for righteousness, and 
for judgment," that is, in the Gospel men will be 
punished so that they will recognize that unbelief is 
the greatest sin, and will be taught to believe that 
forgiveness of sins is given for Christ's sake, and that 
they will firmly believe that Satan's tyranny is broken, 
so that he cannot harm those who believe in Christ; 
As the prophet also adds here about the fruit that will 
follow this judgment and punishment. 


They will turn their swords into plowshares and 
their spears into pruning hooks. No nation will pick up 
a sword against another, and they will learn to fight no 
more. 

The same is also written in Isa. 2, 4. But before | 
speak of the opinion of the prophet, the error of those 
must be punished, who have been in error for a long 
time.

new that Christians are forbidden the lawful use of arms, 
just as the Anabaptists not only consider it ungodly for 
war to be waged, but also think that it is praiseworthy 
holiness for someone to go about without arms and 
weapons. 

But first of all, it is clear that the prophet is not talking 
about the civil authorities here, but about the kingdom of 
Christ. Therefore, he leaves the rule of the secular 
authorities untouched, so that the common peace may 
be preserved, which the church also needs. 
Furthermore, peace cannot be maintained without 
weapons. And wars are waged for the purpose not only 
of preventing injustice but also of establishing a lasting 
peace. 

Therefore, if anyone is so ignorant of the Scriptures 
that he interprets this to mean that a Christian is not 
permitted to bear arms or to use them lawfully, he 
reverses the opinion of the prophet in a quite 
inconsistent way, for he transfers this saying from 
Christ's spiritual kingdom to the physical kingdom, and 
that against the revealed Scriptures, which interpret the 
duty of the authorities to defend their subjects against 
unjust violence and to preserve peace. Thus Abraham 
defended Lot with weapons, and the histories of the 
kings show that godly kings not only waged very great 
wars, but also that God prospered their counsels. And 
clear is the saying in John's sermon on repentance [Luc. 
3, 14], where he commands the men of war to be content 
with their military service. For he approves the lawful use 
of weapons, which is either permitted or commanded by 
the authorities; he does not command that weapons be 
thrown away. 

Therefore, the correct understanding of this passage 
is that the prophet speaks figuratively of the fruit that 
follows the proclamation of the Gospel among the 
nations. For after men have been admonished for their 
sins, and reminded of the wrath and judgment of God 
(for this is what the prophet said about judging the 
nations and punishing the Gentiles), they are also 
instructed about the remedy by which this evil can be 
countered, namely, the forgiveness of the sins of the 
nations. 





The forgiveness of sins acquired through the Son of God, 
who gave Himself as a sacrifice, or, as Paul beautifully 
says, that is, as a ransom with which our sins would be 
paid. 

This promise of the Gospel cancels the terrors of sin and 
the law and makes hearts calm. For they see that God is 
no longer angry with us because of the death of His Son; 
therefore they love God again, trust in His goodness, 
thank Him that He has freed us from death and sins 
through His Son; as Paul says the same thing without a 
picture, what the prophet wanted to say here in pictures. 
He says [Rom. 5:1]: "Now that we have been justified by 
faith, we have peace with God," that is, after the hearts 
have been convinced that our sins have been taken away 
by the Son of God, and God has been reconciled to us 
through His Son (for this is what Paul calls "faith"), so it 
comes about that people fear nothing of God, of whom 
they know that He is "reconciled," but they take comfort 
in His mercy and are of good cheer even in the cross and 
in dangers. Such peace is spoken of here by the prophet, 
through whom the hearts are freed from the fear of death 
and the judgment of God through the gospel of the Son 
of God, who was given for our sins. 

But since through the gospel all are made equal (for 
just as God has decided all things under sin, so He also 
wants to have mercy on 1) all), so from this equalization 
also follows the outward peace among the members of 
the church, and there also no longer remains the 
exceedingly bitter hatred that was there between Jews 
and Gentiles when the fence of the law was still standing 
[Eph. 2:14]. For why should a Jew exalt himself over a 
Gentile, or a Gentile over a Jew, since Jesus Christ, the 
Son of God, is the equal and common possession of all, 
since we are all baptized into the death of Christ and live 
in the hope of eternal life, which is to be obtained through 
Christ? 

Hence it comes that those who, before the knowledge of 
the gospel, have been 


1) Erlanger: enina instead of: "tiara. 


1070 L. XXVI, 348-351. Interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2869-2872. 


1071 





have used, as it were, sharp swords and poisoned 
arrows, now live in harmony with one another and use 
this holy harmony, as it were, as plowshares and 
sickles to cut and reap the noble fruits of faith, 
instructing others in righteousness and enticing them, 
through godliness and blameless living, to recognize 
and obtain the benefits which, as the Gospel tells us, 
the Son of God has shown us. 

Therefore the prophet adds: "No nation shall lift up 
a sword against another, and they shall learn war no 
more. That is, the highest union of hearts with one 
another will take place after people have known 
Christ in this way and their hearts are pacified through 
the forgiveness of sins. "They will no longer learn to 
war", that is, they will not only not harm others, but 
will render every kind of service to one another, 
assisting the brethren with counsel and action, and 
especially performing the glorious benefits of 
instructing the uninformed, warning the unwary, 
urging the weary, comforting the fearful, admonishing 
those in danger, strengthening the weak 2c. For 
these services must be constantly practiced in the 
church. 

Although this is not done by all in such a way 
because of the vexatious and sinful lusts of the flesh, 
and also because of the persecutions of Satan, but 
even the saints often stumble and sin, the Word 
always goes ahead as a lamp, as it were, exhorting 
and teaching, so that at least the faithful recognize 
their weakness and do not let it take the reins, but 
resist the evil lusts and kill their flesh. This constant 
exhortation of the word does not go off without fruit in 
the church, although these fruits are less 
conspicuous because of the weakness. 


V. 4 Every man shall dwell under his vine and under 
his fig tree without fear: for the mouth of the LORD of 
hosts hath spoken it. 

This, too, indicates the supreme tranquility of which 
the hearts resting in this preaching of the Gospel will 
enjoy. And yet seems 





The prophet's special advice was, first, not to name 
only one kind of tree, and second, to name trees that 
are extremely fruitful and are grown for their fruit 
alone, not for their shade or their beautiful 
appearance. For even in the church there are many 
kinds of offices and many kinds of functions, and 
there is no Christian who is not in his kind, as it were, 
a vine or a fig tree. 

They are different offices, teaching churches and 
wielding the sword, just as the vine and the fig tree 
are different species, yet both have their very 
beautiful fruits. 

A teacher by his diligence shows the will of God 
and the blessedness. The civil authority is the 
guardian of peace, protects the good, punishes the 
bad. How great is the diversity among those who are 
in the household. But if they are Christians, each of 
them has his noble fruits with which they help others. 
Then this is the care of all and of each one, that they 
spread the knowledge of God, that they raise 
themselves and others in dangers by trusting in divine 
help, that they call upon God, that they overcome 
present ills by the hope of future immortality, that they 
be patient, not revengeful 2c. In this way, each one 
has his vine and his fig tree full of the sweetest fruits 
in his state. 

And there is no one to frighten them. Not as if the 
world or Satan will not arouse very many dangers 
against them, but first of all, they will not be deprived 
of this trust in mercy and its right fruit, namely, eternal 
life; then, the more fiercely the temptations break in, 
the more ample opportunity there is to exercise faith 
by invocation, which has the certain promise of 
salvation and security of which the prophet speaks 
here. 

The little piece that is added: "For the mouth of the 
LORD of hosts has spoken it" is a confirmation of the 
so glorious promise of the kingdom of Christ, which 
was necessary because of the tremendous 
astonishment of the desolation and captivity of the 
kingdom of Judah. For it seemed not only to the whole 
nation and the religion of the 


1072 L. XXVI, 351-353. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 4, 4. 5. W. VI, 2872-2875. 


1073 





The prophet comforts the godly so that they will be 
undaunted in that common calamity and be comforted 
by the certain hope of the future kingdom of Christ. 
Therefore, the prophet comforts the godly, so that 
they may be undaunted in this common calamity and 
console themselves with the certain hope of the future 
kingdom of Christ, in which all who believe in Christ 
will obtain forgiveness of sins and eternal life, that is, 
supreme peace and safety; "for the mouth of the 
LORD of hosts has spoken it. 


V. 5 For every nation shall walk in the name of its 
God: but we shall walk in the name of the LORD our 
God for ever and ever. 


This piece seems to argue with the previous one. 
For how does what he said above [v. 2], that many 
nations and peoples will come, rhyme with what he 
now adds: that every nation will walk in the name of 
its God? But the prophet looks on the wickedness of 
Satan and the world. For just as at that time, when 
Christ was the herald of this kingdom, the godless 
Jews, the Pharisees, the priests, the kings were 
stirred up by Satan against Christ and the apostles, 
so it always happens in the world. Never has this word 
of the kingdom of Christ been preached without 
others opposing it, without others following other gods 
and another worship of God, as Christ also indicates 
when he says [Matth. 11, 5.]:""To the poor the gospel 
is preached." Likewise [John 15:20], "If they have 
kept my word, they will keep yours also.” 

Therefore, this piece serves to instruct the church 
about the offense and to warn them against it, 
because wherever this kingdom is in the world, there 
will also be people who do not want to follow this God 
and boast of other gods, another worship and other 
services; yes, that there will always be people who 
will condemn the true church, 1) as if it did not have 
[the right God. For so 2) does every people walk in 
the name of their God, that 


1) Erlanger: tam vakant instead of: aaivvakuvt. 
2) Erlanger: 8i instead of: 8ic. 


they judge that those who do not hold with them are 
ungodly, as today our adversaries condemn us as 
heretics, call us members who are cut off from the 
body of the church, 2c. because they are convinced 
that we are rejected by God, but that they alone have 
the true God and are the true church. This is a great 
annoyance, for first of all it is very painful to the godly 
hearts that the true doctrine is so blasphemed by the 
world, and secondly they are sometimes led to doubt 
by this certainty of the adversaries. 

Now that the prophet has warned about this 
danger, he adds comfort, saying: "But we walk in the 
name of the Lord our God. That is, if our adversaries 
boast of their gods, if they condemn, despise, and 
blaspheme God and our Word, let us in turn boast of 
our God, let us in turn condemn them, for we know 
that we have the Lord, who is Jehovah, that is, we 
know that we have the true God, but they are idolaters. 

Therefore, in this passage, the prophet gives the 
church the free confession that it should not be 
frightened by the judgment of the false church, but that 
it should first continue with great courage in the ways 
of the Lord its God, and then freely condemn those 
who do not agree with it. The church should be patient, 
humble and willing to serve, but only when it concerns 
(the Christians') own affairs. But when it is a matter of 
doctrine, of worship, of God Himself, then she must be 
proud and fierce, and freely, without hypocrisy, 
condemn all errors and defend what is hers. For this 
serves not only the glory of Christ, but also the 
salvation of the soul. 

For if the adversaries were to spread their 
teachings freely in public, without anyone condemning 
them, many more people would be deceived. But now 
that we condemn them and defend what is ours, since 
we also boast of the light of the Word that is with us, 
and according to Paul's example also curse the angels 
if they should teach otherwise, Christ will receive his 
glory and the efforts of Satan, who is not able to 
deceive so many people, will be nullified. 


1074 L. xxvi, 3S3-3SS. Interpretations on the prophets. W. vi, 2875-2878. 1075 





The prophet calls the church to this hopefulness 
and persistence and promises that those who have 
this Lord and walk in his ways, that is, those who 
follow and keep his word, will be forever and ever, 
that is, will remain the people of God, even after this 
life, forever. This testimony of the resurrection and 
eternal life should be well remembered. We should 
therefore recognize this treasure that the Lord has 
given us. Therefore, we should recognize this 
treasure that the Lord has given us after the kingdom 
of Christ has been revealed, and when we suffer in 
adversity, hold on to this glory of right doctrine and 
the hope of eternal life, and not respect those who 
follow other gods and other gods and condemn our 
doctrine. 


V. 6 At that time, saith the Lord, | will gather 
together the lame, and will gather together the outcast, 
and them that | have afflicted. 

So far he has said of the kingdom of Christ that it 
will begin in Jerusalem through the teaching of the 
Gospel, and he has also added of the Gentiles that 
they will join themselves to the King Christ. At that 
time, he says, when this will happen, there will be a 
lame woman somewhere who has been cast out into 
distant lands; | will also bring her to this kingdom and 
accept her. 

It is common in the prophets to use the name 
"woman" 1) to designate a generation or a people. 
This lame and rejected woman is therefore the house 
of Israel, of which the prophet says above in the 
second chapter [v.] that he will so cast out and scatter 
it among the Gentiles that it will no longer be a part 
of those who belong to the Lord; that is, that as long 
as the Mosaic regiment and worship still exist, it 
should not return to its land. 

But he calls it "the lame", whether it is because of 
the barrenness, because the women, whose hip 
bone is dislocated, are little capable to give birth, 
whether it is because the house of Israel (as also 
Elijah [1 Kings 18:21] speaks), after it had broken 
away from the kingdom of Judah, lived in constant 
idolatry, and did not walk rightly in the service of God. 


1) Erlanger: mulisrtzZ instead of: mulisri8. 


had ordered. And this name shows the cause of the 
calamity, that because of idolatry the kingdom of 
Israel is disturbed. 

Therefore, this consolation was necessary, so that 
even though their hope of returning to the Jewish 
people was cut off, they would still hear that they 
should not be excluded from the kingdom of Christ 
for that reason. Therefore, the prophet does not want 
them to look only at the present disturbance that the 
Assyrian will cause, but rather to look at the future 
gathering that the Lord Himself will bring, so that, 
gathered into the church, they will enjoy the promised 
seed and the eternal goods that are acquired through 
the seed for the church of believers. 

These are such great things that it was easy for 
the pious to bear the hardship of the present captivity 
and disturbance. For who, having the certain hope of 
eternal goods, should not easily suffer temporal 
things to be taken from him? But this was only a 
comfort for the believers. The majority, however, 
were the godless, who did not respect the promises 
of spiritual salvation and, out of lust for physical gain, 
not unwillingly united with the heathen, and thus 
perished in their godless nature. 

Furthermore, this passage clearly explains the 
darker sayings of other prophets about the 
restoration of the ten tribes of Israel. For since he 
expressly says that they shall be restored after the 
kingdom of Christ has begun in Jerusalem and the 
Gentiles have accepted the gospel, the restoration 
will undoubtedly be of the same nature as this 
kingdom is established, namely not bodily, as the 
Jews still dream, but spiritually, so that they too will 
believe your gospel, which is preached among the 
Gentiles, and become partakers of the benefits of 
Christ through faith in Christ. And according to this 
opinion, what follows must also be understood. 


V. 7 And | will make the lame to have heirs, and will 
make the outcast a great nation, and the LORD shall 
be king over them in mount Zion from henceforth even 
for ever. 


1076 L. XXVI, 355-3S8. Interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 4, 7. 8. W. VI, 2878-2882. 


It is not his will that they should gain power and 
riches. For just as the king of this kingdom was poor 
and laden with misfortune in this life, so all who 
believe in him will be poor and miserable in this life. 
Therefore, the Jews wait in vain for a fleshly reign. All 
the glory of this king and his subjects will be that they 
will live with their king forever. 

For in this passage there is first of all a glorious 
testimony that the head of this kingdom, Christ, is 
true God, for he attaches to him the name of the true 
God, Jehovah. 

Secondly, there is also a clear testimony of the 
resurrection of the dead and another life after this life. 
For if the Lord will be King over them, not only in this 
life, but forever, then they must indeed live forever. 
For GOD is not a GOD of the dead, but of the living, 
And why should a kingdom be so gloriously praised 
here over the dead, who are nothing? If it is a 
kingdom, it is a kingdom of the living. Just as it is 
therefore necessary that all men die once, so this 
kingdom has the power that in it the dead live again 
and do not die, as this is said more clearly in the New 
Testament [Joh. 11, 25.]: "He who believes in me, 
though he die, yet shall he live." Likewise [John 
3:15,j: "That whosoever believeth in the Son of God 
should not perish, but have everlasting life." This 
comfort he holds out to your forsaken and rejected 
Hanse Israel, so that they may be lifted up by the 
hope of these eternal goods and overcome the 
physical adversity they have earned with their sins. 

But whato0 is it that he says, "He will be king over 
them in Mount Zion"? Why does he mention a bodily 
place, if this restoration is only spiritual, and not also 
bodily? This is the reason why the Jews still expect a 
bodily restoration, since the prophets remember 
bodily places. And also the teachers fall into this 
fleshly delusion in some places. But if one listens to 
the words of the prophet 


1) Erlanger: yni instead of: yuia. 





1077 


it agrees quite nicely with experience. For the matter 
shows that Zion is disturbed and devastated from the 
bottom. Therefore, a physical restoration of the place 
and the people is expected in vain. 

Nor does the prophet speak of the physical Zion. 
For he speaks of such a Zion, which endures forever. 
Therefore, he does not speak of stone and wood, but 
of Zion, that is, of the people who believe the word 
that was first spread in Zion and thus become 
blessed. This people, this congregation of believers 
in Christ, is the eternal Zion, over which the Lord will 
be king. In the same way, the prophets elsewhere use 
the name Jerusalem for the people who believe the 
word that was first preached in Jerusalem. In this 
way, the prophets cut off, in the most careful way, all 
the inconsistent opinions of the Jews. But the blind 
people also do not see what they see. Christ says 
[Luc. 21, 33.]: "Heaven and earth will pass away", and 
still the blind people dream of an eternal place on 
earth. 

And here it is also not inappropriate to chastise the 
blasphemous insolence of the papists, who in the so 
great light of the Word still do not cease to defend the 
primacy of the pope, that the pope at Rome is the 
head of the church on earth. But the prophet 
expressly says: "The Lord will be king over them on 
Mount Zion, full zero to eternity." He remembers 
Mount Zion to allude to a nation or church on earth. 
This will have no other head than the Lord Christ, for 
he has not left his church in such a way that it should 
need another, a governor. He has servants in his 
church; he does not have lords and kings. Therefore 
it is anti-Christian that the pope arrogates this dignity 
to himself, and quite ungodly that he defends it. For 
the godly follow the rule of Christ [Matth. 20, 25. f.]: 
"The worldly kings rule over the people, but it shall not 
be so among you."

Here he returns to the kingdom of Judah. Because 
this was also to be desolated by the Babylonians and 
the people led away captive, he also comforts them 
so that they do not despair of the so glorious kingdom 
of Christ. 

But he calls the kingdom of Judah "the tower of 
Eder" according to the figure of the synecdoche, 
because the tower of Eder was in the tribe of Judah, 
as can be seen in the first book of Moses Cap. 35, 1) 
21. However, it is customary to name the whole after 
a part, as large countries often get their name from 
small towns. Furthermore, "Eder" means a herd. 
Therefore, according to the secret interpretation, this 
name also fits the kingdom of Judah, in which the 
temple and the service of God were, to which the 
people were gathered, as it were, as herds at a 
certain place. 

And for the sake of this cause he puts the epithet 
to it: But it means 
Ophel actually means that which is hidden, as it were, 
under mists and cannot easily be seen, as if you said: 
dark or shrouded in clouds. This name fits very well 
to the church, whose gifts are very high; but they are 
hidden by weaknesses and aversions, so that they 
cannot be seen with the eyes of the flesh. That is why 


the church is rightly called the holy one (alma), the 
veiled and hidden one. 

Others take after the figure of Metalepsis 2) the 
word XXX for fortification or protective defense, and 
this is not inappropriate. For as far as the prophet is 
concerned, he does not speak of the stones of which 
this tower was built, but of the supreme gift of this 
people, that they had the word and the service of God, 
and the place of worship which the Lord Himself had 
appointed. Other fortifications, power, wealth, 
however great they may be, perish and are often 
harmful to those who possess them; but the 
knowledge of God, the Word, the right worship, where 
these are, men are safe from spiritual wickedness. On 
the other hand, where they are not, everything is full 
of the greatest dangers. So much for the grammar, 
now let us see the opinion.

The people were in for a terrible devastation. So 
that they would not despair completely, he comforted 
them that they should not judge according to the 
present appearance, because all the adornment, 
which was both in the secular government and in the 
priesthood, would be taken away by this disturbance. 
But here, he says, is a temporal adornment, which 
must also cease, therefore do not be very distressed 
for its sake. But there is a spiritual and eternal 
ladornment, which is due to this kingdom; look to it, 
land in the hope of it forget the temporal adornment. 

But this adornment is "the former dominion" or the 
former kingdom of the daughter Jerusalem. As if he 
wanted to say: Until now you have had no real 
kingdom. When you look at wealth, power and other 
things, the kingdom was flourishing under David, 
Solomon and several other kings. But what kind of 
kingdom was it, since everything was entangled by 
death, stained by sins and oppressed by God's wrath? 
But when Christ will come, only then will come the 
right adornment and the most noble reign, which 
nothing equaled before. For death will no longer reign 
lover you, sin will not accuse you, Satan with his 
tyranny will not be hostile to you, but you will be free, 
because the Son has made you free. Therefore he 
ladds: 


Vv. 9. Why then do you now cling to other friends? 3) 
Is the king not with thee? and are all thy counselors 
gone, that thus woe hath come upon thee, as one in 
childish trouble? 

This is an exhortation added to the promise. He 
sees that the people are so bowed down by the fear 
of captivity and calamity that they forget all the 
promises. Therefore he admonishes them not to do 
so. Sorrow seizes you, he says, like one in childish 
distress. Therefore you cry out as if the king of whom 
| speak were not among you, and as if this Counselor 
were gone from you. But you 





3) Instead of this first phrase (in our Bible), the Latin has, "Why are 
you crying out so miserably now?" This is what the interpretation refers 
to.

do evil to it. He will truly come. Therefore, do not let 
this hope be taken away from you. 

But this piece serves to teach us about our 
weakness in danger. For just as, when there is no 
danger and everything is well, hearts fall into security, 
so we despair and despair as soon as danger comes| 
For we think that God is angry with us, rejects us, and 
no longer cares for us. For it is true what David says 
[Ps. 116:11], "All men are liars." For in temptation wa 
are so overwhelmed by thoughts of God's wrath that 
we forget almost all of God's promises. 

But here the prophet ascribes the name of a 
"Counselor" to the King Christ, as also Isaiah Cap. 9 
6. does, because even when He allows us to be 
afflicted, He provides counsel for us so that we do not 
perish. But since the Jews were led away captive 
they thought that they had lost God as their Counselor 
and were being led away among the Gentiles without 
any hope of help. Therefore, the prophet reminds 
them that their hearts should fight against this doubt 
in the time of trial, because their King and Counselor 
cares for the Church. 

He also reminds us that we should refrain from 
relying on human help in times of danger, for this 
would take away the name and honor of Christ the 
King. For then we ourselves would have to be our own 
counselors, if we had no other counselor. Since Christ 
the King has the name of a counselor and is ours, why, 
do we follow or try other counsel? For if we have to 
trust in advice or help, who should not trust first of al 
in the advice of this eternal and almighty Counselor? 

But these counsels have a different appearance 
than the counsels of the world. The counsels of the 
world seem to be glorious and infallible, because they| 
are based on things that reason sees and 
understands, on wealth, power, wisdom 2c. But the 
counsels of this king, as well as his kingdom, are 
weak and lack all outward appearance. 





For God saves his own then, if he has let them plague 
before. Then he raises up, if he has pushed down 
before. Then he makes just, if he has accused before 
in the conscience. That is why the world flees from 
this counselor and would rather rely on wealth and 
power than on the word. And yet experience shows 
what Christ says [Luc. 21, 33.], "Heaven and earth 
shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away." 
For those who rely on this counsel will be preserved 
and saved, as the example of the Jews in captivity 
and the whole history of the church teaches. 


V. 10. Suffer thou, O daughter of Zion, such 
affliction, and croak as one in childish distress. For 
thou shalt go out of the city, and dwell in the field, and 
come to Babylon: but thou shalt be delivered from 
thence; there shall the LORD deliver thee from thine 
enemies. 


This also belongs to the comfort that he predicts 
the captivity so certainly. For unavoidable 
misfortunes are borne more easily. Therefore he also 
uses the simile of a woman in childbirth, not only to 
indicate the greatness of the danger and the pain, but 
even more to awaken the certain hope of salvation 
1). For when a woman is seized with birth pains, what 
do these pains indicate but that the fruit is now ripe 
to come forth from the womb of the mother into 
another life? Therefore, these pains do not indicate 
death, but a twofold life, that both the mother is to be 
freed from this burden and a new man is to be born 
into the world. 

This, says the prophet, is how you too should 
think; you will be afflicted and ill-treated by the 
heathen. Therefore, you will groan and suffer. | 
certainly do not hinder this, for | see that it is 
impossible not to bear sorrow in the highest woe, but 
there must be a measure in this sorrow. Captivity is 
certain; but do you hope, as in a birth, that a certain 
fruit will come forth?

will follow. Therefore, make an effort to give birth, 
that is, accelerate with hope and prayer the 
forthcoming change that your Nath-giver will bring 
about, do not let your courage sink 2c. 


V.11. For many nations will almost rise up against 
you, saying, "She is banished; let us see our delight 
in her. 


Just as the prophet had previously indicated how 
the people would judge when disaster struck, 
namely, that they would despair and look for human 
help, and he comforted the people against this, that 
the Lord was the Counselor who would strike in such 
a way that he would save again, so he shows in this 
passage how the Gentiles will judge the Israelite 
people who are thus afflicted, and he also comforts 
his own against such a judgment of the Gentiles. 

He says: "It will happen that strong and many 
nations will gather against you, and then there will be 
no sign that you can expect help from them. Rather, 
it will happen that they will rejoice over your 
misfortune. They will judge, as it is true, that you are 
suffering the punishment of your sins, that you are 
defiled and rejected and abandoned by God; 
therefore they will prepare to destroy you, but you will 
wait for something better. 

The 137th Psalm also preaches about this 
attitude. For the neighboring nations also take 
pleasure in the extermination of this people, and the 
enemies mock the captive Jews, as they say [Ps. 
137, 3.]: "Dear, sing us a song from Zion." For this is 
always the fate of God's people, that Satan cannot 
satisfy his hatred, unless he also mocks them in their 
highest calamity, as the godless Jews mock Christ 
as he hangs on the cross, crying [Matt. 27:46 ff.], 
"Eli," and saying, "Let us see if Elias will come and 
help him." For this is what the world is wont to do: 
when the time calls for mercy, comfort and help, it 
adds cruelty, mockery and scorn. This, says the 
prophet, will also happen to you, but do not be 
offended by it. 

It is in the words: "Our eye will be 


see" is a Hebrew way to redeu, because it means to 
see with joy and to have pleasure in seeing. 


V. 12 But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, 
neither perceive his counsel, that he hath gathered 
them together like sheaves in the threshingfloor. 


Here he starts to comfort his people against the 
mockery and the malicious intentions of the Gentiles. 
You will not be plagued by chance, nor will 
everything turn out as the godless heathen now 
think; for the Lord also has his thoughts and his 
counsels. You must look to these, not to your own 
judgment or that of the godless heathen. It seems to 
you 1) and to the heathen that you are now being 
brought in heaps like sheaves to be threshed on the 
Babylonian threshing floor. But believe me, the 
counsel of the Lord is different, that the Gentiles 
should be gathered like sheaves, and that you should 
thresh them. 

And this is, as it were, a general teaching that we 
should follow carefully in all temptations and 
dangers. For in every challenge, the first thing is that 
we think that we are rejected or abandoned by God, 
and that God will allow everything to the lust 2) of our 
enemies and of Satan. Against these thoughts the 
prophet comforts us, and teaches that no temptation, 
no calamity will come without the certain counsel of 
God. For God does not afflict us in order to repay us 
according to our sins, for otherwise He would not 
impose corporal but eternal punishments and 
calamities, for in truth our sins deserve eternal 
punishments; but in order that He may counsel us. 
For he is as the prophet called him above, or a 
counselor. 

But what is this counsel? Certainly, that God may 
call us to repentance in this way, so that we may 
recognize our sins, convert and amend, and God 
may save us again, and thus His name may be 
glorified. 

Therefore, in every challenge, we should first look 
at our life and our conduct. That which is not good 
should be improved;

W. VI, 2891-2834. 1085 





God reminds us of this through misfortune, so that we 
may correct it. But people generally do the opposite. 
First of all, they continue in their sins, so that their 
misfortune increases daily. Then they seek another 
way of salvation, namely help from men, while God 
interprets misfortune with the intention that we 
recognize our sins and mend our ways, and, saved 
by the Lord, give thanks to His name 2c. 

Furthermore, this prophecy is usually interpreted 
of the kingdom of Christ, that through the apostles the 
Gentiles were threshed, that is, brought to the 
obedience of the gospel and of faith. But because this 
prophecy has its place below, where he prophesies 
of the head of this kingdom that it should be born in 
Bethlehem, this seems to be more correctly related 
to history, namely that the captive Jews in Babylon 
will bring the Gentiles to the right knowledge of God 
and the right worship through the Word. 

Thus, through a miraculous event, Daniel became 
known in the court of King Nebuchadnezzar, and 
through him and other godly people, the knowledge 
of God was spread throughout the kingdom, as the 
decrees existed by which the king called all subjects 
to the service of the true God. The same happened 
with his son EvilMerodach. For if he had not 
considered the God of the Jews to be the true God, 
he would not have freed their king from prison and 
kept him royal. 

At the time when Daniel is in Media, he instructs 
Darius and Cyrus to godliness. And there is [Dan. 6, 
26.] a glorious command which Darius issued 
because of the God of Daniel. But Cyrus has glorious 
testimonies of godliness, both in Isaiah and 
Jeremiah. And this is a wonderful work that he did, 
that he let the captive Jews go and contributed to the 
costs of the building of the temple, Ezra 5:14 f. Thus 
the godliness of Artaxerxes is gloriously praised, who 
wants that prayers are made for him and his kingdom 
in the temple, and spends great goods on the building 
as well as on the sacrifices, Ezra 7:11 ff. 


This is the threshing, of which he says that the 
Lord thinks on it, to which the Jews would never have 
come if they had not been scattered among the 
Gentiles in this way. Therefore, a great change 
occurs here. At home, where they had the temple, 
they had sinned in many ways; therefore they suffer 
the punishment of ungodliness and are led into exile. 
In the exile, however, they worshipped God and did 
the most holy works, not with sacrifices, for that was 
not permitted outside the Temple, but by sanctifying 
the name of God and spreading His kingdom by 
instructing others in godliness and righteousness. 
This is the comfort he wants them to remember when 
they are led away captive, and he tells them to be 
fearless, as follows: 


V. 13. Therefore arise and thresh, O daughter of 
Zion, for | will make you horns of iron and claws of 
brass, and you shall smite many nations. 


He looks at the custom of threshing that the Jews 
had. For they did not thresh the grain with flails, as 
we do in Germany, but, as still happens in Italy and 
other foreign nations, they used draught cattle. 
Therefore he says: You are my ox, which | will arm 
with iron horns and with brazen claws. The brazen 
horns are necessary, so that they are not tired and 
not worn out by the leakage of the grain. 

It indicates the power added to the ministry of 
teaching among the Gentiles, that they will not teach 
in vain, but as they are wont to say: A weary ox puts 
his foot down the stronger. Thus they will press and 
tread down the Gentiles in such a way that much fruit 
will come from it for God and man. 

But what need is there of iron horns for threshing, 
since the ox alone uses its hooves for this purpose? 
The strength of the ox is in the horns. Therefore, it 
indicates confidence and unbroken courage in those 
who will teach among the Gentiles; as this was an 
excellent strength of Daniel's companions, that they 
would not worship before the image for the honor of 
their God [Dan. 3:18]. It 


1086 XXVI, 366-368. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2894-2899. 


There was also great courage in Daniel to remind the 
king of the future punishment and to teach him about 
it. LIkKewise, he punished the wicked Belshazzar. The 
Lord Himself gave these iron horns to the threshing 
ox, so that many nations would be crushed, namely 
those who had gathered against Zion. 


So | will banish their goods to the Lord, and their 
possessions to the ruler of the whole world. 
The prophet sees beautifully everywhere how he 
opposes the thoughts of the frightened with suitable 
and appropriate remedies. The pious feared that in 
such a long time, which they had to live in captivity, 
everything would be absorbed in paganism. But the 
Lord promises that also the Gentiles will come to the 
knowledge of God. They also feared that, since they 
had been robbed of their possessions, they would 
never be able to restore the temple and the city. But, 
says the Lord, even in this | will provide for you. Let 
the heathen rob you of your goods according to their 
desire; let them heap up riches for themselves out of 
the robbery. For many are piling up these goods so 
that your descendants may have something from 
which to rebuild the temple. Thus shall 


1087 


Ezra Cap. 5, 13. ff. the command of Cyrus is 
mentioned, And above we have also said about the 
generosity of Artaxerxes Longimanus. Also 
Josephus remembers other kings, who generously 
helped the Jews, so that they could raise the costs 
for the annual 1) sacrifices. 

Here, however, the princes are reminded of their 
office, that they should also help the needy churches 
according to their ability. And this passage of the 
prophet testifies that those who do so are moved to 
do so by God. For thus says the Lord: "I will banish 
their goods to the Lord." It is truly a divine work that 
Cyrus, Darius and others promote the service of God. 
On the other hand, nowadays the majority of princes 
interfere with the goods given to the churches, and 
misuse them for buildings, for the payment of robber 
warriors and other unholy things - who can doubt that 
they are ruled and driven by Satan? It is useful for 
them that the parishes either lie desolate or are 
administered by such people who do not understand 
their office and for that reason live contentedly in any 
position.

The fifth chapter. 


Cap. 4:14 But now, thou warrior, prepare thyself: for 

they shall besiege us, and smite the judge of Israel 
with the rod upon his cheek. 
The prophet has preached gloriously about what will 
happen after the captivity. Now he returns to the 
prophecy of the calamities that will take place before 
these good events occur. As if to say, "| have said 
that you will be lords of the Gentiles and will take 
them captive, so that they will leave their idols and 
worship with you the one and true God. But before 
this will happen, you will have to fight. For the enemy 
will come and take Jerusalem 





and it will happen that the judge of Israel will be 
beaten on the cheeks, that is, he will be treated 
shamefully. For the opinion is to be rejected, as if he 
prophesies here of Christ, who was beaten by the 
soldiers of Pilate with cheek strokes, as Jerome and 
Lyra interpret it. 


Here the prophet, as it were dismayed by the 
misfortune of the captivity, turns in a transition to the 
more cheerful preaching of the kingdom of Christ. He 
says: "It is a great thing that the captivity will be the 
occasion for the Gentiles to turn from idols to the 
kingdom of Christ.

true God and promote the service of the true God 
with their possessions. But this is not enough for the 
goodness of God; He will shower you with even 
greater goods. For that you may have a certain 
testimony that God will not forsake you, but will 
restore you to your fatherland, hear what He has 
decreed: The despised and small Bethlehem, which 
is nothing compared to Jerusalem, will not perish, for 
from it the duke of my people will be born to me, who 
will be a duke forever. 


V. i. And you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are small 
among the thousands in Judah, from you shall come 
to me the one who is Lord in Israel, which has been 
from the beginning and from everlasting. 

As to grammar, | do not dislike that the word XXXX 


is interpreted adverbially by little (parum), so that the 
opinion agrees with the evangelist who says [Matt. 
2:6.], "Thou art by no means least among the princes 
of Judah.” But then the text will have to be translated 
thus: Bethlehem Ephrathah, it is little that thou art 
among the thousands of Judah. For he speaks in 
Mosaic manner of speech. For as the Romans had 
the centurions into which they divided the people, so 
the Hebrews divided them into thousands. And it 
does not contradict that the Septuagint translated: xx 
XXXX XXXXXXXX, among the princes. For the Hebrews 
also call XXXXX XXXX the princes over thousands, 
just as the Latins call the centurions of the 
centurions. 

But even this is not inappropriate if taken 
adjectivally, for this does not injure the reputation of 
the evangelist, who wished to follow the Septuagint 
translation, not the Hebrew text, as the other 
apostles do, almost throughout the New Testament, 
certainly not without definite intention. 

But the Hebrew text has a contrast at this point, if 
one looks at the thoughts of the captives. They knew 
that Jerusalem was desolate and in ashes, so they 
had nothing to hope for from the rest of the land, for 
the kingdom of Samaria had already been invaded 
by the Gentiles. 


taken. They had to fear the same for the kingdom of 
Judah. But the prophet comforts them against these 
thoughts. Bethlehem, he says, is a small place 
compared to Jerusalem, and yet | will not allow it to 
perish or be taken by the Gentiles. It will remain the 
property of the people, and will remain so until he 
who is to be the prince of my people is born to me in 
it. 

This saying also serves as a model for the church. 
Christ is not born in Jerusalem, but in the small and 
lowly Bethlehem. In this way, the true church does 
not have great titles, not riches, not high dignities (not 
many noble and wise according to the flesh are 
called, says Paul (1 Cor. 1, 26.), "but what is foolish 
in the sight of the world, that God has chosen"), but 
is rather despised, poor, rejected, yes, oppressed by 
cross and sorrow, so that we must consider the word 
of Christ to be true JJoh. 18, 36.]: "My kingdom is not 
of this world." 

But that he gives Christ anew name and calls him 
XXXXXX XXXX seems to have been imitated by the 
angel Luc. 2, 11. when he says to the shepherds: 
"Christ the Lord is born to you today". And the 
apostles also in the same way call Christ everywhere 
the Lord or the Ruler. For itis he alone who rules over 
death, sin and the devil, as he preaches John 8:36: 
"If the Son makes you free, you are free indeed." 

The following piece: "Which origin has been from 
the beginning", is to be especially noted. For as the 
other pieces that follow indicate the ministry of Christ, 
so this piece paints the person, so that we may 
recognize of which Lord he speaks. Now as to the 
sense, it agrees entirely with the words of John [Cap. 
1, 1.], "In the beginning was the Word." Likewise, 
John 8:58: "Before Abraham was, | am." Col. 1, 15.: 
"He is the firstborn before all creatures.” For the word 
XXXXXXX, which we have translated by "origin," 
need not be adulterated according to the manner of 
the Jews, so that it means: promised from eternity or 


from old age. It means the essence (substantiam) 
and the being (esse) itself, that he was there from 


1090 L. XXVI, 371-373. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2W2-2S05. 


1091 





Eternity ago, before time or any creator. For this reason 
Paul says emphatically [Gal. 4, 4]: Born in time of a 
woman, to indicate that he was before time. Likewise 
[Rom. 1, 3.]: After the flesh a son of David, to indicate 
that he was there before he took on this flesh. 

Here, therefore, he first distinguishes this or Lord not 
only from all men, but also from all angels. For there was 
a time when neither man nor angels were, but at that 
time this Lord had his beginning, and did not begin to be 
only then, when he began to be in the flesh. 

But this serves to strengthen our faith. For who is not 
amazed at the exceedingly great things that Christ has 
accomplished through the Word alone, as_ the 
evangelists tell us? These things are impossible for a 
man or a creature, but they are not impossible for him 
whose origin is from eternity. For to him (although he is 
a creature according to the flesh) all creatures are 
nevertheless subject as to their Lord. 

But this also serves to instruct us about our life. For 
since the head of this kingdom is eternal, we too must 
strive for the eternal, not clinging to the world, but living 
as if we were outside the world, as Paul exhorts in the 
letter to the Colossians [Cap. 3, 1.]: "If then you have 
been raised with Christ, seek those things which are 
above. This would befit the subjects of this king. For it is 
certain that those who set their mind on the world and on 
temporal things are not Christ's servants. 


V. 2. But he will afflict them until the time that she 
who is to give birth will give birth; then the rest of his 
brothers will return to the children of Israel. 


Almost everyone interprets this saying of the spiritual 
birth, that through the gospel preached by the apostles 
among the Gentiles, a new church was born among the 
Gentiles. But there is nothing to prevent "she who is to 
give birth" from being understood simply by the holy 
virgin who conceived by the Holy Spirit and gave birth to 
Christ in this world. 


has. For the prophet shows a special emphasis and 
indicates a special birth, the like of which has never been 
in the world, nor will be. So also Isaiah Cap. 7, 14. uses 
the same word: "A virgin shall conceive and bear a son, 
and shall call his name Immanuel. 

Therefore, this is the opinion: Before this blessed 
birth happens, the people will be plagued in many ways 
by the successors of Alexander, by the Romans, by 
Herod. But this bodily adversity will be made up for when 
"she who is to give birth", that is, she of whose birth the 
Holy Spirit prophesies, has given birth. For then it will 
happen that also "the rest of his brethren," that is, the 
remnant of the ten tribes of Israel, "will return to the 
children of Israel," that is, that they will accept the 
gospel, believe, and be saved. This seems to be the 
simplest and the correct conception, which also includes 
the other one, that of the spiritual birth. 

But the prophet reminds us here, silently, of the order 
of God's works, namely, that he is wont to afflict before 
he comforts, and to oppress before he saves. And to 
those who are afflicted by misfortune, this reminder is 
necessary, so that they not only do not despair when 
they feel the adversity, but then also raise themselves 
up and draw certain hope that God will help them, and 
show His power and His goodness in the highest 
dangers. The flesh, however, tends to do the opposite; 
when everything turns out as desired, it has good hope, 
but when fortune seems a little unfavorable, it dreams 
that God is angry and that doom is at hand. 

Therefore, the prophet clearly reminds his people that 
before this promise is fulfilled, they will be afflicted in 
many ways, so that they will not despair in tribulations, 
as if the promises of Christ were not to be fulfilled. But 
our nature requires such an order of God's works, so that 
we do not become secure, so that we are not puffed up 
by prosperity, but live in the fear of God and exercise 
ourselves in faith and prayer.

teaches about the ministry of this Lord and says at the 
beginning: "He will appear" to indicate that he will not be 
idle like those who lie idle and snore. What then will he 
do? "He will feed." What this is can easily be seen from 
the New Testament, since Christ says [John 10:12], "I 
am a good shepherd." Likewise [John 21:17], "Feed my 
sheep." For the office of a shepherd has a wonderful 
resemblance to the office of Christ. 

A shepherd does two things, as we have shown 
above [Cap. 2, 12]; he feeds and defends. Thus Christ 
shepherds through the word, since he teaches that God 
is favorable to us, forgives our sins, and wants to give 
us eternal life through the Son. The defense is truly 
admirable, since he throws himself into the jaws of Satan 
and, as he himself says [John 10:12], lays down his life 
for his sheep. 

But he does this in strength or "in the power of the 
Lord", that is, by divine power. Therefore, the Christ who 
is killed lives, the one who is conquered conquers, the 
one who is oppressed oppresses, the one who is 
captured captures. For it was impossible, as Peter [Acts 
2:24] says, that he should be kept in the pains of death. 

But not only in the power of the Lord, but in the 
glorious and triumphant name of the Lord, his God. 
Truly, a wonderful way how the Lord administers his 
kingdom here. He feeds in the power of the Lord, and 
yet not with weapons, but he simply overcomes in the 
name of his God. This is indeed the highest thing in this 
kingdom. But what shall we say that the name of God is 
other than His word, for this is the true pasture, which 
was not revealed by Moses, but by Christ, as the saying 
says [John 1:18]: "No one has ever seen God. The Son, 
who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared it to 
us." 


But this is a glorious name, that is, it triumphs and 
overcomes, as Christ says [Matt. 16:18.], "The gates of 
hell shall not prevail against it," and Isaiah [Cap. 40:8.], 
"But the word of our God endureth for ever." 

However, we are reminded of the danger in this, since 
this king is held up to us that he is our shepherd. For who 
does not see the danger that threatens the sheep from 
the wolves and other wild animals? Thus our weak nature 
has Satan for an enemy, who walks about like a roaring 
lion and eagerly seizes every opportunity to harm. But 
with us there is so little protection against this enemy that 
a sheep in the midst of wolves seems to be much safer 
than we are. 

What should we do, therefore, so that the enemy does 
not gain the victory? Certainly this, one must take hold of 
the name of the Lord, that is, the word of Christ must be 
accepted in faith, and thus we will gain the victory. If sins 
afflict you, hear Christ commanding that repentance and 
remission of sins be preached in his name [Luc. 24:47]. 
If death is imminent and terrifies you, hear Christ [John 
11:25]: "| am the resurrection and the life: he that 
believeth in me shall never die." If the judgment and 
wrath of God terrify thee, hear Christ saying [John 3:16], 
"God so loved the world, that he sent his only begotten 
Son." Will you then be afraid of Him of whom you hear 
that He so loved you that He gave His Son? In this way, 
our Shepherd Christ goes before us, feeding and 
sustaining us in the name of His God. In this way he also 
speaks in John Cap. 17, 12: "While | was with them 1) in 
the world, | sustained them in your name. Which thou 
gavest me" 2c. 

Therefore the prophet also adds here, "And they shall 
dwell," XXXX that is, they shall sit securely, as Paul also 
says Rom. 5:1, "Therefore having been justified by faith, 
we have peace." However, not only is there no help in 
ourselves, but. 


1) Erlanger: graut instead of: graru. 


1094 v- XXVI, 375-378. Interpretations on the Prépheten. 


W. VI, 2908-2912. 1095 





Our enemy also overcomes in that when he accuses us, 
he never accuses in vain, for we too must confess our 
sins and that our nature is utterly depraved. 
Nevertheless, we dwell securely for this reason, because 
we have such a shepherd who feeds us with such great 
zeal, diligence and care, yes, with such great power. 
Therefore, the prophets rightly praise this kingdom so 
much, and we also set everything back against the Word; 
as Peter says [John 6:68.], "O Lord, whither shall we go? 
Thou hast words of eternal life." For there is no victory 
over death, no victory over sin, except in the name of 
GOD, in which this Shepherd feeds, that is, in the name 
of Christ, in whom alone hearts are at rest, as He says 
[John 16:33.], "In me ye shall have peace." Likewise 
[Matth. 11, 29.P- "You will find rest for your souls" 2c. 
But because safety is promised only in the name or 
word of GOD, it follows that if one departs from the word, 
all must be full of unrest and danger, as Christ says [John 
16:33.], "In the world ye fear, but in me ye have peace." 
For this is connected with each other: Peace and security 


in the word, which faith grasps, and hope (Sp€s) holds 
fast, and in the flesh dangers, cross, sin, trepidation 2c., 
against which faith in the saints fights on and on. 

What is added: "For He will become glorious at the 
same time, as far as the world is", first of all makes a 
great contrast between the times of the Law and the 
Gospel. For in the time of the Law, the Lord became 
glorious only among His people and within the borders of 
the Jewish land; all the rest of the Gentiles did not know 
God, did not have the Word, did not have the service of 
God. Therefore, they did not make the true GOD 
glorious, but their idols and their godless nature. This, 
says the prophet, will cease, for the glory of the LORD 
will be spread throughout the whole world. For by the 
gospel God is known; this gospel, he says here, will be 
spread into the whole world. 

Therefore, it follows, first of all, that the pagans have 
to go to the 


The kingdom of Christ is to be called. Secondly, it follows 
that this kingdom is a kingdom of grace, not of merit or 
works. For how else could the Gentiles be called to it, 
who not only lack all merit, but are also stained with the 
most grievous sins? And this is what Paul says [Rom. 3, 
21. 22.], that the righteousness that is valid before God 
is revealed without the help of the law, through faith in 
Christ. 

But how will he become glorious? For it is not only 
certain that Christ Himself was treated in the most 
unworthy manner by His own, but also that all believers 
have the same fate, for [2 Tim. 3:12]: "All who want to 
live godly in Christ JEsu must suffer persecution." But 
this does not mean "becoming glorious." It is therefore 
more in accordance with the truth that the enemies of 
Christ and the gospel become glorious, but Christ and 
his gospel are blasohemed, condemned and subjected 
to torture. 

| answer: The saying of Christ is well known: "My 
kingdom is not of this world. Therefore it follows that the 
glory of this kingdom is different from that which the 
kingdoms of the world have. In the world that is called a 
glory which stands in riches, dignity, power 2c. But 
Christ's kingdom has another glory, namely that it is not 
only in one place or at one time, but everywhere and all 
the time. There has not been such a great power in the 
world that has not been compelled to give place to the 
Gospel, as the Psalm says [Ps. 19:4, 5]: "There is no 
speech nor language where its voice is not heard. Their 
cord goes out into all the earth, and their speech to the 
end of the world." 

Furthermore, just as the. Just as rain never goes 
without fruit, especially when the fields are thirsty, so it 
is with the word that it is never taught without fruit. But 
those who accept the word in faith, with them the Lord 
also becomes glorious, for they would rather lose their 
goods, their lives and the whole world than deny Christ 
and let him be snatched away. The words of Paul are 
well known, the sermons of the prophets are well known, 
with which they adorn and praise the goods of this 
kingdom. 


1096 L. XXVI, 378-380. interpretation of Micah (1.), Cap. 5, 3-5. 


But, you will say, not all believe; the greater part are 
ungodly, blaspheme the gospel, and persecute it: where 
then is the glory which you extol? But here this glory is 
most conspicuous, for there is no power so great that it 
is not compelled to yield to this kingdom. The riches, the 
power and the rage of the world are clear in the day; but 
behold the end, and thou shalt know that the word of God 
abideth for ever, and is as a rock. [Matth. 21, 44.:] 
"Whosoever falleth upon this rock shall be broken: but 
upon whomsoever it falleth, it shall break him in pieces." 
This is also prophesied by Daniel, Cap. 2, 44, for he says 
that the stone which falls from heaven without the hands 
of men and crushes gold, silver, brass, iron and clay is 
the kingdom of Christ, which will crush all the kingdoms 
of the world. 

But this glory began immediately at the time when it was 
promised that the seed of the woman would crush the 
serpent's head. For everything that has opposed Christ 
and the word of God since that day has perished. Thus, 
one kingdom after another has been destroyed. And 
finally it will happen that also the miserable remains, 
which Daniel compares to feet made of earth, brass and 
iron, will be completely crushed by our King Christ. 
Before this general crushing, the special crushings of the 
furious princes take place, whom the long peace, wealth 
and happiness make nonsensical, as we see that some 
have fallen, who thought that they alone would be 
sufficient to eradicate our doctrine. But as the Psalm 
says of Jerusalem [Ps. 47:5], Kings have seen her, and 
passed by: so the enemies of the church have perished, 
and shall perish; but the church shall be preserved. This 
glory of the Lord in the whole world, in the believers and 
also in the enemies of the gospel, the prophet praises in 
this passage. 


V. 4. 5. For this also shall we have peace before 
Assyria, which is now fallen into our land, and hath 
trodden down our houses. For there shall be seven 
shepherds and eight princes over him. 





W. VI, 2912-2915. 1097 


be awakened, who destroy the land of Assyria with the 
sword, and the land of Nimrod with their bare weapons. 
So we will be delivered from Assyria, who has fallen 
into our land and trampled our border. 


It is not necessary that we change [in the first words: Et 


hic erit pax] the pronoun in the masculine into the 
neuter. For if it is understood of Christ that he is peace, 
then the same opinion that is in the Gospel [John 14:27, 
16:33] is: In me you will have peace, but not that which 
the world gives. For this peace is that we know that our 
sins are forgiven us, and that we are saved from eternal 
death, through this King Christ. This peace softens the 
troubles, dangers, troubles and all the troubles of the 
flesh. 

As for the rest of the text, Assyria is known. But "the land 
of Nimrod" is the Babylonian kingdom. For these two 
kingdoms did the most harm to the Jews. The Assyrian 
Salmanasser led away the ten tribes of Israel. The 
Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar led away the tribe of 
Judah. 

Although Lyra and others refer this to history, that the 
power of the Assyrians as well as that of the Babylonians 
was transferred to the Medes and Persians, yet, since 
we must necessarily understand the following from the 
kingdom of Christ, why should we make an unnecessary 
transition here? | now hold that by the Assyrians and 
Babylonians are meant the enemies in general, which 
the church has had at all times. For just as the people of 
Israel suffered these enemies, so the church must also 
suffer its enemies. 

Against these, he promises, seven shepherds and eight 
princes shall be raised up from among the common 
people, that is, a great multitude of teachers. For this is 
a Hebrew way of speaking, by which a great multitude 
and a great number are indicated, as also Solomon 
speaks in Ecclesiastes, Cap. 11, 2: "Divide out among 
seven and among eight," that is, give abundantly, not 
scantily. So he says here: The church will have a great 
multitude of evangelists, who will teach among the 
Gentiles, and either humble them, that they may give to 
the Pre-.

For those who oppose the word must perish by arms, as 
we have said above. For those who oppose the word 
must perish by weapons, as we also said above. 

The word comes from which means to set as ruler, to 
decree 2c. Therefore we have given it by "raised up" to 
indicate the apostles, who were chosen from among 
people of the lowest estate to teach and rule the world 
by word. The same word is used by David in the 2nd 
Psalm, v. 6: But "I have appointed my King”. For the word 
has a peculiar power to indicate the commanding of the 
ministry of preaching. 


V. 6 The remnant of Jacob shall be among many 
nations, as the dew of the Lord, and as the droplets of 
the grass, waiting for no man, nor for men. 


This has the same opinion as the previous one, although 
the images are different. He has said of seven 
shepherds and eight princes, who by the gospel will 
destroy Assyria and Nimrod, that is, all the enemies of 
the church. 

Here he uses another simile to indicate both the 

dignity and the fruit of the preaching ministry in the New 
Testament. For he compares the rest of Jacob among 
the nations, that is, the apostles and their successors in 
the preaching ministry, with the dew from heaven and 
the rain. This must first be related to the dignity of the 
preaching ministry, for the gospel is a heavenly gift that 
far surpasses all other gifts, as the Baptist says [John 
1:18]: "No one has ever seen God. The only begotten 
Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared 
it unto us." Rightly, therefore, it must be preferred to all 
things. 
Then the similitude must also be related to the fruit of the 
preaching ministry. For just as the earth is refreshed by 
the dew from heaven and by the rain, and everything 
grows and prospers, so a certain fruit follows the word, 
just as Isaiah uses this same simile in the same way 
(Cap. 





55, 10.]. The fruits of this heavenly gift are the Holy 
Spirit, who descends into the hearts of men through the 
word of the Gospel and awakens faith in them. Through 
faith, the forgiveness of sins and eternal life are 
obtained, as Christ says [John 6:40, 8:51]: "He who 
believes in me will never die. 

Furthermore, the Holy Spirit is not idle in the hearts 
of believers, for He contends against the flesh, killing the 
flesh with its lusts, and inciting to obedience to God. But 
since this can never be perfect in the weakness of our 
flesh, hearts are straightened daily by the Holy Spirit 
against this weakness and other sins, through faith, that 
is, through confidence in the mercy shown for Christ's 
sake. 

But just as the prophet says that the grass, which is 
refreshed by dew from heaven and fruitful rain, waits for 
no one, nor puts its trust in man (for dew and rain are not 
man's, but God's and truly heavenly gifts), so these fruits 
are sought in vain by the efforts, undertakings and works 
of men. There is only one way to attain them, namely to 
keep to the Word and to be obedient to it. The efforts of 
the monks in the papacy are well known, through which 
the simple-minded people believed they could attain 
these fruits. But everything was done in vain, because it 
was what the prophet says here: "waiting for someone 
and waiting for people". And Christ says [Matt. 15:9], "In 
vain do they serve me with the commandments of men." 
The dew from heaven and heavenly rain are necessary, 
that is, good and godly church ministers who teach the 
word of Christ purely. 

Therefore, the present passage contains a glorious 
praise of the ministry of preaching. But we must 
remember that the Holy Spirit speaks in this way of the 
Word and of the ministers of the Word. He alone adorns 
them with these exceedingly beautiful names, calling 
them "dew from the Lord" and "rain. But the world judges 
differently. For look at the pope and the whole church of 
the Antichrist. These ver- 


1100 L. XXVI, 382-384. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 5, 6.7. W. VI, 2N8-292I. 


1101 





equates the godly teachers with the poison that has been 
slithered into the world from hell. It condemns and curses 
the [right] teaching as the most harmful plague. Hence 
come the curses, the persecutions and the so many 
tortures of the godly. Therefore it is necessary that we 
strengthen ourselves against these judgments of the 
world, and wish ourselves happiness in this praise of the 
Holy Spirit, who compares the godly ministers of the 
gospel with the dew from heaven and the fertilizing rain. 
For we should esteem this one judgment higher than the 
whole world. 


V. 7 Yes, the remnant of Jacob will be among the 
nations of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts 
of the forest, like a young lion among a flock of sheep, 
whom no one can resist when he goes through, 
treading and tearing. 


This is another simile, which also serves as a prize 

for the ministry of preaching. Of course, this ministry is 
entirely designed to heal, as Christ says (Matth. 20, 28.j: 
"The Son of Man came to serve, and to give his life for 
the salvation of many. Therefore, the ministers of the 
Gospel are rightly compared to a gentle and fruitful rain. 
What, you will say, does it occur to the prophet that he 
compares the rest of Jacob to a lion raging in the forest 
among the wild beasts, and to a young lion who, 
because of his youth, is cruel and strikes down the 
defenseless sheep with hideous ferocity? Is this not 
contrary to each other? 
That is certainly true. But there are also completely 
opposite people with whom the word has to do. For those 
who accept the word in faith, it is in truth a heavenly dew 
and rain, as Christ says [Matth. 11, 28]: "Come unto me, 
all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and | will give you 
rest. But those who oppose the word, who not only do 
not accept it in faith, but want it persecuted and 
destroyed, as the ungodly synagogue did, as the Roman 
Empire did, to them the word and the whole ministry 
becomes a lion that tears and scatters. 





Therefore this parable has the same meaning that 
Christ expresses in Matth. 16, 18: "On this rock | will 
build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail 
against it. Examples of this are before our eyes. The 
synagogue has set itself against the apostles with all its 
might, but the apostles have been preserved. The 
synagogue has been destroyed from the ground up. 

But, you will say, the Romans destroyed them, they 
were the lion that tore and trampled, not the apostles. 
But listen to Christ, who says in Luc. 19:44, "Not one 
stone shall be left upon another, because thou knewest 
not the time wherein thou wast visited." Has not the 
synagogue been destroyed from the bottom up by this 
very ministry of the gospel, through which the faithful 
have been saved? In the same way it has happened to 
all enemies of the gospel from the beginning, since the 
gospel was preached. 

Therefore, this parable serves to comfort the church 
in the world, which is like a ship on the wide sea, tossed 
about by a terrifying storm. For Satan is not idle; he 
knows what fruits this very fruitful rain will bring forth. 
Therefore he endeavors to choke either the rain, which 
he cannot prevent, or the seed. He equips people with 
power, wealth, wisdom, dignity, and urges them to use 
these gifts to suppress the word. On the other hand, the 
church is almost without these gifts, for it lies like poor 
Lazarus in front of the rich man's house in the highest 
contempt, hatred, misery, in the highest dangers and 
hardships. When the godly consider this according to 
their, that is, according to human opinion, they judge that 
the church will perish. For how can she, the One, be a 
match for so many enemies, the world and the devils? 

But the prophet comforts us: it will happen that the 
church will be victorious, like a lion among the rest of the 
wild animals, and like a young lion among the sheep. But 
this victory will not be achieved in a human way, for he 
who is superior in strength will be victorious and defeat 
his adversary; but the Church, when defeated, will not 
be victorious by weapons or human strength, but in the 


1102 L. XXVI, 384-387. interpretations on the prophets’. W. VI, 2921-2925. 


1103 





Glory to the name of their God, that is, in the Word that 
is almighty and abides forever, as the prophet concludes 
here. 


V. 8 For thy hand shall prevail against all thine 
enemies, and all thine enemies shall be cut off. 


You clearly see that the church, which is triumphant, 
is in such a condition in the world that it is plagued, that 
it has many enemies. Why do we fools anxiously strive 
that the church has no enemies and that harmony is 
established everywhere? But it would be bearable if the 
church had only enemies, and the enemies were not also 
its fearful ones, who plague the church in many ways. 
Therefore it must suffer tribulation and fear, but at the 
same time victory must be hoped for, not only the fall of 
the enemies of the Word, but their extermination. 

Reason thinks that perdition threatens those who 
have to fight with a more powerful enemy. But the Holy 
Spirit says that this is the only and certain way to 
inevitable destruction if you are among the enemies of 
the Church. Why then do we allow ourselves to be 
moved by this when we see kings and princes making 
alliances to corrupt the Church? Why do we wish evil 
upon them? 

For should one not have pity on those who pierce 
themselves with their own sword? For they cannot harm 
the church and have here their judgment, which is firmly 
decided: it will happen that they will be exterminated. 
The greater the reverence for the word and the greater 
the zeal for it should be among kings and princes, who, 
after all, are united in their efforts to ensure that the 
gospel cannot be preached freely anywhere. Therefore, 
Germany is facing a certain devastation. O Lord, grant 
peace in our time. Amen. 


V. 9, 10: In that day, saith the LORD, will | put away 
thy horses from thee, and destroy thy chariots; and | 
will cut off the cities of thy land, and break down all thy 
strongholds. 


Above the prophet has set a general prophecy, it will 
happen that all the 


Enemies of the church and the word will be 
exterminated. Now he adds a special prophecy about 
the Jews and the synagogue, that it will be completely 
destroyed because it opposes the gospel. Therefore, 
although the Romans had their worldly causes for 
besieging and conquering Jerusalem, yet the real and 
certain cause of their calamity was that the synagogue 
opposed the apostles and the gospel, as Christ also 
says [Luc. 19:44], "Not one stone shall be left upon 
another, because thou knewest not the time wherein 
thou wast visited," that is, because thou believedst not 
the gospel. Through the Romans, therefore, the horses 
were destroyed and the chariots broken, that is, the 
kingdom and all the power of this people was broken. 

As this began with the Jewish people, so it has 
happened with the Gentiles until this day. For wherever 
the word was preached and not received, sure 
destruction followed. The Roman Empire serves as an 
example; after that, almost all of Asia; furthermore, the 
misfortune of Greece, Thrace and other neighboring 
peoples, over whom the inhuman Turks now rule, is 
before our eyes. 

Therefore, this admonition is necessary wherever the 
gospel is preached, that all should accept and grasp it 
with reverence. But we see that God did not want the 
gospel to be preached by angels; it is men to whom He 
entrusts this task. But just as they are strictly forbidden 
to abuse their office in order to gain power and wealth, 
so the church is commanded to hold these ministers of 
the word in honor, to feed them generously, and to show 
them reverence. And it is for this reason that the 
Scriptures praise the ministry of the Word so gloriously. 
Isaiah says Cap. 52, 7: "How lovely are the feet of the 
messengers who proclaim peace," and our Micah 
compares them in a very beautiful image to the dew from 
heaven and a fruitful rain; elsewhere they are called 
angels. The Holy Spirit makes use of such praise with 
the certain intention that he also inspires us to reverence 
the ministers of the Word. 

And there are also examples available, as 


1104 L. XXVI, 387-389. interpretation of Micah (1.), Cap. 5, 9-13. 


W. VI, 2925-2928. 1105 





God has inflicted the most severe punishments on the 
despisers of the servants of the Word. | will be silent 
about the flood of sin, about the fall of Sodom, about the 
earth swallowing Korah and his comrades. When Elisha 
was mocked by the boys, the bears came and tore forty- 
two of the children [2 Kings 2:24]. And these reproached 
the old man only for his bald head, and the youthful age 
would have deserved an excuse, - but how much more 
severely will God punish the contempt of the preaching 
office on the adults, who believe that they can cover their 
shameful deeds with it, if they bring the preaching office 
into contempt by trumped-up accusations. The Jews 
tormented the apostles in many ways; they poked them 
with rods, they threatened them, they threw them into 
bands, they killed them. Through this tyranny, as the 
prophet says, they lost their horses and chariots, and 
their strongholds and cities were destroyed. 


V. 11. And | will cut off thy sorcerers from among 
thee, that no diviners of signs shall abide with thee. > 


As he threatened the kingdom or the worldly regiment 
with destruction, so he threatens here also the 
priesthood, which he compares for a certain reason with 


the prophesying from birdcalls (auguriis) and sign 
interpretations, as we will say later. Furthermore, the 
Hebrews have many names for the pagan divinations 


(divinorum), which Moses has listed almost all in the 5th 
book Cap. 18. In this place is XXXXX, which is almost 
everywhere rendered by the word "sorcerer", for it 
denotes those who use witchcraft or sorcery. The other 
word is XXXXXXX, by which sign interpreters are 
understood, who either prophesy from birdcalls or follow 
astronomical observations. 

But what resemblance have these to the priesthood? 
For also in the other prophets it is common to compare 
the godless teachers with the sorcerers. Such passages 
almost all look at the sermon of Samuel, which he 
preached to Saul 1 Sam. 15, 23. where he says: "For 
disobedience is a sorcerer's sin, and reluctance is 
idolatry and idolatry.” 





Sorcery is an obvious renunciation of God, because 
the trust in God's help, which should only be expected 
from God, is transferred to the creatures and to God's 
adversary, Satan. The prophet compares the Jewish 
priesthood with this sin. Because it was commanded 
from heaven [Luc. 9, 35]: "You shall hear him", but the 
priests do not want to hear and persecute the gospel, 
God judges that all their sacrifices, all services, prayers 
and practices are, as it were, an abominable sorcery and 
a renunciation of God. For, as Samuel says [1 Sam. 15, 
22], obedience is better than sacrifice, and attention 
better than offering the fat of rams. 

In this way, our adversaries utterly hate the gospel, 
condemn it as a heresy, and strive to destroy it. 
Meanwhile, they insist on vows, masses, fasts, 
pilgrimages, and other trivial things. But we rightly 
compare this to sorcery, that God abhors all these things, 
as He abhors sorcery, in which is a manifest impiety and 
a renunciation of God. For they throw away the highest 
service of God, namely obedience to the Word, and 
meanwhile think that they are holy through their human 
statutes. 

Therefore, both the secular government and the 
priesthood of the Jews were disturbed and destroyed, 
because the Jews stubbornly kept the law and despised 
the gospel and persecuted it with hostile hatred. 


| will cut off from you your images and your idols, 
and you will no longer worship the work of your hands. 
And | will break down thy groves, and destroy thy 
cities. 

A similar passage is above in the first chapter [v. 6, 
7. But | said there that these threats serve to make the 
people realize that this idolatry is not only futile, but also 
highly offensive to God. For what is the point of 
threatening the stones and the wood? Therefore, since 
he says that these shall perish, he instructs the people 
so that they will not place any hope in the service of 
them, but will come out of the

The people were to take away the punishment and learn 
that God had been severely offended by this idolatry. 
But it has been discussed above [Cap. 1, 7.], which 
images can be tolerated and which have to be removed. 
For the prophet also expressly indicates the same here, 
saying, "Thou shalt not worship the works of thy hands." 
Therefore, worship and service are condemned, but 
images are not rejected outright, 1) if they are only 
proper and not annoying images; for even the 
annoyance must be taken into account. This is what 
Hezekiah did when he destroyed the bronze serpent 
after it had been burned with incense, 2 Kings 18:4. 
But the text indicates not indistinctly that the godly 
king did this against the will of the people and the 
priests, because therefore it is added: "The king trusted 
in the Lord, the God of Israel, and called the serpent 
Nehusthan," that is, ore. For he knew, though it was 
made by the command of God, that it was not made for 
worship, but that those who were injured by the serpents 
might be healed. Outside of this use, he says, the ore is 
only ore. Therefore it was an impiety that divine honors 
were paid to it, and it is broken and crushed by Hezekiah 
out of very good intention. In this way, a godly authority 
should cut off everywhere what is annoying, so that

The remains of the papacy should not once cause new 
damage to the descendants. 


V. 14. And | will take vengeance with fury and wrath 
on all the nations that will not obey. 


This is a glorious sentence, which includes the last 
judgment. For just as it was to the Jews' destruction that 
they had set themselves against the gospel, so the same 
will happen to the rest of the nations, until at last on the 
last day general vengeance will be executed against all 
who have not obeyed the gospel. 

But it is especially to be noted that he remembers no 
sin, but that they would not have obeyed. But this is 
because it was commanded from heaven, "Him you shall 
hear." Those who do not obey this commandment are 
preparing their own destruction. 

This is the glorious prophecy of the kingdom of 
Christ, in which he describes the king himself in the first 
place, that he is God. Likewise, his ministry, that he will 
pasture in the glory of the name of his God. Thirdly, he 
also indicates the power and dignity of the evangelical 
preaching ministry. And finally, he prophesies that all, 
whether Jews or Gentiles, who do not obey this teaching 
will be lost. We are to be mindful of this threat and accept 
the word with all reverence. Now follows another 
sermon. 


The sixth chapter. 


This chapter contains a wonderful sermon of 
repentance. For in the beginning he remembers the 
many and great benefits that God has shown this 
people. But because they did not give due thanks to their 
Creator, he punishes them and condemns. their 
ingratitude. 

Since the people could not deny this sin, they turn to 
their usual pretense and seek protection against God's 
wrath in sacrifices and other legal things. 





But God indicates another way in which He can and will 
be reconciled. Therefore, this passage shows a glorious 
doctrine and an excellent contrast between the right and 
wrong services. The last part is a threat. For because 
they do not obey God, who teaches them the right 
worship, but continue in their sins, he threatens them 
with destruction. For this is the end of disobedience or 
sin.

V. 1. Listen to what the Lord says. 


This is acommon preface of the prophets, which they 
use not only to gain prestige and faith, but even more to 
warn the people, so that they do not fall into a terrible 
sin, namely into contempt of God and His word. For this 
is what people usually do, especially when they hear of 
the wrath of God, so that they believe that they will be 
dealt with less harshly. Therefore, even when they are 
in the midst of sins, they invent the hope of forgiveness, 
and either laugh at the threats of the prophets or do not 
care about them, as if they were little human feet. The 
prophet wants to heal this evil by saying that one should 
hear the Lord, not him; the Lord speaks, not him. 


Arise and rebuke the mountains and let the hills 
hear your voice. 


Here we want to pass over the inconsistent things, 
which Jerome brings forward, who understands the 
angels by the mountains and hills. For, he says, because 
they are ministering spirits, they are justly accused (for 
in Revelation (Cap. 2) the angels of the churches are 
accused), if they have not done the will of the Lord. On 
the other hand, if they have done it, the guilt is on the 
people. Afterwards, as is his way, he seeks another 
equally inconsistent opinion and says: or the mountains 
and foundations of the earth are Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. 
This is far from the opinion of the prophet. 

But he deserved pardon, if this picture was only in 
this one place. But since everywhere in the prophets the 
name mountains and hills is used to designate the 
princes and those who, by their position in office, stand 
out above the rest of the crowd, why was it necessary to 
invent such inconsistent things? Especially since the 
prophet himself says what he wants without a picture, 
since he adds [v. 2]: "The Lord wants to rebuke his 
people and wants to punish Israel. For here the people 
are rightly compared to the mountains because of the 
glorious gifts by which they excelled over all the nations 
of the earth, as the Psalm says 





[Ps. 147, 20: "He does not do this to a heathen. Then in 
this holy nation the hills and mountains are the kings and 
princes, for these stand out above the rest of the people, 
just as in the church the hills and mountains are the 
priests and prophets. 

But that the Lord commands that he should rebuke the 
holy people and punish the princes in both kingdoms 
because of the bad administration of their office is 
dangerous in two ways. For those who have the highest 
authority suffer least of all to be punished and can do the 
most harm. Therefore, this sermon not only brought 
hatred to the prophet, but also exposed him to certain 
dangers. For he undoubtedly had to hear what we hear 
today when we punish the vices of princes: in this way 
the prestige of the authorities would be diminished, the 
hearts of the subjects would be alienated from the 
authorities, and through such sermons, as it were, the 
seed of rebellion would be scattered among the common 
people. One must punish the vices in general, but not 
attack the authorities with explicit words. For this not only 
does no good, but can also do harm. Some add that in 
this way the preachers try to pave the way so that they 
get the reins of the secular regime in their hands. But the 
tyrants do not protect themselves in this way with 
reasons, but proceed by force against the prophets, as 
the examples of Micah (1 Kings 22:26 ff.), Jeremiah and 
others testify. 

But the prophet is not moved by any of these things; he 
does not spare the dignity of the mountains, he is not 
moved by its danger. He looks at the commandment of 
the Lord and holds that these must be obeyed, even if a 
thousand rebellions should arise from it. 

But in vain do they accuse us of sedition, which is always 
the punishment for the sin of not administering the 
preaching office properly. Therefore, those who want to 
forestall or prevent sedition must not be anxious that 
those who are commanded the teaching office should 
cover up the sins of the persons in authority. For in this 
way the Lord is provoked to take vengeance. Therefore, 
they should allow the sins to be covered. 


1110 L. XXVI, 394-396. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 2936-2939. 


1111 





be punished freely, for this is the command of God; but 
they shall desist. For since the sword has been given to 
the authorities by God so that they may keep wrongdoers 
in check, their office is hindered if they themselves lie in 
the sins that they should punish their subjects for. For 
how should he dare to punish adultery who himself has 
many witnesses of his adultery everywhere? But the Holy 
Scriptures sufficiently testify that if the authorities are not 
forgiving or severe enough in punishing the wrongdoers, 
God is provoked to inflict common punishments, whereas 
the sword of Phinehas, which is drawn against the 
fornicator, pacifies the wrath of God and brings the 
common plague to an end. 25, 7. f.], as also the 106th 
Psalm, v. 30, testifies: "Then came to Phinehas, and 
settled the matter; and the plague was controlled." This 
is first of all a great reason why the authorities must be 
reminded of their office and punished when they sin 
somewhere. 

After this, it must also be noted that the subjects, 
challenged as it were by the example of the authorities, 
think that they can sin safely. For they think that they can 
imitate without danger what they see in the authorities. 
Therefore the prophet does right that he does not cover 
up the vices of the rulers, but punishes them freely, as 
his preaching office demands. And his example should 
be followed by all who want to teach the churches rightly. 


V. 2. Hear, O mountains, how the LORD will punish 
with the strong foundations of the earth; for the LORD 
will rebuke his people, and will punish Israel. 


He calls "foundations of the earth" the same, what he 
called "mountains" before, as the 47th Psalm, v. 10, calls 
them in the same way "shields on earth". For if there were 
no authorities and laws, the peace that is necessary to 
feed, raise and teach children, both in religion and in 
domestic affairs, could not exist in the face of such great 
depravity of men. 

But there is a special emphasis on the words “his 
people" and "Israel". It is as if he wants to say: | am 
obliged to 





to punish and condemn according to the command of 
God, who are God's people, who are presumptuous 
because of their righteousness and boast that they are 
holy and God's dear children. Now follows the scolding, 
which at first sight seems to be very mild. But the less the 
people can approve of their ingratitude, the more violently 
they are accused and forced to condemn themselves. 


V.3-5. What have | done to you, my people, and how 
have | offended you? Tell me. For | brought thee out of 
Egypt, and redeemed thee from the house of bondage, 
and sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 
Remember, my people, the charge of Balak king of 
Moab, and the answer of Balaam the son of Beor, from 
Shittim even unto Gilgal; that ye may know how the 
LORD hath done you all good. 


The sum is: the Lord has showered you with benefits 
of every kind, so much the greater is your sin that you live 
as if he were hostile to you and your highest adversary, 
and as if he had undertaken all hostilities against you. 

But he remembers three good deeds. First, that he 
freed them from the image of the tyrant and adopted them 
as his people, as it is also said in the first commandment: 
"lam your God, who brought you out of Egypt. 

Secondly, that he gave them Moses as leader and 
regent, Aaron as priest and Miriam as prophetess. But we 
see in this passage that God names as the highest 
benefit a godly authority, both in the worldly regiment and 
in the Church. Therefore, both Moses and Aaron are held 
in higher esteem before God than the unbelieving Jews, 
who more than once sought to stone them. 

The third benefit is: Since Balak had persuaded the 
prophet Balaam to curse the people, the Lord forced him 
to bless them. For this is what the prophet praises 
primarily in this passage. But the fact that he remembers 
the whole journey from Sittim to Gilgal also includes the 
miracle that happened to the people who went dry-footed 
through the Jordan. All this, he says, is intended so that 
you may learn that God is a 


1112 L. XXVI, 396-398. interpretation of Micah (1.), Cap. 6, 3-7. 


W. VI, 2939-2942. 111Z 





benefactor. For here the word is written which is like in 
the sermon of Daniel [Cap. 
9, 16.] does not indicate justice, but rather kindness. 

Since this refers to the Jews, Jerome draws a spiritual 
interpretation, so that this sermon of the prophet would 
not be read by us without all fruit. But we have another 
likeness, and that of greater good deeds, which should 
provoke us to repentance. For we have had our Pharaoh 
and our Egypt, namely the tyranny of Satan and death, 
because of sin. But we are delivered from this captivity 
by the blood of the Son of God. This tremendous 
blessing is also a far more glorious salvation than that 
from Egypt. Nor do we lack our Moses, Aaron and 
Miriam, for we have good and godly teachers of the 
Word through the goodness of God. Paul also glorifies 
this blessing when he says [Eph. 4:11] that it is a gift of 
the ascension of Christ that there are several prophets, 
several apostles, several evangelists, several teachers 
and shepherds in the church. 

But when Balak urges Balaam the prophet to curse 
the people, does this not fit in very well with the fact that 
the godless princes unite with the popes so that they 
curse the true church and do evil? But the Lord turns 
their curses into blessings. For everything they have 
done so far against the pure doctrine, God has turned it 
all around so that the glory of the Word would be the 
greater, and the deceitfulness and ungodliness of our 
adversary would be the more evident. 

Therefore, it would behoove us not to be ungrateful 
in the face of such a great amount of God's benefits, but 
to show our obedience and gratitude by living a holy life. 
It is proper for us to flee and abhor offenses. But 
because we do not do this, we have to expect an even 
more severe judgment than the Jews. 


V. 6.7 With what shall | propitiate the Lord? With 
bowing down before the high God? Shall | propitiate 
him with burnt ue and calves of the year? Do 
you a the Lord is pleased with many thousands of 
rams? 


Would countless streams be full? Or shall | give my 
first son for my transgression? or the fruit of my body 
for the sin of my soul? 

The people recognize their sin, just as we must also 
recognize our sin when we compare the divine benefits 
with our lives and customs. Here, therefore, is a very 
beautiful illustration of what people tend to do in such 
consternation. They become fainthearted through fear of 
evil and take refuge in hypocritical works; through these, 
they hope, they can reconcile God. But the prophet here 
publicly indicates that God does not want sacrifices, as 
does Isaiah Cap. 1, 13. And Hosea says [Cap. 6, 6.], "I 
delight in love, and not in sacrifice." Likewise says the 
fiftieth Psalm, v. 13. Therefore it indicates another way 
to propitiate GOD. 

Here, therefore, arises a question that is worth to be 
dealt with. Why does God reject the sacrifices that He 
commanded the Jews to perform as a service of God? 
Therefore, the Jews could be blamed if they had not 
sacrificed, but that they sacrificed must not be blamed. 

To this question | answer thus: It is true that God 
commanded the sacrifices as a service. But He did not 
command them alone, for He also gave commandments 
of other, inward and, as Paul calls it [Rom. 12:1], 
"reasonable" services. Then God did not command the 
sacrifices for the purpose that they should be a 
satisfaction for sins. 

Therefore, these sacrifices of the Jews or the legal 
services had a twofold affliction. The first affliction was 
that they performed these or unreasonable services with 
the omission of the other, reasonable services, which 
are, as the prophet mentions later, "keeping God's word, 
practicing love and being humble before God. So also 
Hosea says [Cap. 6, 6.]: "God delights in love and not in 
sacrifice, and in the knowledge of God and not in burnt 
offerings.". And the 50th Psalm, v. 14. f.: "Offer 
thanksgiving to GOD and pay your vows to the Most 
High. And call upon me in trouble, and | will deliver thee, 
and thou shalt praise me." 


1114 L. XXVI, 399-401. interpretations on the prophets.- W. VI, 2942-2945. 


1115 





The wicked do not perform this service. For when all 
is well, they are secure, do not recognize God as the 
giver [of good], do not use God's gifts according to God's 
will, and in adversity do not take refuge in God, but seek 
human help. Since they leave that which is most noble 
and highest in the queue, how can God take pleasure in 


the lesser and, as it were, unreasonable (brutali) 
worship? 

Thus Isaiah preaches [Cap. 1:11], "What is the 
multitude of your sacrifices to me? | am full of the burnt 
offerings of rams, and of the fat of the fatlings, and have 
no desire for the blood of bullocks." [Wash, cleanse 
yourselves, put away your evil from my sight, forsake 
evil; learn to do good, seek justice, help the oppressed. 
These are truly good works, and cannot be feigned by 
the wicked. Therefore the wicked refrain from them, let 
their avarice, their lust for pleasure, their anger 2c. run 
wild, as the 50th Psalm, v. 18, says: "When you see a 
thief, you run with him" 2c. Accordingly, the ungodly seek 
to cover and conceal this ungodliness by this hypocrisy 
of outward worship. Therefore, God rightly condemns 
and rejects these services. 

In the household, a master requires his servant to 
sweep the house with a broom. But he has not hired the 
servant for this work alone, for he has required the 
servant to do other, greater work, that he be faithful with 
the property, that he be steady and diligent in the work 
2c. Therefore, if the servant neglects those greater 
things, would he not earn little thanks by the diligence he 
puts into sweeping? especially if the Lord recognizes 
that the servant is thus seeking a cover for his 
wickedness and laziness. Thus, God condemns the 
sacrifices of the Jews, because they completely 
neglected the greater and reasonable services and 
covered their impiety with this show of sacrifices. 

The second defect was that the Jews not only 
covered the ungodliness of the hearts with the sacrifices, 
but also wanted them to be a ransom for the sins of the 
people. 





were to be. But GOD had not instituted nor commanded 
the sacrifices for this purpose; He wanted the priests to 
be taken care of in this way, and the sacrifices were a 
model of the supreme sacrifice, that through the death 
of the Son of GOD the sins of the world should be atoned 
for. But this sacrifice of the Son of God the wicked did 
not consider and attributed to their sacrifices the 
forgiveness of sins. Is it not utter impiety and blasphemy 
to attribute to the blood of goats and oxen the honor that 
belongs only to the blood of Christ? 

Therefore, throughout the prophets, God says that He 
has an abomination in the sacrifices, that He has not 
commanded them 2c. For He had indeed commanded 
them, but not for that purpose. He would also accept 
them as testimonies of obedience to GOD, if they were 
not disobedient in greater and more important things. 
But since they refrain from the greater services and 
perform these lesser and truly unreasonable services 
with such ungodly delusion, God has an abomination in 
the sacrifices and also ridicules them, as it is said in the 
50th Psalm, v. 13: "Do you mean that | will eat ox meat, 
or drink goat's blood?" 

And also the Jews saw that these were not the highest 
divine services, if they sacrificed a heifer or a ram. 
Therefore they turned to more precious sacrifices, as the 
prophet testifies here: "Even if you sacrifice a thousand 
rams and whole streams of oil, this will be an unpleasant 
service to the Lord, for, as it says in the 50th Psalm, v. 
10 f.: "All the beasts of the forest are the Lord's, and all 
the beasts of the field are his." 

Therefore they took another advice and sacrificed their 
sons and daughters in honor and service to God. They 
took the occasion for this cruelty from what Abraham had 
done. Because God praised his obedience so much that 
he wanted to sacrifice his son, they thought that God 
would also be reconciled through service if they 
sacrificed their children to him. And looking at the work 
itself, it was a great and heavy one. For who would not 
rather put his goods, even his life, in danger, than have 
his children sacrificed to others for slaughter? 


1116 L. XXVI, 401-403. interpretation of Micah (1.), Cap. 6, 6-8. 


W. VI, 2948-2949. 1117 





or slaughter them themselves? Therefore, the pagans 
also imitated this service. But the wretched hypocrites 
did not see that Abraham was commanded to kill and 
sacrifice his son, but that they were not commanded to 
do so. Therefore, not only was it not a worship service, 
but it was also a very grave sin against the fifth 
commandment, in which killing is forbidden. 

Thus the monks praise their services, praise their 
good works, that they abstain from civil business, pray 
at certain hours, abstain from certain foods 2c. But 
because they do all this without God's command, their 
services are no more pleasing to God than those wicked 
sacrifices in which parents offered their children to God. 
For there can be no worship where there is not an 
express command of God, according to the words of 
Christ [Matt. 15:9], "In vain do they serve me with the 
commandments of men." 

Therefore, this passage teaches that hypocrites seek 
to propitiate God with their works, which are such that 
they are not good in themselves. This, however, is not 
the right way to propitiate GOD. Therefore, the prophet 
now teaches how God wants to be reconciled. 


V. 8. You are told, man, what is good and what the 
Lord requires of you, namely, to keep God's word (ut 
facias judicium), and to practice love, and to be 
humble before your God. 


First, there is a glorious prize in that he says he will 
teach what is good and what God requires. Therefore, 
we can be sure that if we do this, we will please God. 
For God promotes only what is good, and what He 
demands is pleasing to Him, whereas other services 
that we ourselves have chosen cannot please God, 
such as monastic vows, the impure celibate state, the 
sacrifice of the living and the dead, the service of saints, 
pilgrimages, prayers at certain hours, abstaining from 
certain foods 2c. 

These things have a great appearance and are quite 
troublesome to me. Therefore the world judges them to 
be good and pleasing to God. But they all lack the 
glorious prize with which the prophet exalts his teaching, 
saying that he will teach what is good and what is not. 


what the Lord demands. For all these things are 
instituted by human will, not by divine prestige; therefore 
they have reward from men, not from God, as Christ 
says: "In vain do they serve me with the commandments 
of men" 2c. 

Right and good services are therefore those which 


God demands, namely facere judicium. This is 
generally interpreted as: to administer justice (justa 


agere), that is, to punish the guilty and to protect the 
innocent. For here the prophet deals with the 
"mountains," that is, with the kings and princes to whom 
God has commanded the sword. When they use the 
sword to keep the wicked in check, they are certain that 
they are doing a good work, which God demands, 
whereas those who perform their office casually, and 
either sin out of negligence or allow themselves to be 
moved by their danger not to proceed with serious 
punishment against the wrongdoers, are doing an evil 
work and leaving in place what God demands. 


In this sense, this expression [facere judicium] is 
generally taken in Scripture. For | do not approve of 


Jerome's opinion, for he interprets judicium facere in 
such a way that we are not to do anything without 
deliberation and counsel, so that the soul first judges 
what it wants to do and arranges it accordingly in the 


work. This is the philosophical judicium, but Scripture, 


as | have said, calls something quite different judicium. 
This sense is therefore not inappropriate, that it 
exhorts the authorities to execute their office, as also 
Isaiah in this sense commands Cap. 1, 17. that they 
should seek justice, and adds as it were as an 
interpretation: "Help the oppressed" 2c. 
But because the prophet has in this place a general 
preaching of repentance, the word judicium is to be 
taken a little further. For it is known that it is often taken 
for the word of God, as the 119th Psalm, v. 13, 30, 39, 
62, 2c., proves, and that because the word judges men 
by condemning evil and teaches what is holy and the 
truth. Therefore, in this place judicium facere is to pay 
attention to the word, to follow and obey it, not to oppose 
the word, not to hate the word. 


1118 L. XXVI, 403-406. interpretations on the prophets. 'W. VI, 2949-2952. 


1119 








but accept it with thanksgiving, obey it, do nothing 
without the word, do diligently what the word commands 
2c. 

This commandment does not only include the 
outward practices in life or the good works, but also the 
spiritual movements, of which the first tablet teaches. 
For these are the two most noble parts of the Word of 
God, that it teaches to trust in God and to fear God. 
Trusting in God requires the knowledge of Christ. 
Therefore, we must first make every effort to pay 
attention to the word of God, to trust in the mercy shown 
for the sake of Christ, and to fear Him. But this service 
is of such a kind that it can be performed by all. For if 
sacrifices were required, the rich would be best off, but 
the poor would not do well. But God does not demand 
that great costs be put into it, but He demands a heart 
that fears His word [Is. 66, 2] and trusts in His mercy. 

The second is to love mercy or charity. And he 

explicitly uses the word "love" in Latin, because he sees 
that in the hearts of all men there is a peculiar desire to 
do good to themselves and to neglect others. He wants 
this attitude to be removed from our hearts and wants us 
to have a special desire for charity toward all people. 
Here, too, is such a service that can be performed by all. 
For what position is so low that one could not benefit 
others in it? The position of servants and maids is 
considered the lowest, but if they diligently do what they 
are commanded to do, if they take care of the household 
or the children, they do a more holy work than all monks 
and nuns, for they do what God commands. Those, 
however, toil with hardships that they have taken upon 
themselves according to their own will without God's 
command, even against God's command. 
The third is to walk humbly before God. This does not 
only mean that we should not be arrogant, hopeful and 
presumptuous, but also that we should be humble 
before God. 





Be patient on the cross, as Peter says [1 Ep. 5, 6]: 
"Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God", that 
is, suffer God's will with equanimity. Do not become 
indignant, do not turn away from God to human and illicit 
help, but humble yourselves, that is, recognize the 
punishment of sins or at least the necessary death of the 
old man; then pray and hope for salvation through 
Christ. 

These are the right services and the right repentance. 
Those who perform these will be loved, protected and 
defended by God. And the true church makes it its 
business to render this service to God and to encourage 
people to such a way of life and morals. But the church 
of the Antichrist does the opposite. For it persecutes and 
blasphemes the Word, then it is cruel to the true church. 
But it abhors the cross, seeks prosperity and idleness. 
Therefore, the same punishments will befall them that 
the prophet now threatens the wicked. 


V. 9 The voice of the LORD shall call upon the city: 
but he that feareth thy name shall prosper. 


This is related to the preceding. So far, the prophet 
has punished the hypocritical services as useless to 
propitiate God, and has taught the right services and the 
right way to propitiate God and mitigate the 
punishments. Seeing that this sweet and wholesome 
voice of God is despised, he threatens that God will 
speak with another voice, which they must not only hear 
but also experience. For as the whole of Scripture shows 
that God wants to forgive the repentant, so it threatens 
the unrepentant with destruction. 

Furthermore, this angry voice of God does not 
concern only one city, but all. Therefore the word is to 
be taken collectively, just like where Paul says in the 
letter to Titus Cap. 1, 5: You shall appoint the elders 
XXXXXXXX, which we have translated "the cities back and 
forth". 

But he also adds a consolation here to raise up the 
godly, so that they do not lose heart in the common 
misfortune. He says: "The Lord will help every single one 
of us.

City speak. This will be a voice of anger and wrath. But 
it will only come upon those who are unrepentant and do 
not listen to the word. But the others who fear the name 
of the Lord will be saved. 

For although the Hebrew word is interpreted by the 
rabbis in various ways, it is sufficiently known that it 
means salvation, success, happiness and the like, as 
also the passage Proverbs 8:14 shows: XXXXXX 
XXXXXX, mine is both counsel and success. For that we 
take right counsel, that is God's gift. But because also 
right counsels sometimes turn out badly, so XXXX,, 
success, is required. Likewise Proverbs 2, 1) 7: He will 
preserve the pious, that is, he will give them success, he 
will preserve them in peril, while the wicked will perish 
2c. 

But the prophet includes a beautiful contrast. For he 
sees everyone as striving to increase their wealth, 
because they think that money and property provide 
protection against common misfortune. Therefore he 
says: You are mistaken if you have such an opinion, for 
unjust goods are a cause of destruction. But those will 
be saved who fear the name of the Lord, that is, who 
accept the word, who obey the word. But he uses this 
way of speaking for this reason, that he expressly says: 
"Those who fear your name", because the hypocrites will 
never suffer that this is said of them, that they do not fear 
the Lord. For that is why they sacrifice, that is why they 
are so persistent in performing outward acts of worship. 
But looking to the word, they reveal themselves that, as 
the Psalm says [Ps. 36:2], there is no fear of God with 
them. For either they pursue the word, or neglect it. They 
indulge their lusts when there is opportunity; they are 
stingy, ambitious, cruel 2c. 

Furthermore, we are to pray that this sermon also 
concerns us. There is no one who is not horrified by the 
Turk's cruelty,

1121 


which is approaching us more and more every day. This 
is the voice of the Lord calling over disobedient Germany, 
but those who fear the name of the Lord shall be saved. 
For these the LORD knows how to preserve and bring 
out, like Daniel in Babylon, in the midst of Turkey. A 
similar saying is Proverbs 16:6: "By goodness and 
faithfulness iniquity is reconciled; and by the fear of the 
LORD evil is avoided." 


Hear, you tribes, what is preached (Audite, tribus, 
sed quis testificabitur ei? ). 


There is some difficulty here in the grammar. For 
some take the word for rod, so that the sense would be: 
Hear the rod or the scourge and the one who bears 
witness to it. Jerome, however, translates: Hear, ye 
tribes, and who shall approve it? But in the interpretations 
he follows another opinion, for he says thus: Hear, ye 
tribes, what the LORD testifieth unto you. For the word 
XXX, according to the usual way of speaking, means to 
preach, to make known, to teach. 

But if we look at the text, the opinion is very simple. 
First, the prophet commands the tribes to listen; then, 
despairing, as it were, of the fruit, he says, "Who can 
testify to him? that is, "Who can teach this people? Who 
can preach to them? since no fruit follows, but they 
continue in their sins without all repentance, as follows in 
the text: 


V. 10. still remains a a ood in the house 
of the wicked, and the hostile low ephah (Nonne adhuc 
ignis in domo impii thesauri impietatis, et modius 
macilentus ira plenus?). 

In the first part of this saying the Hebrews have a 
twofold reading. For some read “'.n, is not then? while the 
text now says, which some interpret by man, others by 
fire. But it is more appropriate to the sense that it is 
interpreted by fire, although the grammarians require a 
different way of punctuation. But here "fire" means 
punishment, as above Amos 5:6: "Seek ye the LORD, 
and ye shall live: lest there be a fire in the house of 
Joseph, and it consume him, and there be none to 
quench it in Bethel." 


1122 xxvi, 408-4io. interpretations on the prophets. W. vi, 


And this is a very beautiful picture that depicts the 
goods acquired by fraud and injustice, namely that they 
are, as it were, a fire that must inevitably burn those who 
possess them themselves, as also the commonly known 
proverbs testify: Unjust goods do not come to the third 
heir. Evil gained, evil lost. And Solomon says [Proverbs 
3:33], "In the house of the wicked is the curse." 

But here behold the shameful, shall I say, 
godlessness or faithless obstinacy of men. 1) For 
everyone would shudder if he saw a burning torch being 
brought to his roof. For therein lies obvious danger, and 
often the greatest conflagrations arise from an unnoticed 
little spark. But why do we not in like manner be 
astonished at the goods obtained by avarice and 
injustice, which the prophet here says are a fire? For it 
is true what Chrysostom says somewhere, that small 
goods, which are acquired by fraud, consume as it were 
also the great goods, which are honestly and well 
acquired. Christ also compares what is rightly acquired 
to thorns that choke the seed [Luc. 8:14]. But that which 
has been badly acquired either melts away shamefully 
or harms the heirs, as experience shows. 

And yet they all make a point of getting rich, be it 
rightly or wrongly. But they despise these threats as old 
wives' tales. But this happens because the Lord 
dampens the fire for a time, so to speak, and does not 
let it immediately shine forth and consume. For the 
wicked flourish for a time like the cederu of Lebanon. But 
shortly after that happens what the Psalm says [Ps. 37, 
36.]: "When one passed by, behold, he was gone; | 
asked for him, and he was nowhere to be found." How 
is that? Because the fire consumed him, which he fed in 
his house, kindled and made so great that it could not be 
quenched. 

The same opinion has the piece which is added that 
the small measure is "anger". But this is also a very 
beautiful picture, that 


1) impietatemne an incredulam pertinaciam di- carn. In 
the Jena and Erlangen editions, there is a comma before us. 


2955-2953. 1123 


he calls it XXX XXXX, a measure of leanness which 
does not overflow, but in which something is lacking; as, 


on the other hand, Christ names xaAdu LETpOD, METI- 


EOUEDOD yal cEecadEnuévov yal dmEpEyyuvdueEvod, 
that is, "a full, pressed, shaken, and superfluous 
measure," Luc. 6, 38. 

But it also happens that people, as the prophet calls 
it, use a Meager measure and hope for profit. But what 
kind of profit is it? The prophet answers, it is XXXXX, 
that is, wrath, or the threat of a certain evil that will follow. 
But who is so foolish and senseless that he should 
desire such goods that are connected with the wrath of 
God? Certainly all those who do not use the right 
measure, but a small and too small measure when 
selling. 


V. 11. 12. Or shall | approve the unjust scales and 
false weight in the purse, by which their rich do much 
wrong- And their inhabitants deal in lies, and have 
false tongues in their mouths. 


Here he punishes the weight, as he punished the 
false measure above. For people believe that there is 
profit in falsifying the weight, but the Lord condemns this. 
Therefore, the more fraudulent sellers think they are 
taking from others, the more they are taking from 
themselves. For they provoke the wrath of God, as the 
Scriptures threaten elsewhere, Proverbs 11:1: "False 
scales are an abomination to the Lord, but a perfect 
weight is His good pleasure." 

What we have translated "wrong weight" is XXXXX 
XXXX wrong stones in Hebrew, because. 

The people used weights of stone, not, as we do, of brass 
and generally of iron. The same way of speaking is 
Proverbs 16, 11: "Right scales and weights are from the 


Lord, and all the pounds (lapides == stones) in the sack 
are his works." In our [Latin] editions it says seculi 


[instead of sacculi] ina corrupt way. 

Although what he adds of the lie and the false tongue 
seems to be related to the doctrine, it is more correctly 
understood of the infidelity and unreliability of the caliphs 
and craftsmen known to the whole world, with which they 
all deceive.

1125 





V.13. Therefore | will also begin to afflict you and 


make you desolate because of your sin. 

The word XXXXXX derives Jerome from XXX, which 
means to begin. But others claim that it comes from XXX 
and interpret it: | have made you sick, as it is also written 
in Hof. 7, 5. But here the prophet begins to threaten the 
sins he told above. They are twofold. For the Jews 
sinned not only by using the wrong weight and measure 
out of avarice. For the Jews did not only sin by using 
wrong weights and measures out of avarice, but also by 
keeping their idolatry and not correcting their ungodly 
nature by the right teaching. 

Therefore, God's judgment is shown here, which is 
completely different from the judgment of men. The 
papists nowadays do not insist on their services and 
their teachings because they want to perish. For they 
think that in this way they will strengthen their empire, 
and they firmly believe that if they followed our teaching, 
they would lose their benefices, their incomes, the 
dignities they hold. So also the Jews, as it is said in 
Jeremiah [Cap. 44, 17.], did not sacrifice to the queen of 
heaven for the sake of it, because they wanted to perish; 
for they thought that this worship was the only cause of 
happiness and well-being. But what happens? It is 
precisely this worship that ruined the Jews, and no doubt 
it will also ruin our papists. For the more zealously they 
insist on their ungodly practices, the more they provoke 
the wrath of God against themselves, until they are 
finally exterminated altogether. 

It is similar with the sins against the second table. The 
rich think that unjust measure and fraudulent weight will 
add something to their goods. But goods gained in this 
way also consume those gained honestly. If, therefore, 
we were permitted to wish evil of every kind upon miserly 
men, what else could we wish upon them but that which 
they do, that they gather riches for themselves by fraud, 
lies and perjury? For there is no shorter road to 
destruction than this, as the prophet testifies, who calls 
the unrighteous goods a "good. 





Fire calls, and unjust measure the wrath of the Lord. 

But the world does not believe this. Therefore it deals 
only with this one thing and pursues it fiercely, that it may 
possess as much as possible. But this pursuit is followed 
by the certain misfortune peculiar to it, that the miserly 
and unjust people's honor is their own executioner; or 
that punishments are added, and they have 
extraordinary diseases, or that they become poor again, 
or on account of the goods become publicly godless 
people, or all these evils either altogether or in part pass 
on to the heirs. 

Therefore, we should rather act in such a way that we 
would not be anxious to gather goods, but how we would 
guard against sins. For then the wrath would cease, and 
that fire would stay away, but the blessing of the Lord 
would be there. For though thou hast not great goods, 
yet the Lord will give the daily bread, that is, as much as 
is sufficient, as he saith [Matt. 6:32], "My heavenly 
Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things." 
Likewise [v. 33], "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and 
all these things shall be added unto you.” And Ps. 37:26: 
"He is always merciful, and loveth to lend, and his seed 
shall be blessed,” that is, those who are generous and 
charitable will not only lack nothing, but the blessing will 
also flow to their descendants. But because the world 
neither believes nor does this, it must experience what 
the prophet here threatens his godless and unbelieving 
Jews. 


V. 14. You shall not have enough to eat, and shall 
faint (Tu comedes et non saturaberis, et oppressio tui 
in medio tui). 

Behold the tremendous wrath that this wickedness of 
men deserves. The daily bread is promised to the godly, 
but it is denied to the stingy people. Of the godly the Holy 
Spirit says [Ps. 37:25], "| have never seen the righteous 
forsaken, or his seed go after bread." But the stingy and 
dishonest people, even if they. Even if they have bread, 
they cannot satisfy their hunger with it.

1127 





Although this can also happen in times of peace because 
of the storm, the prophet has in mind the time of war, as 
it is now with the poor prisoners in Turkey. For these, 
though they have lived in the greatest abundance of wine 
and grain, have now scarcely so much as is sufficient to 
last them a lifetime. 


What he adds: Oppressio tui in medio tui, indicates 
that they will have no welfare, since the wrath of the Lord 
oppresses and depresses them. Therefore, this can be 
translated thus: From all sides you will be oppressed. For 
the Hebrew word means humiliation or oppression, as 
we say in German when we want to indicate the most 
adverse fate: "He cannot get over himself." He is 
oppressed by the hand of the Lord, so that he cannot 
rise. Thus it is written in the 38th Psalm, v. 7: XXXXXX, | 
am very oppressed. Our [Latin] translation has: 


Curvatus sum in finem. But he speaks there of the 
spiritual dejection, which arises from the feeling of the 
wrath of God and the sight of sins. 

And that which thou shalt receive shall not come of 
it; and that which cometh of it will deliver to the sword. 


The rabbis invent here | do not know what things of 
untimely births. But the prophet has a different opinion. 
For he wants to indicate that not only their bodies, but 
also all their goods will be in extreme danger. And the 
word "catch" shows the great effort to get out of their 
misfortune, that they, being afflicted with evils and 
surrounded, will try and undertake many things to wriggle 
out of the present misfortune. But the prophet threatens 
that these attempts will also be in vain. Not as if they 
would not achieve something from time to time, but that 
even if they have achieved something, it will melt away 
or fall into the hands of the enemy, as the following 
shows. 

V.15. You shall sow, and not reap; you shall press 
oil, and not anoint yourself with it; and you shall press 
must, and not drink wine. 


1) Erlanger: 








He who sows seems to have caught something and 
hopes for the harvest. But because of your sins, not only 
will you not reap what you have sown, but the enemy will 
trample it and destroy it. In this way, even he who has 
gathered olives and grapes seems to have caught 
something to enjoy. But because of your sins it will 
happen that you will not be able to save this nor to enjoy 
it, because this morsel is prepared for the enemies, 
which they will tear 2) out of your throat. 

These are sad pictures, but the outcome has shown 
that the Jews have suffered much more terrible things. 
And we have similar examples at the gates of Germany, 
yes, in Germany itself. For do you not think that the poor 
Hungarians and all Austrians have already sown many 
times what was trampled on by the enemies, the Turks, 
and pressed must that the cruel enemy has 
sacrilegiously spilled? But these sermons of the 
prophets are held up to us so that we, since it is certain 
that such things happen for the sake of our sins, may 
repent and amend our ways. 


V. 16. Demi man keep the way of Amri, and all the 
works of the house of Ahab, and follow their counsel. 
Therefore will | make thee a desolation, and the 
inhabitants thereof to be whistled at; and shall bear the 
reproach of my people. 


He remembers Amri and Ahab, who brought new 
idolatries to the people of Israel after Jeroboam. For 
Amri built Samaria and worshiped there against the 
commandment of God. Ahab also built a temple there to 
the idol Baal. Because of this ungodliness, the kingdom 
of Israel was laid waste by Salmanasser. And since the 
kings of Judah subsequently followed the same sins, this 
kingdom was also laid waste by the Babylonian 
Nebuchadnezzar, and the people were led away captive. 
For as covetousness and other sins against the second 
table are punished by famine, war and other calamities, 
so sins against the first table, ungodly sins, are punished 
by the first table. 


2) Erlanger: nodis instead of: vodis. 


1128 XXVI, 415-417. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 


Teachings, ungodly and idolatrous worship, as we have 
heard above, to be punished with the utmost desolation. 
This is shown by the example of the Jews, to whom, 
both in the Babylonian captivity and today, the fact that 
they were the people of God and so shamefully turned 
away from their God to idolatry and godless worship is 
the greatest disgrace. 





6, 16. 7, 1. w. VI, 2965-2970. 1129 


This is a glorious sermon of repentance, which is 
especially necessary in our time, so that we may 
improve our lives and our morals, and keep God's word, 
practice love and walk humbly before our God, and thus 
find grace with Him through Christ and be saved from 
the terrible punishments that are in store for the whole 
world because of sin. Amen. 


The seventh chapter. 


This is the last sermon of this prophet. In the 
beginning is a lament about the wickedness and 
ungodliness of his people, who had the word, but did not 
use it for repentance and correction, but continued safely 
in sins. Then a teaching or exhortation is added that the 
godly should rely solely on God and His word, and not 
be dissuaded from the word either by reputation or 
power, or by association with anyone or friendship. 

After this, a consolation is added that, although the 
captivity must be suffered for the sake of sins, God will 
not nevertheless reject His people, but will comfort His 
own, not only by bringing them back to the land of 
Canaan and taking vengeance on their enemies, but 
also by sending Christ, who will have a kingdom of grace 
and mercy throughout the whole world. In this way, the 
excellent teacher closes his prophecy with a very 
beautiful sermon about the kingdom of Christ and the 
forgiveness of sins out of pure grace and mercy, for 
nothing. But now let us interpret the text in order. 


V. 1. Oh, | am like one who slackens in the vineyard 
when there are no grapes to eat, yet he would like to 
have the best fruit. 


This is a lament. For it grieves a godly teacher that 
the perverseness 





of men is so great that the wicked not only do not mend 
their ways, but also deliberately grow worse day by day 
and sin more rampantly, while God sends His word with 
the intention that men may be warned and refrain from 
sinning, and escape future punishments, both temporal 
and eternal. 

But he uses the simile of the vineyard, which is also 
used by Isaiah Cap. 5, 2. For we have often seen that 
these two prophets, who taught at the same time, also 
use the same words. But this simile is taken from the 
song of Moses, Deut. 32, 32, where he says of the 
godless Jews: "For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, 
and of the field of Gomorrah; their grapes are gall, they 
have bitter berries." 

Christ also used this simile in Matth. 21, 41, where 
the scribes and Pharisees are prophets about 
themselves, that the vineyard will be given to others, but 
God will kill the evildoers. And Joh. 15, 1. Christ 
compares his church with a vineyard and interprets the 
single pieces of the parable very beautifully. For he says 
that he is the vine, but his disciples or the church are the 
branches; God, he says, is the vinedresser and purifies 
the vine by his word, so that it bears more abundant fruit. 
But just as the branches that are cut off from the vine 
cannot bear fruit, so, he says, it will happen. 


1130 L.XXVI, 417419. interpretations on the prophets,- W.VI, 2970-2973. 


1131 





if we abide in the vine of Christ, that we may bear fruit 
through Him, for it is He alone who gives the Spirit and 
the life. 

In this way, the prophet compares the people to a 
vineyard in this passage, but says that he is the vine 
dresser who has cultivated the same until now, but 
complains that he finds no fruit. 

The word XXXXX 1)translates Jerome 
by early figs, but in general it means the firstfruits of all 
fruits. But expressly the prophet says: My soul desired 
the firstfruits. For because he says that he cannot find 
them at the time of the harvest, one expects the tithes in 
vain, an abundance of grapes in vain. 

But this is part of the common annoyance that has 
plagued godly teachers at all times. For this is what the 
world is wont to do, to lay the infirmities of men upon the 
doctrine and upon the teachers, as our adversaries 
today, when they speak most abominably against our 
doctrine, press upon the fruits, lay upon us sedition, 
mobs, avarice, the tyranny of princes, and other things. 

But tell me, can we accuse Micah of either being too 
lax in teaching or not severe enough in punishing? For 
you will not dare to accuse his teaching. And yet he 
himself testifies that he saw no fruit of his teaching in the 
people; indeed, the more severely he punished the vices, 
the more they increased. What is the cause of this 
damage? Truly not the teachers, and much less the 
teaching, but Satan is the cause, who, while the people 
sleep, sows tares in the good field. This then grows and 
proliferates in such a way that the good seed is not only 
covered but completely choked. 

But this does not mean that a man must abandon his 
profession altogether or be negligent in his duties. For 
these two things are laid upon the teachers: first, that 
they may save their souls, as Ezekiel says [Cap. 3:19]. 
Secondly, that the ungodly world may have a public 
witness against them, 2) as Christ said. 


1) In the issues: Lsbuaab. 
2) Erlanger: Pabst instead of: badest. 


Says John 15:22: "If | had not come and told them, they 
would have had no sin: but now they have nothing to 
excuse their sin." 

In addition, there is a third reason, and the most 
important one, that the name of God must be sanctified, 
even if all others blaspheme; and there will always be 
some who accept the word. For God always has His 
Church where the Word is, even though it is distorted 
and almost suppressed by various aversions. 


V. 2 The righteous (sanctus) are gone from this 
land, and the righteous are no more among the people. 
They all lie in wait for blood; each one chases the other 
to destroy him. 


It is usual with the prophets that they express what 
they have said before in pictures, afterwards simply and 
without picture. This is exactly what Micah does in this 
passage. The grapes he sought in his vineyard were 
those of which he said in the previous chapter [v. 8]: 
"Keep God's word, practice love, and be humble before 
God." But since he seeks this among his people, he finds 
the opposite. He says, "The pious people are gone in this 
land, and the righteous are no more among the people.” 


The word sanctus, XXXX, has an active and 
passive meaning among the Hebrews, namely, he who 
has obtained mercy from God, and he who practices 
mercy toward others. For these two things must be with 
one another: that the servant who is forgiven a debt of 
ten thousand pounds should in turn forgive his fellow 
servant a hundred pennies [Matt. 18:28]. 


"The righteous" (rectum) he calls the one who walks 
on the right road and deviates neither to the left nor to 
the right, that is, the one who walks in the fear of God 
and hopes in His mercy. He says that such a one can no 
longer be found, because he saw that in prosperity all 
lived without fear and in the highest licentiousness, but 
in adversity either despaired or turned to carnal help. 

This is quite properly contrasted with what he said 
above, "Keeping God's word," that is. To pay attention to 
the word which 


1132 L. XXVI, 41S-42I1. Interpretation of Micah (1.), Cap. 


7, 2.3. W. VI, 2973-2976. 1133 





These two services command fear and confidence in 
God. If these services are not there, then follows that 
which the prophet remembers, "that all lie in wait for 
blood. 

Although this could be referred to the murder that 
ambition and avarice often induce, it is more correctly 
referred to the killing of the prophets who oppose the 
lusts of the world, as we see that those who freely attack 
the godless nature of the papists have to suffer 
persecutions and tortures of every kind. But since there 
are very few of them who obey the prophets who advise 
what is right, what do you think will happen when those 
who advise what is right are removed by cruelty? 

What he adds: "Every man chaseth another to 
destroy him" is the same as that which Isaiah Cap. 5:7 
f. says: "The Lord waiteth for justice, behold, it is 
drudgery; for righteousness, behold, it is lamentation. 
Woe to them that draw one hall to another, and bring 
one field to another, until there be no more room for the 
poor, that they alone may possess the land" 2c. He 
punishes at the same time the tyranny and the avarice, 
which goes with the godless ones in the swing. 

The hunt is a laborious thing. The dogs are used for 
force and the nets for cunning. And the hunter does not 
face the wild animals 1) unarmed, he is armed with 
spears, rifles and swords. Apply this to the courts of 
princes who pursue the goods and chattels of their 
subjects, to merchandising, to other profitable 
businesses, and you will find marvelous tricks by which 
all men are bent on gathering as much as possible, even 
if all the others should suffer want and perish from 
hunger. 


V. 3: They think they are doing well when they do 


evil. 


This is also a great folly, that the world not only 
excuses its sins, but also adorns them. Isaiah also 
complains about this army in the vineyard of the Lord. 


1) Erlanger: seris instead of: teris. 





[Cap. 5, 20]: "Woe to those who call evil good and good 
evil, who turn darkness into light and light into darkness, 
who turn sour into sweet and sweet into sour." 

But this happens most in the things concerning the 
Word and the Church. Since the Jews killed Stephen, 
they do not want to be considered as having sinned, but 
even seek the praise of godliness, because they killed 
him who blasphemed against Moses and God, Acts 6, 
13. 6, 13, as Christ prophesied [Joh. 16, 2?: "They will 
think 2) they are doing God a service by killing you." 

Do not the popes and bishops of today also think in 
this way that the evil they do is well done, since they 
defend and fortify their own, but condemn the true 
teaching of the Gospel as the most harmful heresy? But 
although they cannot defend the obvious shameful 
deeds they commit, as if they had done well in them, we 
see that they give free rein to their vapors in the utmost 
certainty, as if everything were well. Avarice in particular, 
however, is painted in the most beautiful colors, so that 
it is considered and honored not as a vice but as a virtue. 
Not even the most outstanding usurers acknowledge 
their usury, but defend even usury that takes more than 


twelve of a hundred in one year (Centesimam). Thus the 
wicked think that they do well when they do evil. 


What the prince wants, the judge says, that he 
should do him a service again (Princeps petit, judex 
munera accipit). The rulers advise according to their 
will to do harm, and turn it as they will. 


The prophet uses distributione here to show that all 
classes have become utterly corrupt and evil, who were 
supposed to inspire the others to godliness and 
respectability by their example. 

It is incumbent upon princes to provide for the welfare 
of their subjects, so that they may acquire their food in 
peace, and that the

For they not only do harm by their example, but also 
injure their neighbor. 

In this way Christ uses this simile, Matth. 7, 16: "Is it 
possible to gather grapes from thorns and figs from 
thistles? David also uses this image in his last words, 2 
Sam. 23:6, but he looks at the outcome, saying, "The 
transgressors will be plucked up like thorns. But our 
prophet looks more at their whole manner, that they prick 
like thorns, and yet have a very smooth bark. In this way, 
those who seek their advantage by harming others, and 
live most unrestrainedly in all deeds of shame, still 
disguise their ungodly nature. 


But when the day of your preachers comes, when

Here he also threatens the godless teachers who 
flattered the princes because of their avarice. They did 
not punish the vices, they did not threaten the sins with 
punishment, but also sat down against the godly 
prophets, as if what they had threatened the sinners 
would not come. Therefore he says: Because such is 
your way, the punishment and the divine vengeance will 
truly not slumber, but the day will come when your 
watchmen, that is, the bishops and teachers, will be 
accused of lying, and you will be afflicted by the Assyrian 
and the Babylonian, and then it will happen that those 
who comfort you now, who promise you glorious things, 
as if God would turn a blind eye to your sins for the sake 
of the temple and its worship, will be assailed by sudden 
terror and calamity, not knowing which way to turn. For 
this is the general meaning of the Hebrew word 


V. 5. 6. Let no man believe his neighbor, let no man 
trust in princes; keep the door of thy mouth from her 
that sleepeth in thine arms. For the son despises the 
father, the daughter sets herself against the mother, 
the cord is against the in-law; and a man's enemies are 
his own household. 

The prophet's complaint about the corruption of the 
morals of the whole people goes as far as this. 





and about the aggravations that raged with great 
impetuosity in all classes. Now he adds a very necessary 
warning to it. Jerome applies this to the false prophets, 


and Lyra follows him. The glossa ordinaria 1) refers it 
in an inconsistent way to the dignitaries in the church, 
whom one should honor but not trust. Those who follow 
the rabbis think that the prophet speaks in a worldly way 
against the unfaithfulness of men, as the old woman 
says in the comic poet: What can one believe now, or 
what can one believe? And indeed, the well-known 
precept of the Greeks is not useless: XxxxXxXxX XXXXXXX 
[remember that you must not trust]. For the recesses of 
human hearts are so deep, the corruption of character 
and morals is so great, that one does not know whom to 
believe. Nor is there a lack of examples; as Jerome also 
laments in this passage, that a son has longed for his 
father's life, a brother for another. For, as the poet says 
2): 

Vivitur ex rapto; non hospes ab hospite tutus, Non 
socer a genero. Fratrum concordia fara est. : 
Imminet exitio vir conjugis, illa mariti. Lucida 
terribiles miscent aconita novercae. Filius ante 
diem patrios Inquirit In annos. 

[One lives from robbery. The host is not safe from the 
guest, the father-in-law not from the son-in-law. There is 
seldom harmony between brothers. The husband is 
intent on the death of his wife, and she on that of her 
husband. The frightening stepmothers mix clear poison 
potions. The son counts the years until the death of his 
father. 

Since such examples are not infrequent, people are 
rightly reminded that they should not believe anyone 
lightly, and Scripture does the same reminding, but in a 
somewhat different way. For it forbids trusting in men in 
such a way that we should place all our confidence in 
divine help, which cannot fail. But the counsel and help 
of men deceives, indeed, brings about

Also often harm, as Isaiah says [Cap. 36, 6.] that the 
Egyptians would be like a reed stick to the Jews, which 
breaks when one leans on it and wounds the arm. And 
all the histories of the Gentiles are full of examples that 
show that those who have undertaken new things by 
trusting in human help have come to ruin. For this trust 
in man is a sin against the first commandment: "I am the 
Lord your God. Therefore, certain punishments follow 
the same. 

Therefore, as Scripture everywhere exhorts to trust in 
God, so it everywhere condemns trust in men. But it 


allows the trust, that | say so, oeconomicam et 


politicam, 1N the household and in the worldly regime. 
Paul says [1 Cor. 13:7]: Love is not suspicious. Since 
husbands are commanded to love their wives, distrust 
and suspicion must be completely removed from the 
married couple, as Solomon says, Proverbs 31:11: "A 
man's heart can rely on his wife." That is, he not only 
entrusts her with the management of the household, but 
also believes that he will be loved by her again and that 
she will not be moved by love toward others. This trust 
between husbands and wives must be there from time to 
time, unless facts should make it otherwise. 

Thus, a householder entrusts the domestic work to 
his servants. A prince believes that he is loved by his 
subjects. In turn, the subjects have the confidence that 
they are dear and valuable to their prince and that he 
cares for them. This trust not only nourishes love, but it 
is also the only bond for the heart and for all affairs. 
Therefore it is necessary and commanded by God. But it 
is, as | have said, a trust that concerns the household 
and the worldly government, and does not have to 
override trust in God. But because it can happen that we 
are deceived here and there, we must also ask God to 
preserve this bond of hearts, and at the same time 
careful attention and diligence are necessary. For often 
careless people, by their carelessness, give others 
cause to sin. If a householder has no care 





If a prince is not concerned with the work of the servants 
and governs them, it is no wonder that the servants 
sometimes either stop working or spoil something. A 
prince should also order others to take care of his affairs 
in such a way that he nevertheless governs himself to 
some extent. 

But as for the present passage, the prophet does not 
speak of the civil distrust which must sometimes take 
place because of the unfaithfulness of men; this memory 
must be referred to more important things. He has 
lamented that neither princes nor judges exercise their 
office, has also said of the lusts of private men. Now, 
therefore, he adds this warning, so that the godly may 
not also be distracted by such aversions into 
godlessness. For there is a great danger in the multitude 
of distractions, as the so many sermons of the prophets 
testify. In the 125th Psalm, v. 3, it says: "The Lord will not 
let the scepter of the wicked remain over the company of 
the righteous, lest the righteous also stretch forth their 
hand unto iniquity.” 

And Christ, Matth. 18, 8. f., warns seriously: "But if 
your hand or your foot offends you, cut it off and throw it 
from you. It is better for you to become lame or crippled, 
than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into 
eternal fire. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and 
cast it from thee. It is better for thee to enter into life with 
one eye, than to have two eyes, and be cast into hell 
fire." That is, don't let anyone make you angry, even if it 
seems that you can't do without them any more than you 
can do without an eye or feet. Tear out the eye, cut off 
the foot, and get rid of it however you can, do not consent 
2c. 

In this way, the prophet also preaches in this passage 
that we should not have such great regard for friends, 
that we should not have such great regard for princes, 
even that we should not have such great regard for those 
who are most closely associated with us, that we should 
be provoked by their example to depart from the word or 
to do contrary to the word; for they are men, whoever 
they may be. 


1140 L. XXVI, 428-430. interpretation of Micah (1.), Cap. 


7, 5-7. W. VI, 2985-2988. 1141 





Therefore, one must live to God's will and follow His 
word, for He is greater than man, and can snatch out of 
the misfortune that men cause, while on the other hand 
men deceive, and, though they do not bring us into 
danger, yet they leave us in danger. 


V. 7. But | will look to the Lord, and wait for the God 
of my salvation; my God will hear me. 


Here the prophet interprets himself. For what he said 
above in a negative way, he now says in an affirmative 
way and transfers the matter to his person. He says: Do 
not trust in men; trust in God, if you want to be preserved 
as | do. These words are full of faith and comfort. In order 
that we may understand them all the more correctly, we 
must direct our thoughts, as it were, to the matter at 
hand. 

This is the last sermon of the prophet who, as we can 
see, attacked the vices of his time with great courage 
and threatened punishment. And even with this he was 
not satisfied; he also shows the way how to improve life 
and reconcile the wrath of God. Since he now sees that 
the ungodly world does not heed the threats and the 
salutary teaching, but continues in sin, he does two 
things that are especially glorious. First, he does not let 
himself be moved by the aggravations of the godless 
crowd, but remains firm in his mind, and will not change 
it, even if for this reason he should make enemies of all 
men. This prophetic and heroic steadfastness is 
necessary above all for a faithful teacher. 

But the other thing is even greater, that he, since with 
such an ungodly life the punishment and vengeance of 
God could not be avoided any longer, does not abandon 
all hope, but turns his eyes to God, being sure that even 
though the general punishment should be like a flood of 
sin, God knows how to save and preserve His own, as 
Peter also says [2 Ep. 2, 9]. 

It is completely the same in our times. The world is so 
immersed in sins that nothing can be done. 





can expect other than a certain devastation of the whole 
of Germany. For not only the idolatry and blasphemies 
of the time of the Pabst deserved this, 1) but even 
greater causes of such punishment are the contempt of 
the revealed word, the ingratitude, the disobedience, 
yes, also the boundless licentiousness in all vices. 
Therefore, we too must follow the example of the 
prophet. First of all, we must not allow ourselves to be 
seduced by the astonishments and turn away to the 
ungodly nature. For let every one of us think in such a 
way that, even if the whole world were given over to 
fornication, avarice, eating and drinking, we would still 
want to live chastely, charitably and moderately. 
Secondly, that we do not completely abandon the hope 
of salvation, even though at this hour the Turk and all 
misfortune would come. 

The prophet was not supposed to see the destruction 
of Jerusalem. He saw the desolation of the kingdom of 
Israel and perhaps also the siege of Jerusalem, which 
happened by Sanherib in the eighth year after the 
kingdom of Israel was conquered. Therefore, these 
words of his go to the church that would be there at the 
time of the desolation, and are addressed to the small 
flock of the godly who saw that calamity. He instructs 
them not to give up hope of salvation, but to lift up their 
eyes to the Lord, who is a God of salvation and hears 
the prayers of His own. These are short words, but they 
weigh very heavily and comprehend the most important 
things. For they not only include a beautiful contrast, but 
also contain a very necessary lesson. 

| will take heed or "look to the Lord", he says, | will not 
follow those who have their righteousness, wisdom and 
power in mind, who trust in the riches and friendship of 
other people. For all that can be accomplished by men 
is deceitful. Therefore | will turn my eyes to him who is 
the almighty God; from his hand | will receive. The 123rd 
Psalm, v. 1. 2. paints such an attitude.

Interpretations on the Prophets. W. VI, 2S88-2SSI. 


1143 





| lift up mine eyes unto thee that sitteth in heaven. 
Behold, as the eyes of servants look on the hands of their 
masters, as the eyes of a maid on the hands of her wife, 
so our eyes look on the LORD our GOD, until he be 
gracious unto us." There is therefore a special emphasis 
in the word "to the Lord," for he opposes it to all human 
help. 

Secondly, he adds, "I will expect of the GOd of my 
salvation." A great faith, that he calls him "the GOt of 
salvation", who wants to and can save him. But he adds 
expressly, "mine," for only this is the right faith, which 


appropriates to itself (sibi 1pSl applicat) the mercy of 
GOtt and salvation. This GOD, he says, | will expect. 
Why does he add this? Certainly, to indicate that, 
although he is certain of his salvation, he does not want 
to dictate to God the time, the manner, or the center of 
salvation. For that would be tempting God, as if, if this 
time passed by unused, salvation would be impossible 
afterwards, as if salvation could only come to us in one 
way and by one means. Those who want to free 
themselves from this temptation wait until God Himself 
determines the right time and the way, for He is a helper 
at the right time, but what the right time is, He determines 
Himself. 

Third, he says, "My God will hear me." See how 
stubbornly he insists that he has God, as if the rest of the 
wicked do not have God. The wicked also have God, but 
an angry God, and the God of vengeance, not of 
salvation. But the prophet boasts of his salvation, and of 
his God, who does not take pleasure in the godless 
nature of the despisers of the Word. 

This my God, he says, will hear me. Why is that? Of 
course, because the prophet, while the help is going 
away, will not stop praying, will not cease crying for help. 
Because in this way, when we pray without ceasing, we 
prove to God our faith that we do not yet despair of his 
salvation; we also prove to God our patience that this 
delay does not make our hearts despondent. For this is 
a not uncommon temptation, that men, when they wait 
for help, and therefore 


and see that it is postponed, think that either God does 
not care about them or that their prayer is not pleasing to 
Him. Therefore, they leave the prayer pending out of a 
kind of desperation. 

But the prophet who waits and still hopes for salvation 
also persistently hopes that God will hear. Therefore, he 
indicates that he does not slacken his prayers, but rather 
that he continues to do so day by day in the hope of 
obtaining salvation, as Christ teaches in the parable of 
the unjust judge and of the friend who asked for bread in 
an insolent manner [Luc. 18, 5. ff. and 11, 5. ff.J]. Such 
commandments and examples should be before our 
eyes in all perils, so that we may awaken ourselves to 
persevering hope, 1) even when it seems that one must 
despair altogether. 


V. 8. Do not rejoice, my enemy, that | am down; | will 
rise again. And though | sit in darkness, yet the Lord is 
my light. 

The prophet has directed his ministry in regard to the 
sure and impenitent sinners, for he has punished the sins 
and threatened the most severe punishments. And so 
that he would not omit anything, he also indicated the 
way in which they could be reconciled to the Lord, 
namely, if they did not surrender to the aversions, but 
followed the word and looked to God. But when he sees 
that he is of no avail, he lets them go and pursue the lusts 
of their hearts. For with such people nothing remains but 
that they learn that what they laughed at when they heard 
from the prophets that it would come is true. 

Therefore, he now turns to the other part, to the godly, 
who let themselves be reminded by the sermons of the 
prophet, recognized their sins and repented, and 
nevertheless had to suffer the common misfortune at the 
same time according to God's determined decision. But 
he consoles them in the most beautiful way and promises 
that not only the enemies will suffer severe punishments 
for their cruelty, but that they will also be punished for 
their sins.

1144 L. XXVI, 432-434. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 


but also that Jerusalem will be rebuilt and become much 
more glorious than it has ever been. For although it has 
had all its neighbors as enemies until now, it will happen 
afterward that it will rule over all of them, and its enemies 
will show it honors of every kind. God will also give much 
more glorious signs of His favor than those in Egypt. But 
all this comfort must be related to the spiritual kingdom 
of Christ through the gospel. 

In the beginning there is an address to the Assyrians and 
Babylonians, by whom the people of Israel were most 
severely afflicted at various times. For the latter 
devastated the kingdom of Judah, the latter the ten tribes 
of Israel, and led the people away captive. It could not 
fail that the crude and godless Gentiles became arrogant 
because of these victories, as we see in Rabshakeh in 
Isaiah [Cap. 36, 2. ff.] and in Belshazzar in Daniel [Cap. 
5, 2. ff.]. For both are proud because of the victory, and 
blaspheme the GOD of heaven. They praise their idols, 
as if these had given them such great success, but 
despise the GOt of Israel and ridicule Him as a non- 
contentious GOt who had not been able to save His own, 
as they say here [v. 10.], "Where is your GOt?" This 
exceedingly great certainty of the wicked adds to the 
misfortune of the godly, that it seems to them as if they 
were completely forsaken by GOD, and think that there 
is no hope of salvation. For this is always the way of our 
flesh, if it is not governed by the Word of God and the 
Holy Spirit, that it is overconfident in prosperity but 
despondent in adversity. 

Therefore the prophet sees, as if it were before him, 
the faintheartedness of his own and the arrogance of the 
adversaries. Therefore he admonishes them not to exalt 
themselves because of the misfortune of his people and 
adds the causes, namely that it will happen that the fallen 
will rise again. This, however, is so that he may raise his 
people to the hope of salvation and fortify their wavering 
hearts. Therefore he says: "Do not rejoice, my enemy, 
that | am down." He sees that it belongs to humanity that 
we come to the aid of the fallen and either raise them up 
if we 


7, 8. w. VI, 2991-2994. 1145 


or at least let us be moved to mercy by their misfortune. 
But this is the fate of the church, that no one is moved by 
its misfortune, but that the enemies inflict one misfortune 
after another on it, and cannot be satisfied by any torture, 
however bitter. In this way Christ, the head of the Church, 
saw on the cross how the synagogue shouted for joy and 
mocked the dying man. But this mirth of the wicked and 
their laughter was of very short duration. Since Christ 
was scarcely laid in the tomb, and it now seemed that the 
satiated cruelty of his enemies would rest, a new and 
unusual fear seized them, that they were afraid even of 
the dead corpse, and Christ rising on the third day 
compels them that they must seek in falsehood an 
altogether untenable protection. For the enemies of 
Christ themselves are the messengers and witnesses of 
Christ's resurrection. In this way, the prophet also 
consoles his own, who lay depressed by heavy 
misfortune and therefore trembled in their hearts, while 
the enemies were joyful. He says: You will rise again. 
Truly a wonderful and almost unbelievable word for 
those who saw that they were so depressed that it 
seemed as if no human power 1) could raise them up. 
The largest part of the people was worn out by the war, 
the remaining were led away captive. An almost endless 
time of captivity was predicted by Jeremiah, namely 
seventy years; for very few of those who had seen 
Jerusalem returned to the land of Canaan. The other 
great multitude had been put forth in Babylon among the 
Gentiles without the fatherly ceremonies and customs. 
Therefore, it seemed that all would degenerate into 
pagans under so many and so great aergernissen of the 
godless Gentiles. And yet the prophet promises the 
certain hope that the people shall remain unharmed, 
saying, "I will arise again." And he was not mistaken, for 
the kingdom of Judah has been restored to its land, the 
walls of Jerusalem, though in puny time, are as

Daniel, until Christ finally came, and through the 
preaching of the Gospel the ten tribes of Israel were also 
resurrected and united with the true church of believers. 

But it is especially remarkable that the prophet adds: 
"Though | sit in darkness, yet the Lord is my light." For it 
can be held against the prophet: that lies in the distant 
future, what you promise; meanwhile all will be afflicted 
in various ways, but many will be carried away by death. 
What will happen to these? Verily, these promises, which 
will come to pass only after so long a time, will avail them 
nothing. Therefore, he answers that this calamity and 
death are like a terrifying darkness, which will be 
illuminated by a spiritual and eternal light, namely by God 
Himself, whose word shines like a light in a dark place [2 
Pet. 1:9], so that we will not become fainthearted and 
despondent because of the calamity. 

This is the glorious consolation by which all bodily 
adversity must be overcome, even death. For what is it 
when a man suffers from an incurable disease and is 
consumed, as it were, by a daily death? - What is it when 
he is imprisoned in Turkey? What is it when he suffers 
want and is oppressed by poverty? What is it when he 
endures other hardships, whether in the home or in the 
worldly regiment? Is not all this temporal, and has 
constantly this condition with itself, that it must become 
once differently, at least then, if with the life a change 
must proceed? Therefore these things, as the prophet 
calls them, are darknesses, and indeed terrifying ones, 
which we all by nature flee and abhor, for the flesh 
cannot but abhor this adversity. But look at the word, at 
this spiritual light of which the prophet speaks here, and 
you will realize that this darkness will be overcome by the 
light from which these rays of consolation burst forth: "A 
father chastens his son whom he loves" [Proverbs 
13:24]. "We are chastened of the Lord, lest we be 
condemned with the world" [1 Cor. 11:32]. "The 
sufferings of this time are the Lord's 





We are not worthy of the glory that will be revealed in us" 
[Rom. 8:18]. "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are 
heavy laden, and | will give you rest" [Matt. 11:28]. "l 
have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the 
wicked turn from his way of being, and live" [Ezek. 
33:11]. "The smoldering wick he will not quench" [lsa. 
42:3.]. "A troubled and a bruised heart Thou, GOD, wilt 
not despise" [Ps. 51, 19.]. "He that forsaketh father and 
mother for my sake, the same shall take it a hundredfold" 
[Matth. 19, 29.]. "He that loseth his life for my sake shall 
find it" [Matth. 16, 25.]. For there are innumerable 
sayings of this kind in the sermons of the prophets, the 
apostles and Christ, which shine before the godly in the 
midst of the feeling of misfortune, so that they do not 
despair, that is, they illuminate the darkness that is 
unbearable to the flesh. 

But it does not prevent that these hardships are 
punishments of sins, because the prophet confesses and 
acknowledges the sin immediately, in his person and that 
of all saints. The only thing that remains is that you also 
recognize your sins and do not persist in them. Even a 
father chastises his son for sins, and yet this very 
chastisement is the sign of a fatherly heart. Thus Paul 
says [1 Cor. 11:32] that we are chastened of the Lord, 
lest we be damned with the race. Therefore, the 
hardships that God imposes on the godly or penitent for 
the sake of sin are certain signs of God's grace and 
proper sacraments, as the epistle to the Hebrews, Cap. 
12, 5, beautifully interprets this very passage. They also 
become exercises of faith; they become works of 
obedience to God, and have the promise of eternal 
rewards. We too should see all this light with our eyes 
and with our heart, and then it will happen, as Paul says 
[Rom. 5:3-5], "that we may boast even in tribulations, 
knowing that tribulation brings patience, and patience 
brings experience, and experience brings hope, and 
hope does not bring to shame". For we know through the 
Holy Spirit, who is given to us, that we are loved by God, 
and that grace flows down upon us like a flood of sin.

8. XXVI, 437-439. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 7, 9. w. VI, 2997-3999.

v. 9 | will bear the LORD's wrath, for | have sinned 
against him, until he execute my cause and do me 
justice; he will bring me to the light, that | may see my 
delight in his mercy. 

Here he interprets more clearly what he said above 
about darkness and light. And in the beginning there is 
a glorious confession. He acknowledges that this 
misfortune comes from wrath, namely from the wrath of 
the Lord. Then, not covering anything up, he adds the 
cause: "I have sinned against the Lord, therefore | am 
smitten. 

Therefore, this passage contains by far the most 
useful lesson, that even in misfortune we should not 
merely lament and weep after the manner of women, but 
lift up our eyes and look for the cause of the misfortune. 
For then it will happen that we will not only firmly believe 
that we will be punished more easily than we deserve, 
and therefore be more patient and composed. But we 
should also refrain from sinning and live in the fear of the 
Lord, which is true repentance. 

Therefore, this passage contains the extremely 
important doctrine of repentance. For since he expressly 
says: "I will bear the Lord's wrath, for | have sinned 
against him," he thereby truly indicates that it will happen 
that sins will always be followed by their proper 
punishments. If an adulterer, a usurer, an ungodly 
despiser of the Word and the servant of the Word 
thought this to be certain, do you think that he would then 
sin so surely? They believe the opposite; for seeing that 
men can be deceived by an honorable appearance, they 
have confidence that they can also deceive GOD. For 
they think that God, like Cupid, 1) flies around among 
men with closed eyes without feeling, without caring 
about men in any way. Therefore, they sin so surely, 
without any fear that the punishment will follow, until, 
after the long time that God gives from the treasure of 
His goodness for repentance, the punishment seizes 
them. Then they lapse into a frightening apathy or 
despair, as the examples are before eyes, where iil your 
very slightest adversity an extra- 


1) Erlanger: eupictinsm instead of: Eupiclinkm. 


orderly consternation of hearts is felt. 

Therefore, this teaching is necessary, so that we may 
follow the example of the prophet in all misfortunes and 
dangers, and pay attention to the cause of the 
misfortune, and confess that our sins are not merely the 
cause of such misfortunes, but the real cause. Then it 
will happen that we will say with the prophet, with a 
humble and yet with a strong and constant heart, "I will 
bear the Lord's wrath," while the world, on the other 
hand, in the highest impatience, either despairs or looks 
for illicit help from men and devils. 

It may seem ridiculous that Basil, in a letter in which 
he laments the death of his mother, adds that this 
happened because of his sins. But truly, he who would 
have the least trouble flow from this source does not err, 
but lives finely in the fear of the Lord. 

Almost the same teaching is presented to us in the 
116th Psalm, v. 11. First, he laments that he is afflicted 
and freely confesses that all men are liars, that is, that 
all men are sinners before God and are justly punished. 
Afterwards he adds [v. 13.], "I will take the healing cup, 
and preach the name of the LORD," that is, | will bear 
the punishment patiently, | will present myself for 
chastening, and at the same time call upon the name of 
the LORD, since he will deliver me again, and as Micah 
says below [v. 18.], whose wrath is not eternal, but lasts 
only amoment. For this hope must be persevered in. For 
those who lose this hope cannot consider God to be a 
Father, but consider Him to be a tyrant who is eternally 
angry and leaves no room for forgiveness. 

But the prophet has expressed this hope very 
beautifully in this passage. He says: "I will bear the 
Lord's wrath," but not forever; | will bear it only until "he 
executes my cause and brings me justice. 

Dear one, how does this agree with each other? For 
he also confessed that he was a sinner and bore the 
wrath of God because of sins. And yet he says that God 
is in his cause. 


1150 L. XXVI, 439-441. 


Interpretations on the Prophets. W. VI, 3000-3004. 


1151 





Right will create. But what cause? What justice? What is 
due to a sinner other than punishment? 

This is true if you go by the law. But the prophet has 
another light to follow. He sees that the church in this life 
not only participates in the evils, but also that the church 
itself stumbles in many ways due to weakness. This, 
therefore, is the right that God establishes, and this is 
the thing that He carries out, that He both punishes the 
ungrateful world according to merit, and involves His 
Church in common dangers, so that it, chastened by the 
Lord, may recognize its sin, ask only forgiveness, live in 
the fear of God, resist the flesh, and not indulge in sin. 
Since the Lord does this by corporal punishment, like a 
kind father, he again caresses the children and accepts 
them back. This is the controversy and the judgment, 
that he smites, not that he may destroy, but that he may 
punish and destroy sin in us, but save us and comfort us 
again. 

Thus the church is burdened with many misfortunes 
in these last times. For the popes persecute the doctrine 
and want to protect the old idolatry, and the Turk rages 
cruelly, and with great success. Here, therefore, 
according to the example of the prophet, we must 
recognize the wrath of God and confess our sins, and at 
the same time hold on to this hope that the Lord, by 
striking us, will establish justice for us and guide our 
cause, namely, so that He may bring us to repentance 
through this ruth, and finally free and make holy those 
who repent, but destroy and condemn the Turk in his 
own time. 

Thus the prophet says here: "He will bring me to the 
light," that is, he will again comfort the captive and 
oppressed people, and | will see his righteousness, that 
is, "I will see my delight in his mercy," by which he 
justifies those who recognize their sins and hope in his 
mercy. For this piece explains what he said above about 
the "right," that you understand such a right, which is 
connected with the righteousness of God, that is, with 
the forgiveness of sins, that God will give those who 
recognize their sins and hope for His mercy. 





patiently suffer the deserved punishments, will forgive, 
have mercy on them and give them bliss. 


V. 10. My enemy will have to see it and stand with 
all shame, who now says to me, "Where is the Lord 
your God? My eyes will see that she will then be 
trodden down like dung in the street. 


The emphasis that lies in the word XXX is well known, 
for it means to look at something with special care and 
thought. Furthermore, this passage shows that God 
allows the temptations to become so strong that the 
wicked think that the Church is not only without God, but 
rejected by God altogether. But when it has come to this 
point, as it were to the peak of the contestation, then the 
hope must be held out that those who are now trodden 
down will be trodden down again. This consolation must 
also be applied to the other, spiritual temptations of sin 
and death. For faith and the mercy of God must 
necessarily retain the victory, even in the midst of death. 

But what shall we say to this? The prophet has 
accused the Gentiles above that they rejoiced over this 
misfortune of the Jewish people. But now he says that 
he himself wants to do what he condemned in the 
Gentiles, namely to look with joy at the downfall and the 
trampling of Babylon. Rather, it would have been fitting 
for him to have been moved by the misfortune of those 
as well and to have borne sorrow over it, but not to mock 
the afflicted, not to rejoice over their misfortune 2c. 

| answer: The enemies of the church have twofold 
sin, for they not only sin against the second tablet by 
treating the people of God exceedingly cruelly, but also 
against the first. For out of hatred against God and the 
right worship, they rage against the people of God. Since 
these people are handed over to punishment by God, 
not only is the church freed, but blasphemy is also 
prevented, and space is created for the Word and for the 
practice of divine service. Is this not worthy of joy and to 
be desired and implored with all our heart? Thus also 
writes the Lord's Prayer 


1152 L. XXVI, 441-443. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 7, 10-12. w. VI, 3004-3007. 


1153 





that one should ask for the sanctification of the name of 
God. But this is always connected with the downfall of 
those who blaspheme and persecute the Church and the 
Word of God. Therefore the saints do not rejoice in the 
destruction of the ungodly, for they would rather that they 
believed and were preserved; but since they do not want 
this, the saints rejoice and are glad that the Lord opposes 
the pretensions of the ungodly, that he does not allow his 
word and his worship to be completely suppressed, even 
though he allows [his own] to suffer for a time. 


V. 11: At that time your walls will be built. 


It is Known how Jerome interprets this passage. He 
connects it with the preceding, and draws it to the 
desolation of the kingdom of Babylon by the Medes and 
the Persians. But the opinion of the prophet is quite 
different. He has ended the consolations concerning the 
kingdom of the flesh, that the people should be brought 
back, and disturbed the heathen who held the same 
captive. 
Now he goes on to what followed the bodily restoration ofj 
the kingdom of Judah, namely that Christ would then be} 
revealed in the flesh and bring a new kind of teaching, ofj 
the forgiveness of sins by grace, free of charge. When| 
this time shall come, he says, the time shall be when thy| 
walls shall be built up. For only then will the throne of 
David's kingdom be confirmed, not the one that is on 
earth and will be destroyed like other kingdoms of the 
world, but a spiritual and eternal one, namely the kingdom 
of forgiveness of sins and eternal life. 


And God's word (praeceptum) far out. 


Here he interprets the "building" of which he said that 
Jerusalem will be built in such a way that the word! 


(praeceptum) will be spread into distant lands. For here 
is the word XX, which is used in the second Psalm [v. 7.] 
in quite the same sense, where the prophet preaches of 
the kingdom of Christ, and says that Christ will preach the 
commandment, namely this: "The Lord hath spoken to 





said to me, "You are my Son. For this is the word of the 
gospel, that Jesus, born of the Virgin Mary, is the Son of 
God, in whom the Father was well pleased, so that 
whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal 
life. 

This commandment of the Lord or this teaching 
began in Jerusalem and on Mount Zion, as was also said 
above. But it did not stop there, but spread out into the 
whole world, and this spreading out was the right bar of 
the city of Jerusalem, that is, of the kingdom of Christ. 
For so a great and infinite kingdom was prepared for 
Christ by the word of the Gospel, as the prophet also now 
interprets this more clearly, so that it is not necessary to 
invent strange and unruly opinions. 

But here also the contrast is to be noted. He does not 
say of the commandment of Moses that this should be 
spread among the Gentiles, that the Gentiles should be 
circumcised, that they should be required to sacrifice 
according to the law and other customs, for this 
commandment remained only with the people of God. 
But this commandment, that the Son should be heard, 
worshipped, kissed, that, he says, will be spread far and 
wide, from sea to sea, from the waters to the ends of the 
earth. For this reason, Christ also compares the gospel 
to leaven, which will penetrate the whole world, and to 
lightning, which travels suddenly from the beginning to 
the end and cannot be hindered by any human power. 


V. 12 And in that day shall they come unto thee from 
Assyria, and from strong cities unto thee, from strong 
cities unto the waters, from sea to sea, and from 
mountain to mountain. 


| pass over the useless games, whether it consists of 
two words, as the Septuagint translated, and Tyre is 
meant, or whether it is one word and means a fortress. 
For the prophet keeps here the usual way of speaking, 
which the other prophets have also used when they 
speak of the kingdom of Christ. Thus it is said in the 72nd 
Psalm, v. 8: "He will reign from a sea to a fortress. 


1154 k. XXVI, 443-446. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3007-3010. 


1155 





from one sea to another, and from the waters to the ends 
of the earth. Who does not see that Micah wanted to 
imitate this passage, as also Zechariah does, Cap. 9, 10: 
"He will teach peace among the nations, and his 
dominion will be from sea to sea, and from the waters to 
the end of the world. Here, therefore, it is not necessary 
to dispute which are the waters, which are the 
mountains, which are the strong cities of which the 
prophet speaks. For he wants quite generally and 
absolutely that the word of the gospel should be spread 
into the whole world. 


V. 13 For the land will be desolate because of its 
inhabitants, because of the fruit of their works. 


See the special care of the Holy Spirit. He sees what 
thoughts the godless synagogue will have in the future, 
that they will hope for a fleshly kingdom and not respect 
the word of the gospel. The Holy Spirit wants to remedy 
this error, which not only obscures the kingdom of Christ, 
but also abolishes it. Therefore, he adds of the land of 
the Jews that it will be desolate, that is, that the physical 
kingdom together with the priesthood and legal worship 
will be completely destroyed and laid waste. 

Therefore, what he said about the walls not at all 

referring to the physical Jerusalem, but to the kingdom 
of Christ, which is spiritual and is built by the word of the 
Gospel. If you do not follow this opinion, it is as if the 
prophet contradicts himself. For how is it true that 
Jerusalem shall be built, and all the land laid waste? But 
this does not dispute with each other, if it is understood 
of spiritual building. 
But where does this anger come from? Certainly 
"because of its inhabitants and because of the fruit of 
their works". Here he summarizes in short words the 
doctrine of repentance which all the prophets treat. The 
world is quite secure in all sins, but most of all in the sins 
against the first tablet, because it defends them and 
presses on them as a righteousness. For where is there 
a monk who thinks that he sins when he keeps the 
Sacrifice of the Mass? 


when he fasts, when he prays? And yet the saying is true 
[Rom. 14:23], "That which is not of faith is sin." But since 
a monk offers mass, fasts, prays according to his way, it 
is impossible for him to believe, because he has no word 
by which he is commanded to do these things in such a 
way. 

Although the sins against the second table cannot 
always be excused by the wicked, we see that their 
security is increased by the fact that God does not 
punish them immediately. Therefore, the miser 
continues in his miserliness, and heaps up riches 
wherever there is opportunity, the fornicator pursues his 
fornication 2c. 

But what will finally be the end of such doing? 
Certainly what the prophet indicates here: "The land will 
be desolate because of its inhabitants, because of the 
fruit of their works. Their deeds are evil, and therefore 
evil fruits are born of them. But this will be the end, that 
the tree will finally be cut down and thrown into the fire. 
This is the general rule that is held against all who do not 
repent. 


V. 14 But feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of 
thine inheritance, which dwell both in the forest alone, 
and in the field; let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as 
of old. 


This piece is, as it were, a prayer of the Church that 
believes the Gospel and sees that downfall of the 
synagogue. 

Furthermore, every single word must be carefully 
considered. It is something great that the church that 
believes the gospel calls itself the people of God. For 
this was previously the name of the synagogue, which 
had the law given to it by God, the circumcision, the 
sacrifices, the Temple, the prophets, the fathers. These 
were glorious testimonies by which God testified that this 
people belonged to Him. What similarity has the church, 
which is gathered from the remnants of the Jews and the 
Gentiles? which also departs from the law. And this was 
also the reason why the synagogue set itself against the 
gospel with such great power. 


1156 L. XXVI, 446-448. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 7, 14. w. VI, 3010-3013. 


1157 





Therefore, if you follow the outward appearance, the 
synagogue had greater and more testimonies than the 
church of the New Testament. For here you do not see 
the temple, not the circumcision as a sign pronounced to 
the body, not the magnificent services. Therefore the 
church of the faithful in this place itself confesses that it 
dwells both in the forest alone, and out of the field, while 
the synagogue dwelt, as it were, in a very well-kept 
garden, and in an exceedingly strong city. For that which 
she has is without all outward appearance. The 
forgiveness of sins and eternal life are held out to her, 
but only in word. The sign of this promise is baptism, by 
which the skin is washed away; likewise the Holy 
Communion; these are ridiculous spectacles to the 
Gentiles and the Jews, even to the Papists. For to them 
it seemed too little to be baptized with water, therefore 
they devised another more brilliant baptism, namely the 
vows of the monks. They abjured marriage, not of food, 
not of clothing, not of other things used in a mean way. 
And these they considered glorious marks worthy of the 
people of God, and called those who had them spiritual 
people and the people of God. 

But the wretched and double-blind people do not see 
that the church and the people of Christ are a spiritual 
kingdom. Therefore, it has no outward characteristics 
other than those that are very contemptible, namely, the 
word of the forgiveness of sins, baptism into the death of 
Christ, and the Holy Communion. When the pagans, the 
Jews and the papists look at these, they consider them 
small, because they do not consider what these things 
are based on, namely the blood of the Son of God. 

But the church pays attention to it and recognizes this 
treasure. She sees that the Son of God is given and born 
to her, as the prophet [Isaiah, Cap. 9, 6] speaks. Yes, 
she sees that he was also killed on the cross for us, so 
that we might live. She recognizes that the word of the 
Gospel, baptism and Holy Communion are sealed with 
the blood of the Son of God. Therefore, it boasts with 
truth that it is God's people. 

For compare hiemit the law, the Be 


the sacrifices, the temple, the land of Canaan, and 
everything else that this people had, and of which they 
boasted highly. Dear one, what is this against the blood 
of the Son of God? Furthermore, if what is decreed and 
done by God's commandment does not deserve to be 
compared to this. Dear, where then will the vows of the 
monks, the impure celibate state and other things of this 
kind remain, which are invented by men, but nowhere 
commanded nor approved by God? 

Therefore, with the prophet, we do not describe the 
Church or the people of God as the carnal Israel, which 
was adorned with circumcision, endowed with the land 
of Canaan, ordered by God with ceremonies and laws. 
For if one were to describe the people of GOD in this 
way, one would be forced to exclude all the fathers who 
were before circumcision; for these things were the 
adornment of an outward kingdom. But the people of 
GOD are and always were those who believed in the 
promised Seed. Therefore, in the Church there were 
always the promises of the Seed, and after this Seed 
appeared, it is commanded to us, not only by the Word, 
but also by Baptism and Holy Communion, both of which 
are instituted so that we may know that the Son of GOD 
was given to us and sacrificed for us on the Cross 2c., 
just as before the appearance of this Seed, the sacrifices 
were the models of this sacrifice that was to be offered 
through the Son of GOD. 

This description of the people of God is true and 
certain, therefore one can base a certain judgment on it. 
For wherever there is not the blood of the Son of God, or 
faith in the promised Seed, there is not the people of 
God, even though there is the law, sacrifice, good 
conduct, power and prosperity, and all that can be 
desired or praised by men. 

But just as the church of the faithful has snatched the 
name and title of the people of God from the synagogue, 
and calls itself the people of God, so it also snatches the 
glorious name of the inheritance of God from the 
synagogue and calls itself the herd of the inheritance of 
God. Until now, the synagogue had had this title, for this 
people alone the Lord had inherited. 


1158 L. XXVI, 448-480. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3013-3016. 


chooses to dwell in it, to speak with it, to protect it; in it 
Christ was to be born. But since the synagogue did not 
want to accept Christ and his gospel, it was cast out, and 
the church of believers was accepted as an inheritance, 
as David says in the second Psalm [v. 8]: "Cry out from 
me, and | will give you the Gentiles as an inheritance", 
as if he wanted to say: This is too little for Christ, that he 
has the Jews who spurn the gospel, he must be the Lord 
of the whole world. 

As far as this passage is concerned, the church, 

which recognizes that it is the people and the herd of 
Christ's inheritance, asks him to feed them with his staff. 
Here, first of all, a different nature of this king is indicated 
than that of the kings of the world. For these rule and 
enjoy the labors of their subjects. But Christ, as a 
shepherd, cares for his subjects, he lays down his life for 
them. He does not flee from the wolf, as the hirelings do, 
but throws himself against the wolf, so that the sheep 
may be provided with safety. 
But he expressly says, "Feed me with thy rod." For here 
is the word which is found in the 23rd Psalm, v. 4: "Thy 
rod and thy staff comfort me." He does not, therefore, 
want the rod of Moses, which chastens the erring sheep, 
but that by which the pasture is shown, and the wolves 
are kept away. For the church sees that it constantly 
needs the protection of the Word against Satan and his 
members. And there is no other means against spiritual 
malice and deceitfulness than the rod of the shepherd, 
that is, the word of the gospel, which shows that the 
prince of this world is judged. 

This danger is beautifully indicated by the prophet, 
when he says that this host dwells alone in the forest, 
where there is a great multitude of ferocious wild beasts, 
and therefore all the greater danger for the host. For he 
indicates that the church is surrounded on all sides by 
enemies, as Christ says [Matt. 10:16.], "Behold, | send 
you as sheep into the midst of wolves." Yet even in this 


1159 


It belongs here that he adds: "Let them feed in 
Bashan and Gilead." These were fertile pastures in the 
kingdom of Israel. But the prophet also wanted to indicate 
that the rest of the kingdom of Israel would return to the 
kingdom of Christ. But the prophets, when they speak of 
the kingdom of Christ, like to use the likeness of the 
former kingdom, which was a model of the future one, as 
shortly after Micah also uses the likeness of the exodus 
from Egypt. But for this reason this is not to be taken from 
a bodily restoration, as Jerome and after him Lyra do. 
This is figuratively speaking and denotes a great 
abundance, in teachers and in words. These are the 
happy pastures, Basan's and Gilead's in this kingdom, 
which the sheep of Christ desire and ask for. 


V. 15. | will make them see miracles, just as when 
they came out of Egypt. 


The prayer is answered. For he promises that he will 
also take care of this people, just as he did for the old. 

Lyra refers to the people brought back from captivity, 
just as the Jews do. But who does not see that the people 
of the law after the captivity saw nothing of the glory and 
the miracles that the first Israel saw in Egypt. Therefore 
Daniel [Cap. 9, 25] promises that the walls of Jerusalem 
will be rebuilt, but "in a short time", that is, not without 
great dangers and adversities. 

That the Lord therefore says: "I will make them see 
miraculous signs, as at the time when they went out of 
Egypt", can truly not be understood of the people of the 
law and of the fleshly kingdom. This belongs to the 
kingdom of Christ, through which a far more glorious and 
better salvation has taken place than that which was in 
Egypt. For Christ did not deliver his church from a tyranny 
of men, but he saved it from death, from sin, and from 
the tyranny of the devil. These siud the spiritual and 
eternal enemies of the human race, and cannot be

That is why he says the forest is on Carmel, in a fertile 
place.

1161 





Son become the sacrificial lamb. He alone bears the sins 
of the world, as the Baptist says [John 1:29], and does 
enough for them, so that those who believe in him may 
have forgiveness of sins, the Holy Spirit and eternal life. 
Is this not an infinitely greater possession than that of 
the land of Canaan, which was granted to the people of 
the Law? 

But why does he call it "miracles" or admirable 
things? Rather, those things were miracles among the 
ancient people, when the sea parted, when the Jordan 
stopped its course while the people passed through, 
when the sun receded by the space of several hours 2c. 

But just as the redemption in the New Testament was 
much greater and more glorious than that from Egypt, so 
also the miracles are infinitely greater. For what can be 
said that is more marvelous than that the Son of God 
takes on the flesh of a man and is born of a virgin? What 
is more marvelous than that the Son of God, struggling 
with death and the devil, allows himself to be overcome, 
offers his life to these enemies and, while being 
overcome, overcomes? Thus it is the highest miracle 
that the man Christ, who died on the cross, rises again 
on the "third" day from death and the closed grave, and 
goes to heaven with his flesh, which was immortal 
thereafter, and sits at the right hand of God. What can 
be said, or even conceived, that would be equal to these 
miracles? But this alone is not in the kingdom of Christ, 
for the prophet also thinks of other things: 


V. 16, 17: That the heathen may see, and all their 
mighty men be ashamed, and lay their hand upon their 
mouth, and stop their ears. They shall lick dust like 
serpents, and tremble in their holes like the creeping 
things of the earth; they shall be afraid of the LORD 
our God, and shall be astonished at thee. 

Lyra agonizes here in many ways by drawing this on 
the people who were brought back from captivity. But if 
one looks at the New Testament and the preaching of 
the Gospel, everything becomes easy and is well suited. 
Christ redeems the 





The rest of the Jews in a miraculous way. Since these 
miracles are preached by the apostles among the 
Gentiles, they are also added to the church, which is 
also rightly considered an exceedingly great miracle. For 
first, "they and all their mighty ones are put to shame," 
that is, they recognize that their religion, their worship, 
and all the trust they had placed in idols is void. For that 
is actually to become ashamed, when you see that you 
have been deceived, that you have placed your hope in 
something void, yes, that you have most offended the 
true God, since you thought that you worshipped him in 
the most holy way. 

This shame is followed by "-they put their hand on 
their mouth," that is, they will no longer preach these 
idolatrous services of theirs, but will rejoice that they 
have been taken out of the mouth and out of the memory 
of all men. 

The third is "that they also stop their ears," that is, 
that they not only do not teach idolatry themselves, but 
do not even want to suffer hearing others teach it. 

The fourth is, "that they lick dust like serpents. By this 
image the prophet not only shows the outward 
humiliation, but also the cause of the humiliation, namely 
the knowledge of sin and the feeling of the curse 
because of sin. Therefore, he also uses the simile of the 
serpent that is cursed because of man's sin, Gen. 3, 14. 
Furthermore, an excellent image of this feeling of the 
curse is presented to us in the adulterer David, since he 
is punished by the prophet [2 Sam. 12, 7. ff]. 

What he adds of the "worms" also belongs to these 
terrors of the conscience. As the prophet interprets 
himself, "they will fear the Lord our God and be terrified 
of you". This fear is in truth the beginning of wisdom and 
salvation. For those who are thus terrified and afraid 
listen to the most eager Christ, who teaches about the 
forgiveness of sins and eternal life, and take the 
kingdom of God by force, Matth. 11, 12.

Furthermore, this does not take place only at one 
time, for wherever and whenever the gospel is taught, it 
bears fruit among the Gentiles in this way, as our 
experience also testifies. For how great was the zeal to 
buy masses! How frequent the invocation of the saints! 
How much was spent on pilgrimages! How much on the 
adornment of the churches! 2c. All this is so driven from 
our hearts by the Gospel of the death of the Son of GOD 
for our sins that we are horrified even at the mention of 
such idolatry . . 

But, you will say, not all of them do this. For so many 


meetings [of the princes] (cConventus) prove how nothing 
at all the greater part of the princes wants to change this 
idolatry, and they are joined by the sacrilegious sophists. 
These do theology in a new way. They do not want to 
recognize any infirmity neither in the old doctrine nor in 
the ceremonies, but defend even blatant blasphemies in 
the most impudent way. How does this rhyme with this 
promise of the prophet? 

| answer: Nowadays the Gospel is no better than 
when Christ and the apostles preached it. For the gospel 
is preached only to the poor; the great, the mighty, and 
the wise of the world hate and persecute it. After that they 
find their priests who defend the Baal service and 
persecute the godly Elijah. But it is enough for the 
prophet that among all the nations where the gospel is 
preached, such fruits will surely follow that some will see 
these miracles and be converted to faith in the Son of 
God, who became the sacrifice for the sins of the world. 


V. 18-20. Where is such a God as thou art? Who 
forgiveth sin, and pardoneth iniquity unto the remnant 
of his inheritance; who keepeth not his wrath for ever: 
for he is merciful. He will have mercy on us again, curb 
our iniquity, and cast all our sin" into the depths of the 
sea. You will be faithful to Jacob and merciful to 
Abraham, as you swore to our fathers long ago. 





Here is one of the most glorious passages in all of 
Scripture, in which we are instructed about the gracious 
will of God toward us. This part, however, serves to 
explain the preceding, so that we may clearly understand 
what it is that the walls of Jerusalem are to be spread, 
what the pasture is for the host of the Lord, and what the 
miracles are that God shows to His people, namely the 
preaching of the Gospel, which teaches us about God in 
a completely different way than both the law and our 
reason. Therefore, as the redemption through the Son of 
God is full of miracles, so is the teaching of the Gospel, 
which teaches about this redemption, full of miracles. 
We human beings are all such that, if we look at 
ourselves and all that is ours quite closely, we must 
confess that we are sinners. For the fact that we know 
God's will from the law does not make it easier for us, but 
rather increases sin, as Christ shows in the parable of 
the servant who knows his master's will, but does not do 
it. Therefore, if we want to judge according to the law 
what kind of judgment awaits us, it is obvious what we 
have to hope for. For God Himself preaches in the law 
[Ex. 20:5]: "I, the Lord thy God, am a zealous God, 
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto 
the third and fourth generation that hate me, and 
shewing mercy unto many thousands that love me and 
keep my commandments. 

It is impossible to look at this sentence without immense 
fear and sorrow of heart. For we cannot deny the sins, 
and the inevitability of the punishment inevitably brings 
the thus frightened hearts into despair. Therefore, a 
frightened mind looks around for help and falls into 
hypocrisy on this occasion, as the examples of Pabstism 
show; for those who wanted to escape sadness in this 
way turned to the merit of the saints, to their own good 
works, to the monastic life 2c. For what else can reason 
do, which has no other knowledge of God than that which 
is prescribed in the Law, namely that God is good toward 
the good and evil toward the evil, as Micah also said 
above. This knowledge 


1164 L. XXVI, 45S-457. interpretation of Micah (1.), cap. 7, 18-20. w. VI, 3022-3025. 


1165 





niss drives either to despair or to hypocrisy and the futile 
protection of works. 

Therefore, Micah turns his eyes away from the law 
and does not want to know such a God who is angry with 
sins and sinners, but describes another God, namely the 
one who does not punish sins but remits them. This is a 
doctrine that seems to be completely at odds with the 
law. Therefore, it behooves us to look at the causes of 
both doctrines, why God threatens sinners through the 
Law, and why He comforts sinners through the Gospel 
and promises them mercy. And we see both in the 
sermons of Micah. The sermons addressed to the people 
of that time are legal, and make GOD a terrible avenger 
against the sinners. But the sermons about the kingdom 
of Christ do not threaten punishment, but promise 
forgiveness of sins. 

Is the prophet arguing with himself, or is the word of 
God wrong? Not at all. But just as the fear of God and 
faith in the heart do not conflict with each other, so the 
teaching of the Law and that of the Gospel do not conflict 
with each other, if only they are interpreted correctly. The 
law threatens sinners with wrath, so that people may 
recognize their sins and humble themselves before God; 
but the gospel promises grace to the humble through 
Christ, who has both paid for sins and earned eternal life 
for all who believe in him, as he says [John 11:26]: 
"Whoever believes in me will never die." 

Therefore, it remains eternally true that God will be 
angry with sinners who do not repent, and will also 
condemn sinners who do not repent and humble 
themselves. Therefore, it remains eternally true that God 
forgives the sins of the penitent, or the brokenhearted, or 
the humble, and those who believe in Christ. And this 
opinion is beautifully indicated by the prophet himself. 
Above he threatened misfortune of every kind, both to 
the kingdom of Judah and to Israel; but to those who are 
humbled in this way he promises grace and forgiveness 
of sins. 

But here in Hebrew there are two after 





expressive words: and "wp. The first one is used by 
David in the 32nd Psalm, v. 1: "Blessed is he whose 
transgressions are forgiven"; in Hebrew it means: he who 
is rid of transgressions. And John seems to have imitated 
this image, since he says [John 1:29] that the Baptist 
called Christ the Lamb of God: xxxxxx xxx XXXXXXX XXX 
XXXXxXxX, who takes away sins, so that you may 
understand that sin is an unbearable burden and presses 
us down to the depths of hell, from which burden, 
however, we are freed so that the Son of God takes it 
upon Himself and relieves us of it. 

The other word means to pass by, to pass over. This 
also beautifully illustrates the mercy of God, who, if we 
believe in Christ, does not allow himself to be endured 
by our sins. He passes over them or passes them by as 
if they were things that are not worth dwelling on, just as 
a wanderer pursues his way and does not care what he 
encounters as he walks. For God is well pleased with His 
Son; those who believe in Him, He passes by their sins, 
not inquiring after them. 2c. 

But exceedingly beautiful is what the prophet adds: 
"He does not keep his anger forever." For here he 
summarizes both, that God is angry with sins and 
punishes them, and yet that he does not let this anger 
rage persistently without measure, but abates it when we 
humble ourselves before God, that is, when we 
recognize sin and ask for forgiveness through Christ and 
hope for it. This, therefore, is the doctrine that instructs 
hearts that are frightened by fear of death and the wrath 
of God, that although God is angry, as we feel His wrath 
in many ways, He is not angry forever, but sets a 
measure to the wrath when we repent, as Ezekiel also 
teaches, Cap. 18, 23. and 33, 11. 

But what is the cause of this goodness? Is it merit? 
Some intercessions of the saints? Some other things that 
people make up? Not at all, but what the Prophet says: 
XXX XXX XXXXX, because you have 
your joy in doing good, because you are merciful, "it is 
your heart and desire to people

that is in the world should serve him, is merciful and 
kind? Then, is He not merciful and kind, who did not 
reject man fallen into sin and death, but promised him 
salvation through the Blessed Seed? If you consider this, 
how can you think differently of God than the prophet 
does here? 

But because this knowledge of God brings life and 
blessedness, Satan tries to suppress it in many ways. He 
raises false prophets who teach reliance on works and 
merits, as the entire Pabstacy does. Then he paints a 
completely different picture of God in our hearts than the 
one described here by the prophet. For he frightens with 
the sins, he presents death before our eyes in such a 
way that this friendly appearance of God disappears 
completely from our hearts and eyes, and another, 
tyrannical one is put in its place, as if God, once he has 
begun to strike, does not know how to find an end to his 
wrath. Therefore, hearts flee from God, and begin to hate 
Him, and fall into despair. 

Therefore, this sermon of Micah must be carefully 
recorded, in which he presents God as merciful and kind, 
just as Christ does John 3:16, when he says: "God so 
loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son. He 
does not say that he hates the world, that he abhors it or 
rejects it, but that he loves it and gives it the highest 


way, Rom. 6, 6: "Our old man is crucified together with 
him, that we should serve sin no more." Likewise [v. 12.], 
"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to render 
it obedience in its lusts." But these sayings arose from 
Adam's sermon to the murderer Cain, where he 
commands him that he should rule over sin and resist it. 

Therefore, the prophet understands here a twofold 
benefit, the forgiveness of sins and the Holy Spirit. For 
first of all, sin is so trampled on or destroyed that it cannot 
accuse or condemn us. For for Christ's sake it is 
reconciled and forgiven. Then the Holy Spirit is given to 
believers so that they may rule over sin in truth, that is, 
resist it, put it to death, and awaken themselves to right 
and voluntary obedience 2c. 

Furthermore, it is not inconsistent to refer what he 
says about the sinking of sins in the sea or in the water 
to baptism. In truth, sins are washed away and canceled 
by the blood of Christ (for we are baptized into the death 
of Christ). Thus Peter [1 Petr. 3, 21.) used a similar image 
of the flood of sins, and the Fathers transferred many 
similar passages of the prophets to baptism. 

The last part, about the faithfulness and mercy 
promised to the fathers and faithfully kept, serves to 
teach us that the cause of such great benefits is none 
other than that God is merciful by nature. Therefore, he

in their song [Luc. 1, 54. f.]: "He remembers mercy, and 
helps up his servant Israel, as he spoke to our fathers, 
to Abraham and his seed forever." And Zacharias, the 
father of John the Baptist, Luc. 1, 72. f.: "He 
remembered his holy covenant, and his oath, which he 
swore to Abraham our father" 2c. 

In this way we see how diligent a teacher Micah is, 
who so beautifully combines the teaching of the Law and 
the Gospel. To the law belongs what he preached in the 
first chapter of the punishments of idolatry, in the second 
and third of the punishments of avarice, and in the sixth 
of false worship. Since similar sins burden Germany, it 
is easy to see what we have to expect, especially since 
we have a cruel enemy in such close proximity. 

To the gospel belongs what he prophesied about 
Christ and his kingdom in abundance. For he taught 
about the person of Christ that he was to be born in 
Bethlehem and that he was the Son of God who had 
been from eternity. Then he also taught about the 
kingdom of Christ that it would begin in Jerusalem and 
then spread throughout the whole world. 





but in such a way that the other nations will all go in the 
name of their God, that is, that the world will have its own 
worship services, and the true church, while seeking to 
fortify them, will be in danger, but will not be completely 
suppressed. These and other things have a manifold 
benefit, for they straighten the troubled hearts, they 
teach, they increase the faith, they awaken to prayer 
with the certain hope of being heard. Therefore, we 
rightly thank God through Christ for this rich knowledge 
and pray with the prophet, as Jerome does at the end of 
his interpretation: 

O God, who is like you? who forgives sin, and 
pardons iniquity to the remnant of his inheritance; who 
does not keep your wrath forever, but wills to be 
merciful. Thou hast turned again to us, and hast had 
mercy upon us. Thou hast subdued our iniquity, and cast 
all our sins into the depth of the sea. This mercy keep us 
for ever, that we may walk in the light of thy word, and 
escape all dangers that threaten us from Satan and from 
the world, through JEsum Christ, thy Son and our 
Redeemer. Amen, amen, amen. 


End of the interpretation about the prophet Micah. 


The main teachings and sayings from the sermons of the prophet Micah. 


The first chapter. 


The first chapter contains the prophecy of the 
devastation of both kingdoms by the Assyrian Sanherib. 
For though he was cut off by the angel from the gates of 
Jerusalem, and his own suffered a tremendous defeat, 
yet he greatly afflicted the kingdom of Judah. 

The cause of this calamity, he says, was idolatry, that 
they forsook the true GOD and the temple appointed for 
the holy services, sacrificed to idols, and chose unholy 
places, as the histories of the 


Kingdom of Israel and Judah at the time of Ahaz. 

This teaching is useful for our times. For the idolatry, 
which was manifold, even infinite, in the papacy, has 
been brought to light by the gospel. Therefore, those 
who do not reject it, but insist on it, as the godless crowd 
of bishops and sophists do, will undoubtedly bring 
devastation upon themselves, as the examples of the 
churches are before our eyes, which the Turk, Christ's 
enemy, most cruelly destroyed. 


1170 UVL, 462-464. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3032-3035. 


1171 





This chapter contains a particularly noteworthy 
saying [v. 7] that the goods of the whore shall again 
become the wages of a whore, that is, that one idolater 
corrupts another, just as today those who want to be 
considered the highest defenders of papal dignity 
plunder the monasteries and church goods acquired 
through idolatry. 


The second chapter. 


The second sermon contains a severe accusation 
against avarice, which is the source of injustice and 
violence. But the Lord also threatens the miser with 
destruction. 

And here, above all, the security of the ungodly is to 
be noted, even in manifest sins. For the Jews thought 
that they could sin all the more licentiously because they 
were the people of GOD, and were puffed up by the 
promises. But the saying of the prophet is well to be 
remembered. "My sayings," says the Lord [v. 7.], "are 
kind," or promise good things to the good. Since you are 
evil, how can evil remain longer far from you? Therefore, 
the judgment stands firm that God will punish sinners if 
they do not repent and turn from their sins. 

After this legal sermon, the prophet adds a promise 
of Christ all, whom he presents as a shepherd who 
gathers the rest of the faithful [v. 12]. He also calls him 
[v. 13] a "breaker" who will destroy the kingdom of the 
devil, death and sin, and gives the consolation that it will 
happen that the church, since Christ goes ahead, 
protects and helps, will overcome all these evils, and 
thus break through from the misery of this life to eternal 
life. But also this is to be noted, that he attaches to our 
Lord Jesus Christ the ineffable name of God [Jehovah]. 


The third chapter. 


As he has accused avarice in general in the second 
chapter, so he punishes here in particular the avarice of 
the authorities, both secular and ecclesiastical. But he 
threatens [v. 4] that it will happen that, when they come 
to the 





He will not hear them, that is, he will give them up to the 
sword and hand them over to the enemy, who will rage 
against them again as they raged against their subjects. 

And in this sermon there is an excellent comparison 
of the false prophets with the right teachers [v. 5 ff]. The 
latter are full of the spirit and freely punish the sins of the 
rulers and the people. The latter close their eyes against 
sins for the sake of gain, and promise all good things 
even to the impenitent. 


The fourth chapter. 


This is a glorious prophecy of the kingdom of Christ. 
First, the place is named that this kingdom will begin in 
Zion [v. 1 f.]. 

Secondly, he promises that it will happen that the 
Gentiles also will seek this kingdom [v. 2]. 

Thirdly, he says [v. 2.) full of the king's office, that the 
king himself will teach his ways by a new word and a 
new law, that is, by another than that of Moses. For this 
accuses the sins and threatens the sinners. But this, 
Christ's word, forgives sins and promises the Holy Spirit 
through Christ's merit and death. 

Therefore (this is the fourth) this teaching is followed 
by peace of conscience and manifold fruit, as the 
prophet says here [v. 4]: "Every man shall dwell under 
his vine and fig tree," that is, every man shall enjoy in his 
station and office the various and exceeding good fruits 
of faith. 

Fifth, he teaches that this kingdom will have its 
enemies in the world, since each individual nation will 
walk in the name of its God, but the church will walk in 
the name of our God. But he promises that this kingdom 
will not be oppressed, but it will be an eternal kingdom. 
For "we" he says (v. 5), "will walk in the name of the Lord 
our God forever and ever. 

To this comfort also belongs what he says [v. 6. f.) 
about the lame and the outcast. For although we have 
explained this in the interpretation of the remnant of the 
kingdom of Israel among the Gentiles, there is nothing 
to prevent us from applying it to the whole church. 


1172 L. XXVI, 464-466. the main teachings from Micah. W. VI, 3035-3039. 


which is despised and afflicted in the world, as 
Zephaniah does in the third chapter, v. 19, who calls the 
church by this very name. 

But because before this promise of the kingdom of 
Christ was fulfilled, the people were to be led away 
captive to Babylon, the prophet comforts the godly so 
that they will not forget this king. And at the same time 
he adds this comfort [v. 13], that it will happen that they 
will not only be delivered from the Babylonian captivity, 
but will also rule over the Gentiles through the gospel, 
who will accept the word. 

The fifth chapter. 


This is a promise of Christ and his kingdom. In the 
beginning [v. 1.] it shows the place where Christ should 
be born. 

Secondly, he teaches of the person of Christ that he 
did not begin to be only when he was born of Mary, but 
was from eternity, that is, the Son of God. 

Third, he teaches of the ministry [v. 3 f.] that he will 
feed his people and they will dwell safely. For through 
Christ the kingdom of the devil and of sin is destroyed, 
and this victory of Christ is brought to the believers by 
the gospel. 

Fourth, he teaches that this kingdom also belongs to 
the Gentiles. He gloriously praises the ministry of the 
word, comparing the ministers of the gospel to dew and 
rain, threatening those who oppose the gospel with 
destruction, as he also says that the synagogue should 
be destroyed. 

The sixth chapter. 


This is a sermon of the Law, in which he accuses the 
people of supreme ingratitude, and condemns the 
ungodly services with which they hoped to propitiate 
GOD. 

But what is exceedingly beautiful, he shows [v. 8.] in 
what services God is pleased, namely obedience to the 
word, mercy to the poor and patience and hope in 
adversity. 





1173 


Seeing that these services were being neglected by 
his people, and that avarice and other vices were 
increasing with idolatry, he threatened them with utter 
desolation. 

Here are excellent pictures with which he depicts 
avarice, which Chrysostom seems to have imitated to 
some extent in the fifth chapter of the first letter to the 
Corinthians, where he says: 


modhayic ta eiceveydévta yayos ohiya, ta ya- AOC yEipeva 
éCéEBaE 110/1,24 dvta, ovdév yap cadpotepov miEovecias, yav THY 
yéiv Enidne tip tolobtw tapusio, yav ddpav xav poydodb, Ei yat 
mavta noiic, mieovetiav évdov tov yasena@- tatov Anotnyv 
dnoyeioac, yai navta dvvéuevov ééevéyyerv. This we have 
translated simply but little daintily thus: often a small gain 
brought about by fraud has destroyed great goods 
legally acquired. For there is nothing that more easily 
corrupts all things than deceit. Even though you have 
guarded your box with a lock, a door and a bolt, you do 
it in vain, since you have locked fraud inside, the most 
violent robber, who takes away everything he finds. 

A similar saying is also in Isocrates, for he instructs 
the pagans by their own experience that evil gained 
good corrupts evil. 


The seventh chapter. 


This sermon is, as it were, a conclusion of the 
previous sermons. In the beginning it contains the 
complaint that he teaches the impenitent in vain. 

After that, he admonishes the godly not to let 
themselves be diverted from the right path by these 
aversions. For even though they should suffer the 
common punishments, he exhorts them to look to the 
kingdom of grace that will be established through Christ, 
which he gloriously praises as being a kingdom of 
forgiveness of sins, grace and eternal life. The rest is 
very abundantly explained in the interpretation.

who are supposed to promote the gospel, also persecute 
it to the utmost and confirm the ungodly nature against 
God's word 2c. And therefore, without a doubt, the same 
thing that happened to the despisers, the Jews, will also 
happen to our despisers. 

But the prophet Micah, in his prophecy, has completely 
the same thing in mind as Hosea. They saw that in vain 
so many prophets were sent, in vain the word was 
proclaimed so abundantly; they saw that the prophets 
were despised, yes, killed, and therefore they preached 
that both kingdoms should be disturbed, which 
nevertheless had a clear promise of God, namely that 
the kingdom of David would be eternal 1) that a duke 
should not be taken away from the seat of David until the 
Messiah came. For this the promise clearly says. This 
was certainly in appearance against the prophets, who 
threatened and foretold that both kingdoms should be 
disturbed, and also the godless Jews harassed the 
prophets with these prophecies of the kingdom of Judah. 
(Our people do not have such a clear word with which 
they, like the Jews, could oppose the Gospel). And yet 
God miraculously kept His promise. As miserable as He 
destroyed both kingdoms, He was not unmindful of His 
promise, for the kingdom did not completely fall away, 
because King Jechaniah, who was taken away to 
Babylon [2 Kings 24:15] and thrown into prison, was 
nevertheless preserved and finally set in honor and 
exalted above all the kings who were at Babylon, 3) as 
the sacred histories report [2 Kings 25:27]. But the flesh 
does not pay attention to this, so that God fulfills what he 
promised, even if only in one man. This is his way. Paul

His people: "Has God rejected His people? That is

far away! For | am also an Israelite, of the seed of 
Abraham" 2c. For a good part of the innumerable people 
was preserved. So also Isaiah says [Cap. 10, 22.], "For 
though thy people, O Israel, be as the sand of the sea, 
yet shall the remnant of them be converted." But the 
Jews understood the promises differently, therefore they 
did not want to suffer the prophecy of Hosea, Micah and 
others, who prophesied that both kingdoms should be 
disturbed. Our people today do not have such a word, 
even though they boast that they are the Church that 
God will not abandon. But they may look at the example 
of the Jews, be frightened, and stop being so confident. 
God can preserve His Church everywhere in the whole 
world, one and the other, soon in this city and soon in 
that city, while in the meantime all princes perish, the 
pope and all bishops, just as He miraculously preserved 
the Kingdom of Judah, since almost the entire kingdom 
had been destroyed. Thus God acts miraculously, so that 
the wicked are disgraced and blinded and perish. And 
sometimes he acts in such a way that the prophets seem 
to contradict each other completely, which is especially 
evident in Jeremiah and Ezekiel, where Jeremiah 
prophesies about Zedekiah, the king of Judah, that it will 
happen that he will be captured and delivered into the 
hands of the king of the Chaldeans, where he adds [Jer. 
32, 4. f.]: "He will speak to him verbally and shall see him 
with his eyes, and he will lead 4) Zedekiah to Babylon" 
2c. Ezekiel prophesies of the very same king thus (Cap. 
12, 12. f.]: "His face shall be covered, and he shall not 
see the land with his eyes; and | will bring him to Babylon, 
into the land of the Chaldeans, which he shall not see" 
2c. Thus he prophesies (apparently against Jeremiah). 
Ezekiel had predicted that the king would not see the 
land, and rightly so, for his eyes were plucked out before 
he was taken away to Babylon. And Jeremiah had 
predicted that he would see the eyes of the Babylonian 
king, and quite rightly too, for he is

had been led to the king before his eyes were plucked 
out 2c. And by this contradiction, as it seemed from the 
outward appearance, the godless Jews were annoyed, 
so that they completely 


accused of nonsense, since they contradict themselves. 
But God has this way, when He wants to make us fair; 
and so He acts against the presumptuous, who are too 
sure 2c. 


[The first chapter] 


V. 1. [This is the word of the LORD, which came to 
Micah from Mareshah, in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, 
Jehizkiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning 
Samaria and Jerusalem]. 


"In the days of the kings of Judah." He does not 
remember the kings of Israel, although he predicts the 
destruction of both. Amos and Hosea include both, the 
kings of Judah and Israel, but because Micah 
prophesied only in the kingdom of Judah, he remembers 
for this reason only the kings of Judah. "Maresa" is a city 
in the kingdom of Judah, as is clear from Joshua [Cap. 
15, 44], therefore he is called “of Maresa" 


(Morasthites). Incidentally, Micah was in the office of 
the Word for a long time, which can be inferred from the 
time when the kings under whom he prophesied reigned. 
Therefore he did not proclaim his prophecy in one 
sermon, also not in one year, but in always different 
sermons and in different years he said other things. As 
we have divided the prophet Amos into many sermons 
above, so we must do the same with Micah, just as 
Lucas [Cap. 3, 4.] calls the prophecy of Isaiah a "book of 
the speeches of Jefaiah"-"About Samaria and 
Jerusalem." This is certainly a great boldness that the 
prophet mentions Jernsalem immediately in the 
beginning of his prophecy. For in this way he 
immediately touched, as it were, the apple of the Jews' 
eyes, and it is to be wondered at that the prophet was 
not immediately killed. But he did not have evil kings and 
prophesied even under the godly Hezekiah; otherwise 
this prophesy seemed to be completely contrary to the 
promise of the kingdom of Judah, as we have said 
above. And the elders of the people who wanted to save 
the prophet Jeremiah from unjust death, 





used this example against the angry priests who wanted 
Jeremiah dead, as Jeremiah Cap. 26, 18: "In the days of 
Hezekiah king of Judah there was a prophet, Micah of 
Mareshah, who spoke to all the people of Judah" 2c. 


V. 2. Hear, all peoples, take heed, land and all that 
is within. 

With great spirit and with great vehemence he speaks 
in the beginning of the prophecy. He has imagined the 
future devastation with such certainty that he does not 
see how it can be resisted. He would like the people to 
be advised, since he sees that the lamentable 
destruction is already present. And his speech is even 
more vehement in what he adds: 


For GOD the LORD has to speak with you, even the 
LORD from His holy temple. 


That is, what | speak is certainly from the Lord. When 
you hear me speak to you, believe completely that the 
Lord is speaking to you. Hear, hear, take note of me, all 
of you, come together, and do not doubt that you hear 
the Lord when you hear me. Therefore believe me. So | 
simply understand what he says [Vulg.], "The Lord be 
unto you for a witness." That is, receive my preaching no 
differently than if GOD Himself spoke to you. "The LORD 
out of his holy temple," as if to say, Of this witness and 
this LORD | say, who is in the temple at Jerusalem. With 
this preface he rejects and completely puts down 
everything that is their worship, of which they boasted, 
namely the temple, the sacrifices, in short, everything of 
which they thought that it only pleased God. 


1180 D. xxvi, 156-158. interpretation of Micah (2.), Cap. 


1, 3-5. 1181 





V. 3. For behold, the LORD will go out of his place. 


Now he presents what he is going to teach, as if 
to say: Have no pleasure in yourselves, you are 
deceiving yourselves, since you are falsely imagining 
that you have a gracious God; do not be sure, for He 
certainly does not like the sure and presumptuous. 
"He will go out,” of whom you think he is hidden and 
silent, but he will soon come. 


And drive down. 


That is, he will prove himself present through his 
action, namely through the king of the Assyrians and 
Babylonia 


And step on the heights in the country. . 
The Hebrew word, which the Latin interpreter has 


translated here by excelsa ["heights"], is used to be 
taken for the altars, but it also means in general 
everything that is high or outstanding, because | 
believe that also for this reason the Latins have 
called the altars full of height and prominence. 
Therefore the opinion is: "The Lord will tread on the 
high places in the land", that is, on that which is high 
in the land, and on that which stands out above 
others, that is, the princes, the kings, the priests, the 
temple, the sanctuary, on all of which you rely, that it 
will stand firm on it, the Lord will tread and make it 
completely nothing. And this is the purpose of this 
whole prophecy, the main part or the summa or the 
goal, because all the following refers to it. 


v. 4. that the mountains will melt under him and the 
valleys will crack. 


It is a synecdoche: that which is contained therein 
for that which is contained therein. With these two 
words "mountains" and "valleys" he understands, in 
my opinion, the whole people, as if he wanted to say: 
Everything will be dissolved, everything will be 
destroyed, both what is on the mountains and what 
is in the valleys; no cities will be safe, may they be 
located in the heights or in the valleys. Thus he 
alludes to the nature or location of the land, for it is 
mountainous 2c. 


Like wax melts before the fire, like the waters that 
flow below. 


He still stops at the devastation, as if he wanted to 
say: The Lord will disturb you very easily, without any 
effort. For just as wax cannot but melt at the heat of 
the fire, and just as a body of water that threatens a 
precipitous course cannot be prevented from flowing 
down from the heights, so also this total disturbance 
of yours is in such a great impetuosity and precipitous 
course, so it threatens you, that just as wax cannot 
withstand the heat of the fire, that it should not 
become liquid 2c., so also you cannot remedy this 
evil in any way. So great is God's wrath when He is 
angry against the ungodly despisers of His word. 


V. 5: All this because of Jacob's transgression. 


The prophet taught this with a certain great joy of 
faith and with your great boldness, because he dared 
to accuse people of godlessness, who were 
apparently very holy, who were very careful about the 
works of the law, so that they would not transgress 
any part of it, who thought they were perfectly holy. If 
you compare with them our saints of works monks 
and all that there is of people of this kind, they are 
nothing. For those went about with works that God 
had commanded, and that with the greatest care and 
zeal; ours have to do with foolish and ridiculous 
works that they themselves have invented. But it 


should [instead of: in scelere Jacob omne istud in the 
Vulgate] have been translated more correctly thus: 
"All this because of Jacob's transgression,” as also 
Hof. 12, 13. should have been translated, "Israel had 


to serve for (propter) a wife," where our books read, 
in uxorem. But with this sermon, the prophets 
aroused the anger and bitterness of all against 
themselves, because the works saints, the Jews, 
could not suffer anything less than that their 
righteousness should be condemned, just as ours do 
not want to suffer it, even though they are already 
convicted by God's word. 


1182 L. xxvi, 158-iso. Interpretations on the prophets. 


1183 





But what is the transgression of Jacob? 2c." 


Here the prophet himself indicates that the 
godless works saints have stubbornly held on to 
theirs. Therefore, in imitative speech in the person of 
the people, he himself makes the objection: "But 
which is the transgression of Jacob?" [To which the 
prophet answers:] 1) "Is it not Samaria?" 


But what are the high places of Judah? Is it not 
Jerusalem? 


Here the word "high places" means. altars. 
Therefore the opinion is: | will discover to you the sins 
of both, Israel and Judah. Israel sins in Samaria, 
Judah in Jerusalem. This is the main piece of all 
ungodliness, namely worship and sacrifice neither 
instituted by GOD nor commanded by GOD's Word. 
And here we see again, as in all of Scripture, how it 
is not pleasing to God, even how he hates it, when we 
do something without his word, no matter how 
seemingly holy it may be in appearance; such were 
the services and sacrifices of the Jews, which they 
did to the true God; so that our people may finally be 
ashamed and renounce their error, since they know 
that God does not like any of the things that they 
themselves have done. 


V. 6. And | will make Samaria a heap of stones in the 
field, which are put round vineyards. 


He answers their objections with which they 
protected their ungodliness against God's word. The 
same word that we read here, "heap of stones", is 
also in the Psalm [Ps. 79, 1.]: "They have made of 
Jerusalem heaps of stones", that is, a kind of fence of 
stones around the vineyards, in which the stones are 
not smeared with mortar and inserted. 


And wants to drag their stones into the valley. 


That is, in heaps and with impetuosity | will roll 
them into the valley and overthrow them, so that 
neither tower nor wall shall remain. 





And to break ground. 


That is, | will mow them down in such a way that 
not one stone will be left upon another, so that the 
foundations will be visible to each one. 


V. 7. All their idols shall be broken, and all their 
whoredoms shall be burned with fire. 


That is, the things of which you even alone boast, 
as the idols, the calves, and the rest of the images, 
shall be utterly broken by the king of Assyria. - 
"Reward," that is, the consecration gifts, the interest, 
the gifts given to the priests, or to the temples, to set 
up worship, as in Hosea above [Cap. 2, 5. 12.]. 


For they are gathered of whoredom, and shall be 
whoredom again. 


This is a proverbial ned image. The whole people 
he calls a harlot. Therefore the meaning is: You have 
brought together by your whoredom these images, 
works of art and wages or votive gifts: they are 
whores' wages; that is, everything is acquired by 
ungodliness. Therefore | will again deliver it up to the 
ungodly king, who also delighteth in idolatry: and as 
it is acquired, so shall it perish. This is quite the same 


idiom that the Latins have: Male parta male 


dilabuntur [evil gained, evil torn]. Thus, out of God's 
judgment, the goods and treasures of the 
monasteries will undoubtedly also become the 
plunder and booty of some godless warriors. For they 
came no less from whores' wages than the wages of 
the Jews, as he calls it here. The word of God will not 
lie 2c. 


V. 8. | must lament and weep over this. 


The remaining part of this chapter is very difficult, 
because the difficulty of this passage is so great that 
the prophet has used Hebrew images and 
transferred idioms in almost every single word, so 
that | think that almost everything that the Hebrew 
language has in terms of images is brought together 
in this passage. Therefore, we are very nonsensical 
if we undertake to interpret the prophets without 
experience and a very thorough knowledge of the 
Hebrew language.

1185 





the Hebrew language. But | will do as much as | can 
with God's help to interpret this. | cannot promise 
anything else, nor should |. 

So far he has prophesied the disturbance of the 
kingdom of Israel and Judah: that all idols and votive 
gifts should be destroyed by the king of Assyria, who 
should come out of God's judgment as a destroyer 
against them. This he has completely set before his 
eyes as if the disturbance had already happened, 
and he behaves as if he were a spectator of the 
disturbance, and he begins with the greatest emotion 
of heart, as it were, with their present ruin: "At this | 
must lament. "2c. Everything must be read and 
understood in the mode of possibility if we are to 
translate it into Latin. For the Hebrews have no 
optative, therefore they cannot speak thus according 
to our manner. But a Latin would say like this: 
Someone could or should mourn and lament. 


| must go deprived and bare. 


This "to be naked" must be referred to more 
exquisite adornment, namely: | will put on a bad and 
lowly garment and take off all other, more 
respectable garments, in order to indicate thereby 
the wretchedness of the desolation. Thus, at the 
command of the Lord, Isaiah also went naked. By this 
nakedness he indicated, as the text in Isaiah [Cap. 
20, 2. ff.] says, the captivity of Egypt. It does not take 
place, however, that we would like to think that Isaiah 
went along completely naked in the whole body, but 
he was only dressed with a small and very short 
garment, while he had taken off the long and more 
respectable garment. This is also how the passage 
in the Gospel history [Marc. 14, 52] about the disciple 
who let go of the linen and just escaped is to be 
understood. 


| must wail like the dragons. 


The Hebrew word means both a whale and a 
dragon. | do not know what the lamentation of the 
dragons is like. By the way, the prophet mentions 
large animals, which, because of the size of their 
bodies, emit a great roar, and by this he makes the 
future sorrow great 2c. 


And mourn like ostriches. 


Like the young ostriches (filiae struthionum). The 
kind of the ostrich is described Job 39, 14. ff. It leaves 
the eggs it has laid on the ground, but it does not care 
for its young at all. Therefore, he calls young 
ostriches those who are completely abandoned and 
missed by their mothers. 


V. 9. 1) For their plague is no counsel. 

That is, it is quite a miserable and hopeless 
plague. For this is what the Hebrew word means: "A 
wretched, poor, sorrowful being." 


Which shall come into Judah, and shall reach unto 
the gates of my people unto Jerusalem. 

| think the prophet is not talking about the 
Babylonian 2) captivity, but about the fear that arose 
from the captivity of the neighbor, just as if the Turk 
devastated a city very close to us, this neighborhood 
would frighten us all, so that we would fear that the 
Turk would also come to us 2c. So | think, in this 
passage, the opinion is as if to say: the plague of the 
kingdom of Israel is lamentable and tremendous. The 
damage will not be healed, and this plague frightens 
and makes Judah fearful, so that it thinks it will also 
be destroyed and disturbed. 


V. 10. Do not proclaim it to Gath, do not let 
yourselves be heard crying. 


The word lachrimis [with tears], which is added in 
the Latin translation, could have been omitted. This 
passage is taken from the Song of David 2 Sam. 1, 
20, as the prophets are used to take much from the 
histories. For the same words are here as there: 
"Announce it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the street 
of Asklon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, 
lest the daughters of the uncircumcised be glad.” For 
it was a great calamity to Israel that King Saul was 
slain. When the enemies of Israel heard this-

1186 L. XXVI, 163-165. interpretations on the prophets. 





they would have wished him luck for their king's 
downfall 2c. So here Micah imitates the same, as if to 
say: Conceal it in every possible way, so that your 
enemies do not rejoice over the misfortune you have 
suffered. For there was not only the disturbance, but 
also a very special fear of disgrace, that the enemies 
would mock them, that they would impose upon them 
God, whom they had always praised as their 
protector and leader. 


But go into the mourning chamber (in domo 
pulveris). 

The Hebrew word actually denotes excavated 
earth, earth that is not clumped together but tends to 
be like that which is thrown out of graves. In other 
places it is translated by the word earth. It is a 


Hebrew way of saying: in domo pulveris “in the 
house of dust], as if to say: in the house of sprinkling 
with dust, where dust tends to be sprinkled. Therefore 
the opinion is: Do not mourn publicly; it is proper that 
you hide yourselves in some corner, where mourners 
are wont to hang on to their grief. Hide yourselves in 
corners, so that your enemies, when they hear of 
your exceedingly miserable misfortune, will not laugh 
at you and mock you. 


And sits in the ashes. 

The Hebrew says: There cover thee with dust, 
namely, that the enemies may not know thy 
desolation. Thus, in all these things, he holds up the 
future thing as a present thing, that he may move 
them to repentance by the expressed wretchedness 
of the future desolation. 


V. 11. You beautiful city must go with all the shame; 
the inhabitant of Zaenan will not go out for the sake of 
the suffering of the next house; he will take it from you 
when he camps there. 


There is an extraordinary difficulty in this passage. 
According to the Hebrew | read thus: transi tibi, 
habitatio pulchra, discooperta ignominia, non 
egreditur habitatio Zaenan vel Zenan. Planctum 


domus vicina de vobis accipiet, dum stat ipsa. 
Jerome has this 





1187 
In his translation of the Bible he always translates the 
proper names by generic names, but in his 


interpretations he translates the generic names by 
proper names. Thus in this passage, where he 


translates ["the inhabitant of Zaeuan"]: quae habitat 
in exitu, where by all means it had to be translated by 
a proper name. It is a Hebrew peculiarity in the word 


habitatio. For the Hebrew word denotes a citizen, 
and we, if we were free to form a word, would actually 


render it by Cividitas. But the prophet says with a 


bitter and harsh concession: Go away (transi), as if 
to say: Go away, thou beautiful city, thou glorious 
kingdom of Samaria, go away, "go away, thou tender 
city," for thee there is no salvation, it is done for thee. 
There is no one to stop the LORD; the LORD's wrath 
runs against you like a sudden flood, as he said 
above. For this your shame has been revealed, that 
is, ithas been made public that you are passing away 
and are being disturbed; it is not hidden from anyone. 


confusa 


ignominia, is an inconsistent reading. - "She will not 
go out," this seems to me to say the prophet 
imitatively. "Zenan" is a city in the tribe of Judah, 
which is clear from the 15th chapter of the book of 
Joshua [v. 37.]. The prophet added a letter. This city 
with the others mentioned here were the closest to 
the prophet when he proclaimed this prophecy. For 
he prophesied in the kingdom of Judah, as we said 
above. Therefore, he addresses the nearest and 
neighboring cities to him. Therefore, this passage has 
a twofold opinion: first, go forth, kingdom of Israel, "go 
forth"; our city where we dwell does not yet go forth 
with you, it is safe 2c. Second. The other opinion 
pleases me better; as if the prophet wanted to say: 
My people at Zaenan siud still safe and say: To us 
the Assyrian will not come, to us this evil will not 
approach, we will be safe. So here everything is 
spoken quite figuratively, as if he wanted to say, "Oh 
no, Zenan will not go." This seems to be only the most 
appropriate interpretation. Whoever does not like this 
may teach better than | do. But, as | have said, a 
proper name must certainly be read here. 


For what we read [in the Vulgate]: 


1188 L. XXVI, 16S-167. Interpretation of Micah (2.), Cap. 1, 11-14. 


"For the sake of the suffering of the next house" 2c. 1) 
That is, you are already going, and the Assyrian is 
leading you away captive; therefore the neighboring 
Hans, that is, the kingdom of Judah, will receive suffering 
from you, which has stood by itself, that is, is still 
standing unharmed. Therefore, even though it still 
exists, it is suffering because of the fear of the captivity 
of its neighbor, as | said above. 


V. 12. The afflicted city is not able to comfort itself. 
2) 

He gives the reason of the suffering. First, he says 
that she has become weak in good, so that the opinion 
would be: she is weak for good, she does not exert 
herself for good, the dwelling of bitterness, that is, of 
disobedience. And so we relate it to the guilt, as if he 
wanted to say: that she will be frightened, and that she 
will complain, she has earned that with her bitterness. 
The other opinion is: she stands indeed, she is 
unharmed, but she bears sorrow, mourns, and is grieved 
for your sake, since she also fears misfortune for herself. 
And this opinion refers to the punishment, and | like it 
better. 


For calamity will come from the Lord, even to the 
gate of Jerusalem. 
That is, it has also come close to them. 


Vv. 13. You city of Lachish, harness runners and 
drive away. 


As everything in this passage at the end of this 
chapter is very difficult, this passage is also equal to the 
others. | translate after the Hebrew thus: Bind (or 
harness) the chariot to drive, you inhabitant of Lachi. 
What Lyra teaches about the city is nothing, since this 
city is sufficiently known, which in 


1) This reads in the Vulgate: ktanetum aoruus vieirm aeeipiet ex 
vodis, Huue stetit sibimet “the neighboring house will receive 
suffering from you, which is still unharmed4 This is what the 
interpretation refers to. 

2) Our text offers: Huia inirrnuta est in kono UaUitatio 
nmnrituctinurn [for grown weak in good is the dwelling of bitterness’; 
whereas the Vulgate: Huiu inUrmata 68t in donuin, Hnas Uabitat in 
nmaritnainidns. 





1189 


was in the midst of Judah, near the Philistines, very near 
the others mentioned here. And since the prophet 
prophesied in the midst of these cities, he fits the 
prophecy to them, as we have said. But the prophet 
speaks with a bitter concession, as above, and it is the 
opinion: Harness wagons, prepare yourself, Lachish, 
you must also go away, the captivity is also close to you. 


For you are the beginning of sin to the daughter of 
Zion, and in you are found the transgressions of Israel. 


These histories are unknown to us, for they are 
nowhere else contained in Scripture; therefore the 
prophet must be believed that this city was the occasion 
and originator of the kingdom of Judah, that it followed 
the ungodlinesses of the kingdom of Israel. It is therefore 
the summa of the passage: Because you, Lachish, have 
been the comrade of Israel in sin, and have given Judah 
the first occasion to follow the ungodliness of Israel, you 
will also be the comrade in punishment, and the first in 
captivity. This also happened, because this city was first 
conquered in the kingdom of Judah. Therefore, when the 
prophet says, "In you are found," he does not mean that 
this city was the first to commit these wickednesses, but 
that it was also the first to follow these wickednesses, 
led by the example of Israel, before all the other cities of 
Judah 2c. 


V. 14: You will have to give prisoners, as well as 
Gath. 3) 


The Hebrew word "Siloah" is Joh. 9, 7. where John 
adds: "that is interpreted, sent". a sending; to the 
Hebrews it means both a gift and a messenger. | 
interpret it here by messengers, so that the opinion is: 
Well, send gifts, look for auxiliaries, by whom 
surrounded, you will think to be safe. Oh how badly you 
will succeed 4) the thing, in vain you try everything 2c.

1191 





The city of Achsib will lack the kings of Israel. 1) 


Here the Latin interpreter translated very badly 
and unrhymed by generic names, while it should 
have been translated by a proper name, as also 
above. For this ["Achsib"] is also a city in the kingdom 
of Judah, as can be seen from Jos. 15, 44. The 
interpreter translates: House 2) of lies. So great was 
the blindness of the interpreter. Therefore the opinion 
is: You, Lachish, and you, Israel, you agree in your 
godlessness; well, go on, gather the Philistines, send 


to the city of Achsib (domos XXXX) because of a 
covenant, but so the kings of Israel will deceive 
themselves. That is, the kings of Israel will ally 
themselves with the Philistines, and will rely on this 
confidence, but the very thing in which they trust will 
cause them to be deceived. 


V. 15. | will bring you, Maresa, the right heir. 


This can be understood either ironically or simply. 
Ironic in this way: | will bring you an inheritance of 
which you are worthy, namely the king of Assyria. 
You are equal in evil, therefore | will make the 
inheritance equal. Here is such a play on words, 
which one cannot transfer into the Latin language 
with the best will in the world. Among the Hebrews, 
"Maresa" means [sriV] an inheritance; to this name 
he alludes when

he wanted to say: "Harre, harre", Erbtheil (hereditas), 


"| will send you an heir (heredem)". The simple 
interpretation of this passage is this, which | also like 
more: You, Maresa, are still standing there 
unharmed, you are safe. The enemy, the devastator, 
has not yet come to you; an heir is sent to you, 
namely I, so that | may preach repentance to you 
through my prophecy, so that you, if you believe my 
preaching, will be preserved and escape captivity. 
And this my prophecy is "the glory of Israel, which 
shall come unto Adullam". So we have finished this 
extraordinarily complicated and difficult passage, 
and accomplished what we could with God's help. 
What follows now is an explanation of what has gone 
before. 


V. 16. Let the hair be shorn off and go bald. 
. Baldness was a sign of mourning among this 
people, as we said above about the other prophets. 


About your tender children. 


That is, about your descendants, in whom you 
have delighted, in whom you have had great joy. 


Make yourself as bald as an eagle. 

That is, bear heavy sorrow and mourn, there is a 
great and lamentable captivity ahead of you. 3) Give 
yourself a complete makeover, as an eagle is wont 
to cast off its old feathers and grow new ones, and 
thus become young again, as it says in the Psalm 
[Ps. 103:5]. 


3) Weimarsche: de instead of: te. 


The second chapter. 


In the previous chapter one sermon is completed, in 
this chapter he starts a new sermon. For he preached 
this sermon on different days or at different times, not all 
at once, as | reminded in the beginning. In the previous 
chapter he announced to them that their captivity would 
come upon them. 


Because of their holiness, that is, because of their 
idolatrous worship, which they themselves had 
wrought according to their own will against the 
revealed word of God. Here he announces the same 
captivity because of the fruits of ungodliness. For as 
faith cannot but bring forth good fruits 


1192 L. XXVI, 168-170. interpretation of Micah (2.), Cap. 2, 1. 2. 


1193 





ungodliness cannot but bring evil fruit, namely 
avarice, violence, unrighteous judgment 2c., all of 
which the prophet lists here, and the apostle Paul in 
the letter to the Galatians Cap. 5, 19. ff. Therefore, 
as in the first chapter he punished hypocrisy and the 
made-up godlessness, so in this chapter the gross 
and obvious sins, which lack all semblance of 
holiness, which must necessarily follow where the 
heart is godless. 


V. 1. Woe to those who seek to do harm. 
The Hebrew word XXX is sufficiently known, 


because it actually means "toil" (dolorem), which is 
evident from the 90th Psalm, v. 10: "When it comes 
up, itis eighty years, and when it has been delicious, 
it has been toil and labor." Therefore [figuratively] in 
the prophets any iniquity is denoted by this word 
[because from iniquity comes toil and labor] 1). 
Therefore also in this passage there is a figurative 
speech, as if he wanted to say: s "to do harm",] with 
this you perish on your camp. Since he says: "All your 
camp", he indicates their striving and endeavoring, 
so that the opinion is: you deal with it by day and by 
night alone, that is your thinking and striving, you are 
only concerned about how you might do harm and 
act violently against the poor. The same way of 
speaking is Ps. 36, 5: "He seeks to harm his camp," 
that is, he deals with it, he spends his effort on it 2c. 
Therefore, the prophet recently says this: You never 
presume to do evil; it never occurs to me that you are 
in any way concerned about justice. 


That they accomplish it early, when it becomes 
light. 

He indicates a certain time, and in my opinion the 
prophet is speaking of the evil they commit in 
judgment and doctrine, that is, that they bend justice 
with oppression of the poor, that they do not dispense 
equal justice, and that instead of the word-. 


1) Supplemented by us according to the Zwickau manuscript. 





tes teach ungodly things. It is therefore the opinion: 
You deal only with the oppression of the poor, and for 
this purpose you give laws and change them again, 
you do not speak equal law. Early you teach the 
people, you also hold court, but at night you are intent 
on something completely different, namely, that you 
use the word of God for your own gain, and by unjust 
judgments you seek to do nothing but owe the poor 
that their fields and possessions become a bequest 
to you. These are the fruits of wickedness. For how 
should an evil tree bring forth other than evil fruit? 
Such a picture appears to us in a very special way in 
the realm of the pope, where nothing else is treated, 
nothing is taken care of, but that those who are in it 
live deliciously. All papist laws and decrees are 
intended to ensure that his so-called clergy do not 
suffer any lack, that they have an abundance of all 
things, and so that they do not lose anything, they 
banish the poor debtors and throw them tenfold into 
hell. 2c. 


Because they have the power. 2) 

The prophet interprets himself as if he wanted to 
say: Everything they do, everything they teach is 
against God, no matter how much they pretend. In 
the same way, our papists, by pretending to the name 
of the Lord and the holy apostles Peter and Paul and 
the holy church, have seized almost all goods; finally, 
they have received almost everything that there is in 
the way of money, and they have devoured widows' 
houses, as Christ says [Matth. 23, 14]. 


V. 2: They do violence to every man's house 
(Calumniati sunt virum et domum ejus). 

The Hebrews use their word which we render in 
Latin by vir, as we speak in German when we 
impersonally express ourselves: "One says thus. The 
prophets refer to this practice of the wicked 
everywhere, as we have seen above. 


2) Vulgate: HuornaiQ contra vsum 68t inanus ooruiu, because their 
hand is against God. This is what the interpretation refers to. 


1194 n. xxvi, 170-172. interpretations on the prophets.

v. 3. Behold, | remember evil against this 
generation. 

The Lord opposes his thoughts to their ungodly 
thoughts, as if to say: You think evil against others, | 
think evil against you. 


From which you should not draw your neck, and not 
walk so proudly, for it shall be an evil time. 

| will see to it that your pride is subdued, that you 
do not walk proudly with your necks erect and do 
violence to others, for it is to be an evil time. The 
Assyrian will come, who will tame you, who are now 
arrogant and proud 2c. 


V. 4. At the same time you will be judged and 
lamented. 


[Instead of et cantabitur canticum cum suavitate, 
dicentium in the Vulgate should read:] et plangetur 


planctus or lamentabitur lamentatio, that is, the time 
will come when | will create that you will become the 
proverb of all; you will become a song to your 
victorious enemies. But he presents the goal 


(SCOpum) or the summa of this song, as if he wanted 
to say: This is how they will sing about you: 

It's over, we are lost. My people's land (par8) gets a 
foreign master. 

[The words in the Vulgate: Depopulatione vastati 
sumus, pars populi mei commutata est mean:] 
vastatione vastati sumus, ager populi mei 
commutatus est.... We have also spoken of this word 
sparst above in Amos [Cap. 4, 7.]. It actually means 
a portion of inheritance or a portionem or acre, which 
is allotted to each one. 


When will he restore the fields he has taken from 
us? 1) 

This also belongs to the song. But this passage 
has a twofold opinion. First, that twice an invasion 
was made into the country: once by ThiglathPilesser, 
then also by his 2) son. This has my 


1) Vulgate: Huomo4o iseatist a ine, <uim revertatur, Huinoktras 
ulviuat¢ 
2) Weimarsche: "is instead of: esus. 


Approval does not. | translate thus: Quomodo 
extrahet quis mihi, ut rursus agri nostri 


distribuantur, and so | take the Hebrew verbum as 
an adverbium. For this is the custom among the 
Hebrews in such ways of speaking, which can be 
seen exceedingly clearly from the 71st Psalm [v. 20.]: 


et conversus vivificasti me; likewise [v. 21.]: et 


conversus consolatus es me, that is, "And comfort me 
again,” "and make me alive again," 2c. Hence the 
opinion is, All our possessions are gone; who 
therefore will 3) draw us out of this yoke, that our 
acres may be restored to us? But this will not happen, 
they have got another master and owner. And so this 
song, if itis sung by the enemies, is a [mocking] song, 
if by the defeated, a lament. This is my opinion about 
this passage, and | do not think that | am wrong in it, 
although | differ from others. 


V. 5: Yea, ye shall have no part in the congregation 
of the Lord. 

He definitely speaks of the total destruction, 
therefore not only a part of the people is to be 
understood, as the reading in Latin reads. As if he 
wanted to say: The whole nation will perish from the 
bottom up; there will be no one left who will measure 
the limits in the assembly or in the congregation of 
the Lord, that is, in the people where the word of God 
is. Thus the Lord has set the short epitome of his 
thoughts against their ungodly thoughts. 


V. 6 They say that we should not be put to the 
sword, for we will not be put to the sword, we will not 
be put to shame. 

At this point [in the Vulgate] everything is 
translated quite confusedly. But it is a new piece 
here; the song is now finished, or the short epitome 
is completed. | translate thus: ne stilletis stillam. For 
so it is actually in the Hebrew, and the prophets use 
the word "traufen" for preach; rain means sermon. 
Recently, then, it is this: He accuses the authorities 
who hindered the prophets from preaching. 


3) Weimarsche: eZo instead of erZo. 


1196 L. XXVI, 172-174. interpretation of Micah (2.), Cap. 2, 6-8. 





1197 





and not to prophesy the disturbance of the people |World 2c. But the prophets held that not all were 


whom God had chosen as His own; who therefore 
accused the prophets of lying and held against them 
the promises that God had made to the Israelite 
people, as we said at the beginning of this prophet. 


Because such eaves do not hit us, we will not be so 
disgraced. 


These are their words, they say to the prophets. 
But they can also be understood as a threat, in this 
way: We warn them that they should not dream, 
otherwise they will be ‘put to shame. Or in this way: 
They shall not dream such things, for we shall not be 
put to shame. The prophets lie, GOD will not so 
disgrace His people whom He has chosen and to 
whom He has promised that He will always stand by 
them 2c. Both views are good. 


V. 7. The house of Jacob comforts itself thus: Do 
you think that the spirit of the Lord is shortened? 1) 


This is a new saying, as if he wanted to say: This 
is the defiance of those who, encouraged by a wrong 
understanding of the promises, despise our threats. 
Either Isaiah followed Micah or Micah followed 
Isaiah, for both have this passage. By the way, in my 
opinion, Isaiah seems to have followed Micah. Isaiah 
has thus [Cap. 50, 2.], "Has my hand now become so 
short?" It is therefore the opinion of this passage: You 
prophets threaten us with calamity; you lie, GOD is 
with us, the LORD is our GOD, we are His people. 
He has promised that he will be our leader, that he 
will subdue our enemies; but you prophesy against 
us that the enemies will prevail against us, you are 
nonsensical, you speak against the promises of God. 
So also our papists boast against the gospel that God 
will stand by His Church until the end of the 


1) The keyword in our pattern is according to the Hebrew: “uu’uid 
dmturu est in douio daeok. The Vulgate offers: Oieitdorausdaeod:

manuscript: Vicitur in dorno dscok: Nurnyuid "te. The Hall manuscript 
also has the reading of our original. 


Israelites who were of Israel, and that the promises 
belonged not to the ungodly but to the godly. 


Should he want to do this? (Si tales sunt 
cogitationes ejus.) 

As if they wanted to say: "Yes, yes", the Lord does 
not have such a mind, he will reject us "rightly. 
According to the Hebrew way they speak like this. 
[Vulg.: Are then such his thoughts?] 


It is true, my speeches are kind to the pious. 


The prophet answers and in a few words resolves 
all their objections and refutes them, as if to say: | do 
not recognize the ungodly as mine, | do not want you 
if you are not pious. It is a very clear and distinct 
passage against our papists, who still do not believe 
the gospel and oppose it with a reason of proof taken 
from the crowd, that so many holy men in the church 
could not have erred for so many years 2c. The Lord 
says: "My sayings are indeed kind", | keep what | have 
promised, | stand by as | have promised, but only to 
the pious who trust me, believe my word. 


V. 8. 2) But my people have risen up like an enemy. 

That is, so much is lacking in it that it should be 
pious and good, that it is also my enemy. It stands up 
against me, opposes me. 


Because they rob both skirt and coat. 
They are robbers, they miserably flay the poor, 
therefore | will not spare them, | do not recognize 
them as mine 2c. 


To those who go along safely, just like those who 
come out of the war. 

That is, you sow strife. Where there is no strife, 
you seize the opportunity for strife. We have 
experienced this very well in the realm of Pabst. 


2) This verse number is missing in the Weimar one. The following 
is attached to v. 7 without distinction. 


1198 xxvi, N4-176. interpretations on the prophets. 


V. 9: You drive the wives of my people out of their 
dear homes. 

Some interpret this saying of the captivity, but it 
seems to me that it still soeaks of the robbing of the 
ungodly chief priests, as if to say, By harshly 
collecting the debts you have so afflicted the poor 
widows and old women that they have been forced to 
sell their houses; you have trampled them entirely 
into the dust. Likewise: 


You always take my jewelry from their young 
children. 

Our [Latin] interpreter has translated the Hebrew 
word unrhymed by the word laustem. For it means 
"actually an adornment or ornament. So it is in the 


110th Psalm, v. 3.: In splendoribus sancti, where the 
same word is, "In holy ornament." Therefore it is 
thought that so great has been your covetousness, so 
inflamed are you with the desire to gather riches, that 
you have taken away even the young children's 
ornaments; the goods with which the young children 
were to be adorned you have confiscated, their 
mothers you have driven away, and these things you 
have snatched. So you did not care about 
respectability and justice, and so you took away 
everything that the damage could never be repaired. 
And so | think itis a description of the violence against 
the women and the young children. 


V. 10. 1) Therefore get up, you must leave, you shall 
not stay here. 


Because you have driven out the poor women and 
the young children, this shall be your reward: | will 
drive you out again, and take away your ornaments 
from you, as you took away the ornaments of the 
young children.

means. That is, those of you who are now in beautiful

following section.

Appearances go along in prosperity and splendor, 
you who are quite extraordinarily pleasing to 
yourselves, before me you are quite unclean, 
therefore | will destroy you, and this destruction will 
be a cruel and terrible one, it will be over with you 2c. 


V. 11: If | were a spirit and a preacher of lies 
(Utinam essem vir ambulans vento). 


What we read in our [Latin] Bible: utinam non 
essem, is an error. But it is the same Hebrew idiom 
above in Hosea [Cap.9, 7.]: Vir Venti his man of the 


wind], that is, a void (ventosus). So also here: Would 
to God that | were a vain man, that I were vain, false, 
and lying, lest that should come to pass which | so 
fearfully threaten thee would come to pass. 


And preached how they should drink and eat. 


| would that | spoke lies, then | would be silent 
about the cross and vengeance and destruction 
coming upon you, as your false prophets do; | would 
also proclaim to you promises and good times. 


That would be a preacher for this people (Et erit 
stillans), 


That is, the LORD will send you a preacher whom 
you will hear. Because you do not hear me, the 
prophet sent by God, you will have to hear the king 
of Assyria 2c. 


V. 12: But | will gather you, Jacob, completely. 


Until now, the Lord has opposed his thoughts to 
the ungodly thoughts of the high priests and priests 
who had taken over the reign. Now he passes in a 
transition from the Israelite kingdom to the eternal 
and spiritual kingdom of Christ. For all the prophets 
have the way, which we have also seen above in 
those whom we have interpreted, that after they have 
sufficiently prophesied of the disturbance of the 
people and the outward kingdom, they pass over to 
the spiritual and eternal kingdom of Christ, of which 
they had foretold that it would be after the outward 
kingdom had passed away. It is very important to 


1200 b. 176-178. interpretation of Micah (2.), Cap. 2, 12. 13. 


1201 





note this with the prophets. For this passage can by 
no means be understood of the restoration of the 
entire outward people, as the words admittedly read. 
Therefore, the text itself will oblige us and certainly 
convince us that it must be understood of the spiritual 
kingdom. For it was quite certain that the kingdom of 
Israel should never be brought back and restored, 
nor is it read that it was ever restored, as the sacred 
histories show, and yet the prophet preaches, after 
the kingdom had been utterly destroyed and laid 
waste, that Jacob should be brought back. By this 
name, however, he certainly understands the whole 
people as a whole. Therefore, we are forced to admit 
that the prophet is speaking of a spiritual gathering 
that will come about through the proclamation of the 
gospel in the whole world, through which the 
scattered Israel will be gathered together 2c. "Jacob 
wholly"; these words read entirely as if he would 
gather the whole people, whereas they have not 
been wholly gathered. This is also how the promise 
of Christ reads: In you all nations shall be blessed, 
while not all nations are blessed. Therefore, it is very 
important to pay attention to this in the prophets, 
otherwise careless readers will stumble and cannot 
help but take offense at such passages. For it is quite 
another thing for all nations to be blessed than for all 
nations to accept or believe this promise of their 
blessing. For just as blessing is promised to all, so it 
is also offered to all through the gospel in Christ. God 
keeps what he has promised, but not all receive this 
blessing, not all believe him, therefore they do not 
obtain it. The same thing the Lord says in this 
passage, as if he wanted to say: | have spread my 
net over all Israelites by sending the gospel word of 
Christ, but not all obey this word, they do not want to 
be gathered into this sheepfold of Christ, therefore 
they are not gathered. That is why he speaks of the 
ministry of the word in this passage, as do all the 
prophets in similar passages, which is_ highly 
necessary for all prophets. 





And bring the rest of Israel in heaps. 
This is the same as what he already said about the 
gathering of Jacob through the ministry of the gospel. 


| will put them together like a herd in a stable, and 
like a flock in its hurdles. 

That is, | will gather them into One flock, into One 
sheepfold, and into the same pasture. "I will gather 
them finely into one flock, | will sound the gospel to 
them, and one spirit 2c. 


That it should sound of people. 

That is, so great will be the abundance and the 
multitude of those who believe the gospel that there 
will be a great noise and a great multitude and a very 
great crowd of those who will come. And here is a 
clear text of the conversion of the Gentiles. 


V. 13. a breaker shall go up before them, they shall 
break through, and go out to the gate, and their king 
shall go before them, and the LORD before them. 


This is too weak, what we have [in the Vulgate]: 


pandens iter [who breaks the way]. The Hebrew 
reads thus: before them shall arise a breaker, 
therefore they shall break through, and pass through 
the gate 2c. This passage is extraordinarily beautiful 
and exceedingly comforting. There is in it an 
indication of the cross, as if to say, | lead them to the 
pasture and to the sheepfold, as Christ says [John 
10:28.], "I give them eternal life." But this is very 
important, since it is not a path that has been trodden; 
many things stand in the way so that the elect cannot 
break through, namely the devil, sin, the law, death 
and the whole of the old Adam, but | will make it so 
that nothing can withstand you, | will promise them a 
breaker who will break through and remove every 
obstacle; he will prepare the way for them, and so the 
passage will be easy. By the way, as | have said, this 
passage is not pleasant to the flesh, because the 
whole flesh must be killed. The world, sin, the devil, 
and our entire Adam oppose me from breaking 
through. 


1202 xxvi, 178-I80. Interpretations on the prophets. 


1203 





that we should not follow this our breaker. But Christ 
says [John 16:33]: "Be of good cheer, | have 
overcome the world", | have broken through; and you 
too, since there is nothing more in the way, shall 
break through, that is, this gate which was 
bequeathed by sin, the world and the law, but you 
shall break through into eternal life. And so the Lord 
is our Head, that is, our 





Leader and Victor; as he has broken through, so shall 
we also break through 2c. And so under the leader 
and prince Christ Jacob is completely gathered. 
Although this text seems obscure, it is quite clear from 
it that Christ is God and man, that he died and rose 
again, that he ascended to the Father and reigns 
forever 2c. 


The third chapter. 


| consider that this chapter should be repeated 
(per dvayeyadaiwow - as a 
Recapitulation), and it is not preached immediately 
after the preceding, but long after. But everything in 
this chapter is easy, because he only punishes 
external vices, just as above. Everything concerns 


moral things (moralia), and it is nothing that could 
endure the reader. 


V. 1. [It should be you who would know the right]. 
Judicium, that is, the law. 


V. 2. You flay their skin and the flesh from their legs. 


This is a figurative and poetic way of speaking by 
which he punishes the violence of the leaders, as we 
have also seen in the previous chapter. The Germans 
use to speak in the same way about such godless 
oppressors of their subjects: "He flays them to the 
ridge. Thus, in this passage, he also used a violent 
figure of speech against the godless tyranny of 
godless princes. 


V. 3. [And when you have skinned them 2c.] 


"They skin them alive." He remains with the 
description of the violence, as if he wanted to say: 
They take with the highest violence all belongings of 
the whole people. 


V. 4. but will hide his face from you 2c. 

The prophets are used to follow Moses, as this is 
also taken from the Song of Moses [Deut. 32:20]. 
That God hides his face means that he is angry; that 
he shows his face means that he is merciful and 
favorable and wants us to be well, as in the 80th 
Psalm, v. 4: "Let your face shine, and we shall be 
healed. And everywhere in the Psalms is this way of 
speaking of the Scriptures. 


V. 5. 1) Thus says the Lord against the prophets. 

From this it is clear that this chapter is directed 
against the princes, prophets and priests of the 
people. The summary of this passage is: the 
prophets and the priests flatter the princes and thus 
deceive the people, they prevent the people from 
turning away from their godless nature, but rather 
they despise the word of the prophets sent by the 
Lord and strengthen the people in their godlessness. 
And this is what he says: 


id preach that it should go well where they are 
fed. 2 


That is, they oppose the good prophets who 
proclaim the word of the Lord correctly. 


1) The preceding verse numbers in this chapter are missing in the 
Weimar edition, but these verse numbers are only set in the following 
section. 

.2) Vulgate: Hui mortisut Usutidus suis, vt prastieaut xaesin, who bite 
with their teeth, and preach peace. From this the interpretation refers. 


1204 L- xxvi, 18V-182. Interpretation of Micah (2.), Cap. 3, 5-8. 1205 





They shout and persecute the prophets of the Lord 
and strengthen the people in their godlessness "by 


preaching that it should go well" (pacem). So it is also 
said in Jer. 6, 14: "Peace, peace! and yet is not 
peace" 2c. This is also taken from Moses. But the 
opinion is: they call the people safe, they say that the 
disturbance will not happen, they accuse the 
prophets of lying, threatening captivity, they say that 
God will not abandon His people, since He has 
promised to be with them. Such false prophets, who 
preach peace where there is no peace, are the 
monks and all those who preach that one should trust 
in works. 


But where they are not given anything in their 
mouths, they preach that war must come. 1) 


"The mouth" (os) is almost always referred in 
Scripture to the ministry of the Word, but the 
devouring and devouring is attached to the "jaws" 


(guttur), as in Psalm [Ps. 5:10.], "Their jaws are an 
open grave." Therefore this seems to me to be the 
opinion, although others are of a different opinion, as 
if he wanted to say: so great is their ungodliness and 
their bitterness against the prophets of the Lord, that 
they stir up and instigate war against him who does 
not agree with them in preaching, who does not 
approve of their ungodliness, and persecute and kill 
him. 


V. 6 Therefore your face shall become night, and 
your divination darkness. 


That is, your preaching of peace will cause you to 
be blinded, so that when calamity comes, because it 
would be most necessary for you to prophesy, you 
will see no visions, prophesy nothing. So great will be 
the misfortune: you will leave the people in the lurch, 
you will also find no remedy against the misfortune; 
you will perish with the people. This is how the 
godless preachers are finally disgraced by GOU 2c. 


1) Vulgate: Lt si quis non Uvisi-it in oro ooruro quippiain, 
sanotitioant super euru proelium. In contrast, our original 
offers: Lt qui nou eonseuserit ori eorum, sanotiUoant contra 
6um proelium. The interpretation refers to the latter. 


V. 7. And the showers shall be put to shame, and 
the diviners to scorn. 


Namely, because their lie will be revealed, since 
they have falsely preached peace. Therefore, when 
the calamity comes, when all the people will see that 
their lamentable destruction is imminent, as we have 
proclaimed before, then they will be convicted of the 
lie, and we will be found to be true. 


And must cover their mouths all. 


This is again taken from Moses and followed him 
in it. For this is how Moses speaks of a leper in the 
3rd book of Moses, Cap. 13, 45, that he should cover 
his mouth with the garment. So the prophet said here 
figuratively: They shall cover their lips, that is, they 
shall be so disgraced that they will not dare to speak 
to others. They will not be allowed to speak, nor will 
they be able to speak, because they will be quite 
miserably disgraced. So also the Germans say, 
"They will have to shut their mouths." 


Because there will be no God's word. 


Because the existing calamity will teach them 
what they taught, since God did not answer them.

v. 10: You who build Zion with

The prophet puts himself to it. But it is a Hebrew

expression: you with

magnificent palaces, very strong castles, but robbery 
and oppression of the poor provide you with the

he prophets had, namely such people who were 
exceedingly ungodly, and yet wanted to disguise their 
ungodliness with a certain holiness, as also the apostle 
Paul interprets it in the letter to the Romans [Cap. 2, 17. 
ff.]: "You rely on the law, and teach that one should not 
steal, and you steal" 2c. It is not possible that God 
should not hate this to the utmost, as we also see here.

| will restore the city to you and you will dwell safely 
in it; your captivity will not last long. So it happened, 
for the godly were finally brought back from Babylon, 
whose hearts God had awakened, as it says in Ezra 
1:5. And these are the wonderful counsels of God: 
He commands to proclaim both, the disturbance and 
the preservation; but the former because of the 
ungodly, the latter because of the godly, which must 
be well observed by all prophets. And so these 
wonderful counsels of the divine majesty were not 
heard by the godless, yes, even the godly could not 
understand them, which we see especially in 
Jeremiah, how he is astonished at the counsel of the 
Lord. For he says thus [Jer. 32:24. f.], "Behold, the 
city is besieged, that it must be won and given into 
the hands of the Chaldeans. "2c. "and thou, O LORD, 
sayest unto me, Buy thou a field for money, and take 
witnesses thereto, if the city be given into the hands 
of the Chaldeans?" 2c. But both have been fulfilled 
by GOD, as we have said. And this will be the summa 
of the two chapters that follow. 


V. i. But in the last days 2c. 

The Jews connect this text with the previous one 
in the previous chapter, and interpret it from the 
outward restoration of the kingdom, in this way: Zion 
shall be plowed, as it were, like a field, and 
Jerusalem like a heap of stones, and the mountain of 
the temple shall become a wild height, but at last | 
will restore this mountain, make it glorious again, and 
it shall at any rate be higher and more glorious than 
it ever was before. But this opinion does not please 
me. For it is certain that the later temple was not as 
great and glorious as the first, so that even some who 
had seen the first temple wept, as is evident from the 
history of Ezra, in the first book of Ezra, Cap. 3, 12. 


The mountain on which the Lord's house stands 
will surely be higher than all mountains. 

[Instead of praeparatus in the Vulgate,] paratus 
[should be read], 1) that is, certainly, 


1) Supplemented according to the Hall manuscript. 


reliably, as if he wanted to say: Now it has been made 
into a wild height, it is desolate and unbuilt, no 
building is on it, but it will be made certain and 
prepared again, in the same place where it is now. | 
will make it more famous and glorious in the whole 
world than it has ever been before, it will become 
more famous than all other temples. The Jews relate 
this not altogether badly to the worship in the temple 
before Christ, since even the Gentiles who embraced 
Judaism went up to the temple with the Jews in great 
multitudes. But my opinion is that for the sake of 
Christ this mountain became so very famous. 


V. 2. 2) For out of Zion shall go forth the law. 

For nowhere is the law but in Zion; in them is 
entrusted what God has spoken, as Paul says in the 
letter to the Romans [Cap. 3, 2]. We must therefore 
take the mountain not only according to the letter, nor 
Jerusalem only according to the letter, but also 
according to the spirit, following the apostle Paul in 
his letter to the Galatians [Cap. 4, 26.), that is, the 
holy church, which through Christ was exalted and 
glorified by the preaching of the gospel to all nations 
throughout the world, although it was necessary that 
the first place be an external one, where the gospel 
was first preached, and this was done through Christ 
and the apostles in the temple at Jerusalem. 


V. 3. He will judge among great nations. 

Christ seems to have seen this in Luc. 24, 47: "And 
had to preach repentance and forgiveness of sins in 
his name among all nations, and to raise it up in 
Jerusalem. For this is the power or fruit of the gospel 
sent forth from Jerusalem by this new king. He judges 
by the Word and the Spirit, but he will not judge the 
Jews alone, but many nations. 


And punish many heathens (Et arguet robustas gentes) 
"The gospel is the power of God that saves everyone who believes in it"

1, 16.]. Therefore it attacks the strong and the weak, 
everything that is high and glorious. And so this lowly 
word subdues everything that is exceedingly mighty 
and strong in the world. 


In distant lands. 

Not only in Jerusalem, but it will wander through 
the whole world, as the Psalm [Ps. 19, 5] says. This 
cannot be understood at all from the outward 
kingdom, because compared to this glory, the 
outward glory was nothing 2c. 


They will turn their swords into plowshares. 

This is a paraphrase of peace as it interprets itself: 
"No nation shall lift up a sword against another" 2c. 
Therefore the summa is: The gospel will work peace 
in all, they will turn war into peace. But he does not 
speak of physical peace, as some people wrongly 
think, who say that under the emperor Augustus 
there was peace on the whole earth. This is not true, 
since the world is always the same, always thirsting 
for blood, after the example of Cain, the first 
murderer. But he speaks of the peace that the Word 
works in Christians, who are ready to let go of the 
cloak with the robe, to have peace with all, not to 
quarrel in court, to suffer injustice 2c. And here again 
we see how this could not be understood of the 
restoration of the Kingdom. 


V. 4. 1) Without shyness (et non erit qui deterreat). 

The Hebrew says: and he will not fear. This 
phrase is taken from Moses. It means he will live in 
peace, he will stay in his house, will not be in the war 
camp, everything will be safe. 


For the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken. 


This is a confirmation to awaken faith. For even 
the saints, as we have said shortly before, could not 
understand the counsel of God from the disturbance 
of this so glorious and by God ordered kingdom, 
which the 


1) This section is still drawn to v. 3. in the Weimar. 





1213 


eternal promise had 2c., do not understand. 
Therefore, this piece confirms everything earlier. 


V. 5 For every nation will walk in the name of its 
God. 


He interprets in clear words what he had said 
above in somewhat darker words. Many nations will 
come to Mount Zion, but still not all; many will remain 
in their godlessness and idolatry, who will not walk 
"with" us to the house of the Lord, who will not accept 
the right faith of this new kingdom through Christ, but 
will persist in unbelief. But we will walk according to 
the new way, which will never cease. This light of the 
gospel will remain forever, this religion will have no 
end. And so this new and glorious and eternal 
kingdom consists in nothing else than your walking in 
the name of the Lord. It will not be distinguished by 
outward show or force of arms, which the kingdoms 
of the world are wont to do, but this is its main thing, 
that we live all that we live in the name of the Lord. 
This is the only name in which we must be blessed. 
The whole essence of this kingdom is that we believe 
in the name of Christ. 


Always and forever. 

These words comprehend the future resurrection 
from the dead. For this is how the prophets 
summarize the whole kingdom of Christ when they 
mention it once. They speak of it in other words and 
more gloriously and abundantly than we are able 
according to our poverty. We cannot walk in the name 
of the Lord forever in this mortal flesh, therefore this 
flesh must be raised again, which must die. We must 
be resurrected and transferred into this eternity with 
our eternal King. For the very short time when we 
sleep in death and wait with all the blessed for the 
glory of the children of God, as the apostle says, the 
prophets almost do not look at it, because it is a short 
moment. Therefore, they immediately include the 
resurrection and glorification of the blessed in this 
eternal kingdom 2c. 


1214 L. xxvi, 190-192. interpretations on the prophets. 


1215 





V. 6 At the same time, says the Lord, | will gather 
together the lame. 

With glorious words and promises he comforted 
the people, but they could not grasp these 
exceedingly rich promises at all, for the prophecies 
virtually disputed each other, namely that the 
kingdom should be disturbed and brought to nothing, 
and that the kingdom should be restored exceedingly 
splendidly and made more glorious than it had been 
before, and that the people would be stronger than 
they had ever been before. Namely, this seemed 
impossible to them, and they could not understand 
these prophecies, as we also noted above from 
Jeremiah about buying the field. In quite the same 
way he speaks here as if to say: | will not let you 
perish, however miserably you are afflicted and 
carried away into captivity; yet | will gather "the lame" 
again. This | lay out of punishment, that is, the people 
who are broken, whose kingdom is snatched away, 
who no longer flourish, since all things are snatched 
away from them siud, and they are led away into 
captivity. By such glorious promises, God's 
goodness has always encouraged the godly that 
even though they would have to go into captivity and 
suffer a little while, yet the time would only be a short 
one; they would be brought back and restored to their 
former freedom and glory 2c. But not by chance he 
adds: 


V. 7. 1) | will make the lame to have heirs, and will 
make the outcast a great nation. 

For here the flesh takes a quite extraordinary 
annoyance, and cannot understand the counsel of 
God that these promises are to be fulfilled in a 
miraculous way. The Lord had promised an eternal 
kingdom and a glorious return from captivity. 
Therefore, all the Jews thought that they should be 
preserved and brought back and transferred to the 
glorious and new kingdom. But the Lord says here 
that he will not preserve every lame person, but some 
remnant of these lame people. For after some years 


1) This verse number is missing in the Weimar, and the following is 
immediately attached to v. 6. - Vulgate: Ht ponam olAudioantsua in 





very few godly people were brought back from 
Babylon, namely those whose spirit God had 
awakened, as the history of Ezra says, Cap. 1, 5. He 
therefore separates the godly from the godless; the 
latter would remain in permanent captivity, the latter 
should be brought back and glorified. - "To the great 
people" (ingentemrobustam == to the strong people). 
Thus the church has become through the gospel in 
the whole world, against the gates of hell and all the 
attempts of sin; completely invincible against death, 
firmly founded on the solid rock Christ, her King, by 
whose Spirit she is quickened and strengthened from 
day to day, so that she may not fear or be overcome 
by any creature. 


And the LORD shall be king over them in mount 
Zion from henceforth even for ever. 


Here is a clear and distinct text of the deity of 
Christ. For this is also the name David gave in spirit 
to the promised Seed who would sit on His throne, 
Ps. 110, 1. 4. Christ Himself refers to this passage in 
the Gospel story [Marc. 12, 36. f.]. So he calls him 
also here "the Lord", who will be king over his people 
forever on the mountain Zion. And so this kingdom 
must not be a physical one, but a spiritual and eternal 
one, as we have abundantly said above. Therefore 
the kingdom will be a spiritual and eternal one, the 
king eternal and glorified, the people glorified and 
eternal in this kingdom. How else could he be the 
Lord and sit on the throne of his father David for 
eternity, if the people were not also eternal? But it 
cannot be eternal in the mortal body, not even in the 
dead body, but in the resurrected and glorified body. 
And here the prophet again includes the resurrection 
of the dead. 


Vv. 8. and thou tower boar, a stronghold of the 
daughter of Zion. 2) 

What we read [in the Vulgate), gregis, as a generic 
name, | think, should be read as a proper name, as 
also in the first book of Moses Cap. 35, 21, where 
Moses mentions this mountain: "And Israel went out, 


2) Vulgate: Lt tu turris Ars‘is nsduloZA lia 8ion. 


1216 L. XXVI, 192-194. interpretation of Micah (2.), Cap. 4, 8. 9. 


1217 





and erected a hut on the other side of the tower 
Eder." But it was a castle or a kind of tower or 
fortification. For instead of what we read, nebulosa, 
in Hebrew it means a castle. For so the Hebrew 
scholars say it the Hebrew word means a bulwark, a 
fortification 2c. We should therefore read thus, "And 
thou tower Eder, a stronghold of the daughter of 
Zion" 2c. Others interpret this passage from the 
temple in Jerusalem, which | do not approve. For 
nowhere else in Scripture is this house called a 
tower. | think that the prophet is speaking figuratively, 
that he calls the whole city of Jerusalem "the tower of 
Eder", or that the kingdom of the daughter of Zion has 
also come out of the city, that it has spread over the 
whole world, has reached all the Gentiles, so that in 
such a way "Eder" designates some unknown part of 
the country, because this mountain was otherwise 
not strange or famous. Therefore, this seems to me 
to be entirely the opinion: the gospel will be so 
powerful, and should be spread so far, will run with 
such great speed, that it will reach even completely 
unknown places of the earth, in short, to the end of 
the world. This is my opinion about this passage, | do 
not have a better one now, nor do | find it. 


Your golden rose will come, the previous dominion. 

He speaks as if to those who are in captivity, as if 
they were already taken away from the land, as if he 
wanted to say: It has happened to you, your kingdom 
has perished, but be confident, the former dominion 
will return; as you were a people before, not a 
prisoner, so you will also be completely free again 
after the captivity. You will not be abandoned, you will 
not remain in captivity forever, but you will return to 
your place. 


V. 9. Why do you now cling to other friends? 1) 
The prophet says all this to set the matter before 
us, as if to say: itis 


1) In Latin: Haars sr*o nune gMiZsris? which Luther, as the 
Zwickau manuscript shows, would have translated thus: Why are you 
grieving now? 


It is certain that you will be led away into captivity, 
since your sins deserve it. You will be miserably 
afflicted, and in such a way that you may think that 
you should never be led back, but be confident, | 
promise you that it will happen that you will be led 
back. And so the prophets everywhere hold forth 
threats and promises; threats for the sake of the 
wicked, promises for the sake of the godly. The 
following also belongs to this: 


Is the king not with you? 


Surely you shall not lack a king, nor shall you lack 
counselors and princes. With these words he 
removes the fearful doubts of the flesh, by which it is 
almost driven to despair. For the flesh cannot suffer 
the hand of the Lord at all, it must despair when the 
Lord strikes, since even the godly hardly understand 
this doing of the Lord, as we said above. So here the 
prophet alludes appropriately to the thoughts of the 
wicked, and again to the thoughts of the godly, 
through which they nevertheless have good hope 
even in the midst of persecution. In them the spirit 
represents them with inexpressible groaning, while 
they themselves do not know this. 


So that woe has come to you like one in childish 
distress? 


He used a very fine and appropriate simile, which 
Christ also uses in the Gospel of John, Cap. 16, 21. 
For such was the sorrow of the apostles and disciples 
that they thought it had happened to them, as a 
woman in childbearing is in danger of losing her life 
when she is to give birth. Such was the fearful 
distress of the church in its first beginning, as the 
disciples say, Luc. 24, 21: "We hoped that he would 
redeem Israel. And concerning all this, this day is the 
third day that such things have come to pass. "2c. We 
see quite the same thing here. The glorious and 
eternal kingdom was to be set up, but a birth had to 
take place first; but it could not come to birth without 
the greatest sadness and sorrow, as it is wont to be 
with women in childbirth. 


1218 L. XXVI, 194-196. interpretations on the prophets. 


1219 





And so the prophets interpret the Babylonian captivity 
no differently than the sorrow of a woman in childish 
distress. For this is how God in His goodness always 
deals with all the blessed in every challenge: first He 
afflicts us exceedingly, then He afflicts us and 
plunges us into hell to kill the lusts of the flesh, so that 
afterwards He may lead us out again and make us 
blessed. Meanwhile, the flesh does not know that this 
is the sorrow of a woman in childbirth, that a glorious 
birth will follow. The prophet encourages the people 
with this very reason, as if to say: endure, suffer, no 
matter how great the pain; a glorious offspring will 
follow. Just bear the hand of the Lord, without a doubt 
you will be saved, and you will bring forth an 
exceedingly abundant fruit. It is a short time, it will be 
only the sorrow of a woman in childbirth, which will be 
nothing at all when the birth has taken place. This 
likeness is extraordinarily beautiful, as Christ also 
rejoiced in the same [John 16:21]: "A woman when 
she gives birth has sorrow, but when she has given 
birth to the child, she no longer thinks of sorrow for 
the joy that the man is born into the world. And you 
also now have sadness" 2c. 


V. 10. Dear one, suffer such pain, and croak, you 
daughter of Zion. 


As we are used to encourage the women in 
childbirth by encouragement, so here the prophet 
also encourages the people by saying that they 
should bear the very short time of captivity, "take 
care" that it is only the sorrow of a woman in 
childbirth; it will happen that the birth will take place 
soon, it will be followed by exceedingly rich 
consolation, as he adds: 


For you must indeed go out to the city 2c. 


That is, | confess indeed, you will be taken away 
from the kingdom, [from] Jerusalem, that is truly 
difficult for you. You will go out of the city, that is, you 
will no longer 1) dwell in your cities, you will no longer 
have cities that are under- 


1) Here we have erased a non that is in our template. 





morsen, but will be subject to the Assyrian. You will 
suffer a miserable bondage, but it will not last; you 
will be delivered, the Lord will redeem you. Jeremiah 
interprets all of this more expansively [Cap. 25, 11. 
ff]. 


V. 11: For many nations will almost be gathered 
against you, saying, "She is banished" (prophanetur). 


Instead of what we read [in the Vulgate] lapidetur, 
2) it is more correct to read: prophanetur [it shall be 
desecrated], because it is in Moses where he says 
that through idolatry the land will be desecrated. So 
the opinion is: Your ungodliness deserves that you 
are led away captive; the enemies will gather against 
you 3) who thought it was completely done for you, 
they will cry out against you, they are completely 
confident that they will always rule over you; but be 
confident, you will destroy them, not they you. This 
was a strange sermon in the ears of the wicked. 


We want to see our desire for Zion. 


(Et videat in Syon oculus noster) is a Hebrew 
expression, which is also found in the 54th Psalm, v. 
9: "My eye will see pleasure in my enemies" (Suspexit 
oculus meus). But it means what we say in German, 
"| see my delight in them." For thus the adversaries, 
the enemies, set their teeth against the people of

king who will rule over all nations.

That he has brought them in heaps like sheaves on 
the threshing floor. 


And therefore he maketh great the number of thine 
enemies, that their destruction also may be the 
greater, that the Lord may destroy them the more. 
For the Lord has a way, that when he wants to 
destroy the wicked exceedingly, he first makes them 
great and glorious. He lifts them up high, so that they 
may take a heavier fall. This is what happened to the 
exceedingly powerful empire of the Assyrians, 
Romans 2c. 


V. 13. Therefore arise and thresh, O daughter of 
Zion. 


These are figurative speeches by which the 
prophet wanted to express the power and 
effectiveness of the gospel, as if he wanted to say: 
You will subdue all the Gentiles through the gospel, 
and that without weapons, only through the word, 
even if they now rule over you for a little while. 


So | will banish their goods to the Lord, and their 
possessions to the ruler of the whole world (et interficies 
Domino rapinas eorum), 

Thus it is written in Hebrew: et anathema facies 
Domino rapinas (hiera) eorum et facultates eorum 
etc., that is, by preaching the gospel you will snatch 
away from the ungodly the best people and bring 
them under the spell of Christ 1); you will win them 
for Christ, and thus the glory of this kingdom will 
become greater and greater through’ the 
effectiveness of the preached gospel. This figure of 
speech is also used by Christ Luc. 11, 12: "If a 
stronger man comes over him and overcomes him, 
he takes away his armor, on which he relied, and 
distributes the plunder." 


V. 14. But now, you warrior, arm yourself (Tunc 
vastaberis filia latronis). 

Also this piece belongs absolutely still to the 
preceding. One has this from the god- 


1) In anatiiema Ciiristo - that they may be sanctified to Christ. 


The interpretation is that the synagogue, which sat 
against the prophets and killed them 2c. But | do not 
see how their interpretation can be connected with 
the preceding. | will venture an interpretation and 
explain it this way: | hold that the prophet still remains 
and continues to describe the future vengeance 
against the Gentiles after the kingdom of Judah was 
restored, and believe that he calls Babylon "the 
warrior woman." Incidentally, we read [in the Vulgate] 
unrhymed: filia latronis, just as Jerome has 
translated latrunculi everywhere in the sacred history 
where it should have been translated by the word 
"man of war". So here, instead of filia latronis, we 
read: "you warrior", that is: You Babylon, who are 
armed with weapons and war hordes, and very rough 
in your thinking and striving for war, 2) who make 
everyone uncomfortable, who cannot easily be 
resisted, and whom you, armed, attack everyone. 
And this whole passage | translate after the Hebrew 
simply in such a way: Then one will also make war 
against you, you warrior, who against lins the siege. 
Therefore the opinion is: The daughter of Zion will 
banish to the Lord all the possessions of the 
Gentiles. Among this booty will also be you, Babylon, 
who are now well practiced and very powerful in 
warfare, who now take up the siege against us. Now 
you are destroying Jerusalem, you will be destroyed 
by us again. What you do in the flesh will be done to 
you in the spirit through the gospel. 


And strike the judge of Israel on the cheeks with the 
rod. 


That is, they regard the judges as the very least 
people, treat them quite ignominiously. Jerome and 
other interpreters relate this to the suffering of Christ, 
but what they write is violently twisted.

The seventh chapter. 


In this last chapter, the prophet concludes his entire 
prophecy in general by punishing the perverse and 
godless customs. He proclaims the captivity and the 
future salvation. He is anxious for the people. He 
anxiously does everything to convert the people to the 
good, as a faithful shepherd is wont to do. He compares 
himself to a vine dresser or to the one who visits the 
vineyard and gathers the remains, and still does not find 
what he desires. This passage is taken from Genesis, 
and so in other passages, Isa. 5, 7. The gatherer or 
vineyard keeper is the prophet who goes through the 
people 2c. and finds nothing but the wicked. 


V. 1.4 [Oh, | am like one who is slackening in the 
vineyard, where no grapes are to be found]. 


4) The following his V. 3. is in the Weimar edition without indication 
of a verse number still drawn to the introduction of the chapter.

As those who gather figs, Autumnus [Herbstl does 
not stand here. In Amos 6) [Cap. 8, 1. f.] the same word 
is [XXX]: Behold, a container, since the fattening cattle 
are gathered in the container 2c. Ficus [figs] or that 
which is gathered. Similarly, summer also means. [It has 
happened to me] like [one who] seeks grapes in the

Altenburg manuscript this passage is interpreted as follows. In Hosea 
there is no such passage.

a husbandman and a father of a family who visits his 
vineyard and wants fruit 2c. Notice what is said about 
the cursed fig tree [Matth. 21, 18. ff.] 2c. Quite 
similarly it is said in Isaiah, Cap. 5, 2: | thought | 
would find berries and grapes 2c. but | have been 
deceived 2c. "Would that there were a good man 
among them!" So much is missing, that so many 
berries would be there, that | could squeeze a grape. 
| desire the firstfruits, that is, | have not found so 
much that | could give the firstfruits to the priests; 
hardly do | find that | can eat myself. He understands 
combs that are full of berries 2c. This is not to be 
understood of the supernumeraries: he _ finds 
absolutely nothing but combs of grapes and leaves 
without grapes 2c. 


V. 2 [The pious people (sanctus) are gone in this land 

They are expressive words. "Holy" (sanctus) is he 
who has obtained mercy. He opposes truth to 
hypocrisy; [ne means one who is] holy before God 
and righteous in his walk 2c. Thus love is 
extinguished, that each seeks his own, and cares not 
that his brother perish. They are full of hatred and 
envy, which takes place where love is not. Each one 
seeks to drive his brother out of his possession. 


Each one chases the other to destroy him. 1) 

Mortem, that is, that he banish him (anathema); 
[this happens when] something is made nothing, and 
irretrievably. The banished was not loosed, 3 Mos.

again. He does not find the firstfruits, that is, true 
saints, but hypocrites. He did not want them. 


V. 3. and think they do well when they do evil. 

Not that they were so extraordinarily foolish that 
they would have considered the robbery something 
sacred 2c. He is talking about the thoughts and 
actions of the hypocrites. That is, according to the 
truth they are not holy, but they are 


1) Vulgate: Vir tratrsm suum aa martern venatur. 


have the ambition [ to appear holy, they pretend], 2) 
which is absolutely not according to the truth. In that 
of which they most boast, they are most to be blamed 
2c. [Matth. 7, 18.:] "They come in sheep's clothing" 
2c. In Isaiah [Cap. 5, 20.] it says: "They turn light into 
darkness" 2c. That, in which God has the most 
abomination, that they praise the most. 


What the prince wills, the judge will speak. 

The prince demands, and the judge adheres to 
him in his decisions (adhaeret in reddendo), he 
collects the new taxes 2c. Another sense is this: the 
prince, any one who is among them, is a promoter, a 
distresser; they do not serve the commonwealth, 
they do not protect the good 2c. But the judge est in 
reddendo, that is, he takes gifts. The princes are 
wolves, the judges unjust, because they judge 
according to what is given to them; they look to gifts. 
The judge is after gifts, that is, if you give him, he will 
give you justice; if you do not give him, he will not 
give you justice. See the tenth Psalm, which is about 
the Antichrist. 


s[The mighty counsel according to their will of

The great ones order what they want, they do not 
benefit the people 2c.; they corrupt the people

have it] "gewirret in each other". Thus it is written in 
the 2nd Psalm, v. 3 [: "Let us cast away from us their 
cords], and elsewhere [Ps. 118, 27.]: in condensis. 3) 
This people is completely without order and law, they 
do what they want. The people are without law, the 
princes without fear 2c. A proverb:

no peace, for the kingdom will be disturbed, you will 
go as captives to Assyria. And yet there will be peace, 
but a different peace and in a different way than you

miserably afflicted; you will first suffer the violence 
and vengeance of the Assyrian who will trample our 
palaces. But you have not recognized the way of

For seven shepherds and eight princes shall be 
raised up over him. 


He will indeed take revenge on you, he will afflict 
you miserably, but afterwards we will retaliate against 
him again, he will be subdued again. We will send 
against him seven shepherds and eight common 
officers 1) (praefectos gregario). This seems to be an 
extraordinarily foolish prophecy, that against such an 
exceedingly powerful kingdom seven shepherds and 
eight common or lowly (plebeios) officials are sent. 
For these shall again destroy the kingdom of the 
Assyrians. But everything goes to the spiritual 
kingdom, that is, we will not attack the Assyrian (eum) 
by force of arms, not with auxiliary troops supported 
by mighty princes of the world, but we will send to 
them shepherds, some uneducated chiefs of the 
people, who will preach the gospel, and by their 
preaching will subdue that whole kingdom, that is, | 
will send to them apostles, lowly and common men, 
not mighty. And this is it that he saith, Eight leaders 
of men out of the people, that is, lowly and base. For 
that others interpret it from the leaders of the 
Persians, and | know not what others, is nothing. 
Then believe

| think that the prophet used a certain number for an 
indefinite one to indicate that through a small team, 
through very few, despised and lowly people, the 
exceedingly powerful empire of the Assyrians should 
be converted to the obedience of faith 2c. For the 
same expression is found elsewhere, in Ecclesiastes 
Cap. 11, 2: "Divide out among seven and among 
eight," that is, "Always surrender." 


V. 5. 2) Who destroy the land of Assyria with the 
sword. 


Pascent in gladio, that is, with the word of GOD, 
your sword of the Spirit, as the apostle [Eph. 6:17.] 
says. 


And the land of Nimrod with their bare arms. 


| will rather translate the Hebrew word by sword 
[than by in lanceis]. But the opinion of this passage is 
the same that Christ expressed Matth. 10, 34. in other 
words: "| did not come to send peace, but the sword. 
For | am come to stir up man against his Father. "2c. 
So he says here: | will send them the word; if the same 
be believed, they shall convert one another; the father 
shall attack the son, the son the father. And "so shall 
we be delivered from Assyria", that is, if we have been 
led away into captivity by the Assyrians before, if we 
have gone entirely to reasons, then again the 
Assyrians will be overcome after this new king has 
come and the new kingdom has been set up, and it 
does not take place that we hope this king will come if 
you have not been led away into captivity before 2c. 


V. 6. The rest of Jacob will also be among many 
peoples. 


Having indicated the vengeance that was to be 
inflicted on the kingdom of the Assyrians because of 
the captivity of the kingdom of Israel, he now describes 
by what power this vengeance was to be carried out, 
namely by the overriding of the kingdom of the 
Assyrians.

from Jacob. He describes the power and the ministry of 
the apostles and the other first preachers of the gospel, 
what kind of people they would be, first among the Jews, 
from whom they were taken, then among all peoples in 
the whole world. - Among many peoples", because at 
that time the synagogue was populous, since many 
Gentiles had also converted to Judaism, as can be seen 
from the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. And 
this prophecy certainly looks to the day of Pentecost, 
when, after the Holy Spirit was sent from heaven, the 
apostles spoke in many tongues, as the book of Acts 
shows. 


Like a dew from the Lord. 


That is, they will be sent by the Holy Spirit, not by 
men; the thing will be done from heaven without human 
counsel or human action. Encouraged by the Spirit, they 
will drip the sweet gospel, just as the dew comes down 
from heaven on the seeds and flowers, watering and 
moistening the earth without our knowing it. So also they 
will preach after the Holy Spirit is sent from heaven 2c. 
Paul interpreted it 1 Cor. 3, 6. thus, "I planted, Apollo 
watered, but GOD gave the flourishing" 2c. [v. 9. "For 
we are GOD's fellow workers, you are GOD's field work 
and GOD's building." Thus the gospel is a dew sent 
down from heaven, and the apostles are called a dew by 
the gospel which they preach, because they water the 
grass, that is, they water the people by preaching the 
word of the gospel 2c. 


That waits for no one. 


That is, it does not wait for the hand of man, it is not 
added by the works and efforts of man, but it comes forth 
by itself without any processing. It shows the 
effectiveness and power of the believed gospel, against 
the preachers of the law, who know nothing else than 
that they press and force with their preaching. They 
cannot give the power to fulfill the law or a willing heart, 
but rather they refuse to do so. 





they increase wrath and sin through this compulsion. 
The same comparison as here is also in the 72nd Psalm, 
v. 16: "It will be green in the cities, like grass on the 
earth", that is, only through the word, and filled with the 
Holy Spirit, they will bear fruit voluntarily without human 
work and contribution, not forced by the fear of 
punishment, like the people of the law, who are forced 
by force and laws. The prophet says the same thing 
here: the gospel will be enough for them, the Spirit will 
teach them all truth, they will not need to be taught the 
doctrines and statutes of men, but of their own free will 
they will be good, the others from Jacob dropping dew 
on them. This happened on the day of Pentecost, when 
Peter and the other apostles were preaching. Thus he 
distinguishes the people of the law from the people of 
the gospel, who are a willing people, who do not have to 
be forced by laws or statutes, but are carried away by 
the impulse of the Holy Spirit out of free cords to do 
good. For they are driven by the Spirit of God, as the 
apostle says [Rom. 8:14]. 


V. 7. 1) [Yes, the remnant of Jacob will be among 
the Gentiles among many peoples). 


They will be such people also "among the Gentiles", 
that is, in the church of the Gentiles, not only among the 
Jews, as we said above. And this is the spiritual 
conquest of the Gentiles by the word of the Gospel. For 
the apostles and the other first preachers of the gospel, 
who were taken from the Jews, are the heads and the 
foundation [Eph. 2:20], or made princes of the earth, as 
the Psalm says, that is, they are the foundation of the 
church in the whole world, both among the Gentiles and 
the Jews. 


Like a lion among the animals in the forest. 


These are figurative speeches with which he 
indicates the power of the Word and the power of the 
Spirit, as if to say: Just as a lion robs, takes flight, throws 
down, when he

1230 L. xxvi, 20S-M7. Interpretations on the prophets. 


1231 





If the word of the gospel breaks into the herds of 
cattle, it will also subdue everything. For the gospel 
has broken through with the greatest power and 
force, tearing apart and destroying the kingdoms of 
the Gentiles, so that they could not escape its power 
and destruction. For the kingdoms, however mighty 
and great, have been converted as that of the 
Assyrians, Romans 2c. It is completely the same as 
what he said above Cap. 4, 13: "I will make you horns 
of iron and claws of brass" 2c. So the prophet often 
repeats the same thing, but with different words and 
prophetic images, and out of the fullness of the Spirit. 


V. 9: In that day, saith the LORD, will | put away thy 
horses from thee. 


He adds this to indicate that he is not speaking of 
the physical kingdom, but of the spiritual kingdom, 
otherwise it does not fit with the preceding, in which 
he promises victory against all the Gentiles, which 
certainly cannot be understood of outward power or 
weapons, but spiritually, through the preaching of the 
Gospel, which is a power of God. Thus he says here: 
You will be subject to all the Gentiles, you will subdue 
all, but you will be inactive in all the earth, you will 
have nothing in the way of weapons, not horses, not 
castles, not fortifications and counselors to rely on, 
and yet you will overcome all the Gentiles through the 
Gospel, namely this is the power and might of GOD 
2c. But meanwhile the apostles are as it were 
destined to die, as it is said in 1 Cor. 4, 11: "We suffer 
hunger and thirst and siud naked and are beaten" 2c. 
Likewise 2 Cor. 6, 4. f.: "In great patience, in 
tribulations, in distresses, in beatings, in prisons" 2c. 
[v. 10. .:] "As the poor, yet making many rich; as 
having nothing in themselves, yet having all things." 
Hence the opinion of this passage: | will put away thy 
horses from thee, | will take away thy chariots, that is, 
| will make thee so minded as to despise all splendor 
and all powers of the flesh; | will give thee another 
power, other weapons, by which thou shalt prevail 
against all the heathen. You shall not rely on human 
strength, but from the 








Heaven | will send you strength and power to subdue 
everything. 


V. 11. 1) And will cut off the sorcerers from you. 

There are many words in Hebrew that mean 
soothsayers. Moses, in the fifth book, Cap. 18, 10. f., 
brought almost all of them together; we have made a 
distinction as much as we could, so that they would 
be understood. And | translate the Hebrew word, 
which our Latin translation has given by maleficia, by 
the word augur; but it means those who tell fortunes 
from the flight of birds and foretell future things. And 
instead of divinationes, which we read, | translate 
conjectores, that is, those who interpret signs, 
whether in the heavens or on earth, as, strange births 
and other such things. With these words, however, he 
covertly pulls through the false prophets and stabs 
them, as if he wanted to say: | will cause you to no 
longer use the counsels of men, since they are vain, 
as the Psalm says (Ps. 94, 11.sh | will take them away 
from you, since they have nothing certain and firm; 
they only assume, they cannot determine anything 
certain. But this one thing must certainly take place, 
that we may be quite certain in our consciences about 
the word which we either teach or by which we are 
taught, which human teachings cannot accomplish. 
For the conscience is still uncertain about the will of 
God, and the teachers of human statutes cannot 
strengthen and establish dismayed and frightened 
consciences. Thus says the 14th Psalm, v. 3: 2) 
"They know not the way of peace." Likewise (v. 5. 
Vulg.], "There they fear, since there is nothing to fear." 
But the gospel makes the conscience certain and 
gives it peace 2c. So everything is said here 
comparatively, as if he wanted to say: Now you rely 
on your castles, your fortifications and your power of 
arms, likewise on idolatry and carnal counselors, but 
| will take all that from you, | will make everything 
completely firm and certain for you.

V. 12. 1) That you should no longer worship the 
work of your hands. 


That is, the idols. This way of speaking is also 
frequent in Moses. Also those worship the work of their 
hands who trust in their works and in the righteousness 
of the flesh, for this is making an idol. Otherwise, without 
this trust, an idol is nothing, as the apostle says [1 Cor. 
8:4], but that in which | trust, in which | rely, and to which 
| ascribe righteousness, is in truth in the place of God, 
as we have said above quite abundantly of the image of 
God. In short, | will destroy your groves and destroy this 
false worship and the powers of which you now still have 
much and on which you rely. Then the complete and 
right worship will be there through the Word and the 
Spirit. 


V.14. And | will take vengeance with fury and wrath 
on the nations that will not obey. 


1) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 





He adds a threat; he threatens the despisers with 
misfortune, so that the greatness of such a great good 
deed is not left unnoticed, as if he wanted to say: 
Although this is the highest grace and eternal life, it will 
still happen that few will believe; will not be accepted. 
For though the gospel is the power of God, yet it is an 
offense to the Jews and a foolishness to the Gentiles, 1 
Cor. 1:23. But | will not suffer it to be despised with 
impunity, for | will avenge it on the despisers. Therefore 
he said this for the terror of the wicked, who despise and 
persecute the word of the gospel, that they would suffer 
punishment from him; then also for the comfort of the 
preachers of the word, that they may persevere in their 
profession and carry out their ministry faithfully, however 
much they may see that the gospel is despised by the 
world. Likewise, they should suffer the persecutions of 
the wicked and take vengeance for despising the word 
of God, following the example of Christ, who reserved 
vengeance for the one who judges righteously, 1 Pet 
2:23. 


The sixth chapter. 


In these two previous chapters he has generally 
finished the prophecy of Christ and the reign of Christ 
through the gospel. Now he returns to his ministry in 
what follows, namely by punishing the ungodliness of 
the people. First of all, however, he attacks their lives, 
as is the way of all prophets, that they first attack 
ungodliness as the source and well of evil works, and 
then present godliness. When this has been taught and 
inculcated, then the good works follow in a suitable 
manner. This is the correct order of the prophets and 
apostles, as can be clearly seen in the epistles of Paul. 
But this is not done by false teachers, who only teach 
about life, punish vices and offer rewards, completely 
ignoring the doctrine of godliness and justification of the 
heart 2c. 





V. 1. Listen to what the Lord says. 


As | said, he is completely in the process of punishing 
life and vice. But he proceeds with great boldness, 
because he is sent by the Lord and driven to do so. 2) 


Scolds the mountains. 


Lead the cause against the mountains. For thus it is 
more correctly translated [than in the Vulgate], as it is 
also translated in the 43rd Psalm, v. 1. "Lead my cause." 
Hence the opinion is, Set thyself against the mountains, 
that is, the princes; punish them for their ungodliness, 
show them their shameful deeds and sins.

1234 L. XXVI, 2N9-2I1. Interpretations on the prophets. 


1235 





And let the hills hear your voice.’ 

"The hills," that is, the very mighty and rich, who 
excel above others, who are more glorious than 
others. As everywhere in the whole of Scripture, so 
also here we see that the word of God attacks the 
proud, the high, and that which is glorious and holy 
according to your reputation, in short, that which the 
world esteems great. "For what is foolish in the sight 
of the world God has chosen to put to shame the 
wise, and what is weak in the sight of the world God 
has chosen to put to shame what is strong" 2c., 1 Cor. 
1, 27. 


V. 3. 1) Together with the strong foundations of the 
earth. 

That is, you princes, kings, priests and prophets 
on whom the people rely. But he calls them [in the 
Vulgate fortia] "hard" with a special epithet, that is, 
strong and mighty from the earth. 


For the LORD will rebuke his people, and will 
punish Israel. 

He distinguishes his people from Israel, so that we 
can already see from this that the prophet speaks 
when the kingdom of Israel still existed and was in 
bloom, so that we should learn that in the prophets 
there is not always the right order of the chapters, 
which can be seen quite clearly in Jeremiah, and 
indeed very often. For it is possible that these two last 
chapters preceded the others, which mentioned that 
Israel had already been taken away. It is useful to 
keep this in mind when reading the prophets. 


V. 3. What have | done to you, my people? 

This is an advancement and remembrance of the 
good deeds done, by which he urges them and puts 
the matter before them, as if to say: Why do you do 
this, that my name gets an evil sound among the 
Gentiles, since you, devoted to your godless nature, 
give the Gentiles an opportunity to blaspheme my 
name? He imitated Moses, Deut. 32, 6: "Do you thus 
give thanks to the LORD your God, you foolish and 
foolish people? Is he not thy father and thy LORD?" 
2c.

V. 4. | brought you out of Egypt. 


Now he remembers the good deeds done. First of 
all, the execution from the miserable servitude in 
Egypt, which is imprinted everywhere in the Scriptures. 
He wanted to show them this exodus 2) as an outward 
sign, by which they would be reminded of the divine 
goodness, so that they would not doubt that they would 
be saved from any danger and misfortune, no matter 
how great, if they believed and remembered the 
execution from Egypt. Thus he has given us the 
outward signs of grace, baptism and Holy Communion, 
by which we are to remember what has been granted 
to us through the gospel and will be granted to 
believers forever. 


V. 5 My people, remember what Balak king of Moab 
foretold. 


This is another blessing. By the former he reminded 
them of salvation from Pharaoh's might and all his 
power; by the latter he reminded them of salvation from 
cunning and guile, namely, that Balaam could not harm 
them, who had come to curse them, Numbers 22 and 
23. 22 and 23. But as the Lord had made Pharaoh's 
strength, forces, power and authority weak and 
ineffective and nullified, but the weakness of his people 
strong and powerful, so he turned Balaam's curse into 
a blessing. These are benefits that he still shows to all 
the godly, and they are certainly very great. 


From Sittim to Gilgal. 3) 


"Sittim" is a place or a field in the fields of Moab, 
from which the people of Israel had pitched camp. It 
extends from Moab to the Jordan, Num. 25, 1. Jos. 3, 
1.

1236 L. XXVI, 211-213. interpretation of Micah (2.), Cap. 6, 5-8. 


1237 





By this you should know how the Lord has done 
you all good. 

In Hebrew it says: propter scientiam justitiarum 
Domini. This is ambiguous and darkly spoken, so it 
can be understood in two ways. First, that you may 
know the righteousness of the Lord; second, that you 
may know, that the righteousness of the Lord may be 
known (but it amounts to almost the same thing), that 
is, that you may know that you are not preserved by 
your works, nor anyone by his strength, but by 
confidence in me, by my blessing, not by the work or 
merit of any man. And so | interpret the righteousness 
of the Lord in a suffering way, that is, of the 
righteousness with which he justifies us, as Paul used 
it several times in the letter to the Romans. 


V. 6. 1) With what shall | propitiate the Lord? 

The prophet interprets himself. But the opinion is: 
With what shall | propitiate the Lord, that | may 
forestall the wrath of him? It will come to pass that he 
will proceed against you with punishment, and you 
will seek to forestall him, but you will be mistaken; 
your worship, which you undertake, is ungodly. The 
heart is unclean, therefore no works, however good 
they may be 2c. 


With stooping before the high God? 

Here is a clear and obvious text against the works 
of righteousness, which is written in Isaiah in the first 
chapter [v. 11. f.] with many words. He clearly 
condemns the vices and outward works, as good as 
they may appear to be, if the heart is not pure. For 
God does not like the works of an impure and ungodly 
heart, even those which he himself has otherwise 
commanded, as can be clearly seen in Isaiah and 
here, that even the works commanded by the law, as 
the sacrifices, are rejected, because they performed 
them with confidence in them and in carnal 
righteousness. Since the things required by the law 
of God are not valid without faith, how much less will 
the imaginary works of our monks be valid 2c. 


1) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 





V. 7. 2) Or shall | give my first son for my 
transgression? 


The Gentiles sacrificed their sons and daughters 
to the idol Moloch. The Jews, too, had fallen into this 
ungodliness, thinking that they would follow the 
example of Abraham by sacrificing their children to 
God. This is what the prophet alludes to. See 5 Blos. 
12, 31. 


V. 8. It is told you, man, what is good. 


Here is a very good teacher who not only punishes 
what is ungodly and wrong, but also shows what is 
godly and right. For the office of the prophets is not 
only to punish the outward, evil customs, but above 
all hypocrisy, so that the hopeful hypocrites may 
humble themselves and become ashamed, who by 
their hypocrisy offend God to the highest degree, 
while in the meantime they think that they alone are 
pleasing to God. But God wants truly righteous and 
truly holy people, not hypocrites, whom He hates to 
the utmost. We see the same here in an excellent 
way. The prophet is calling the people back to the 
true, pure and truly good godliness, which he has 
summarized entirely in these three elements: 
"Keeping God's word, practicing love and being 
humble before God." Because the prophet has so far 
attacked their godless outward life, he here moves on 
to the right worship or the truly good life that God 
demands of the godly. 


Keeping God's word (Facere judicium). 

| have interpreted this phrase several times above 
in other prophets. But it means that one should not 
hurt anyone, that one should give each his own, that 
one should not be burdensome to anyone, that one 
should help others, that one should promote their 
advantage, that one should prevent harm and 
violence. To prevent harm and violence, so that the 
poor are not overprivileged and oppressed by the 
rich, and so that the guilty are punished and the 
innocent are protected 2c. And this is what is said in 
Jer. 7:5: "That ye do justice one against another," that 
is, that ye restrain the wicked and protect the good. 
Therefore, this applies to all the people the prophet is 
referring to, 


2) This verse number is missing in Weimar's.

1239 





that it is meant to be close to the public, so that each 
one can enjoy his own with peace while maintaining 
the state of the community. But he expressly says: 
"Keep God's word" (kapere), because he wants this 
to be done by deed, not merely by words. In this 
single statement he has summarized a good part of 
Christian conduct or Christian morals, for violence 
against one's neighbor is forbidden, then the evil 
desire that | should not covet one's neighbor's goods, 
that | should not wish him ill, that | should protect him, 
that | should keep dangers away from him 2c. 
Whoever does this will soon incur the hatred of many 
people, for it will displease tyrants and others who 
harm the poor to resist them. Therefore, he who 
resists them cannot do so without risking his position 
and his life. And so persecution follows immediately, 
since the devil cannot do these things, which are truly 
good works, but he can do hypocrisy, which he also 
promotes and causes, since through it he leads 
people away from true godliness, from faith in God 
through his works and his own righteousness. The 
flesh hears and says this easily, but does not do it, 
nor is it able to do it, unless renewed by the Spirit. 


And practice love (Diligere misericordiam). 


This means that it pleases us to be kind to 
others. For the Hebrew word means actual mercy, 
which is shown, as also Christ indicates Matth. 9, 13: 
"Go and learn what this is: | am pleased with mercy 
and not with sacrifice. God does not demand anything 
of us in terms of good works, but wants everything to 
be for the benefit and advantage of our neighbor; it is 
enough for God that we give Him glory through these 
works. Faith is the beginning of justification, as all 
Scripture teaches. After we have been justified by 
faith, we can do nothing to God, nor should we, 
except the sacrifice of praise, that is, that we bear 
witness by our preaching of the grace we have 
received, that we praise God, that we proclaim His 
glory, and that is 


through the gospel. Then we should show mercy to 
our neighbor, that is, it should be a pleasure for us to 
help our neighbor, we should seize every opportunity 
to help our neighbor and also encourage others to do 
acts of love, so that our whole life will be for the good 
of our neighbor, since we owe no one anything other 
than to love one another, Rom. 13, 8. 


And be humble before your God (Et sollicitum ambulare 
cum Deo tu). 


The prophet is definitely talking about the good 
behavior that we should show towards our neighbor. 
He condemns all other works, even those that 
appear to be extremely holy, by which the godless 
hypocrites thought they were pleasing God, while in 
the meantime they were miserably afflicting and 
harming the poor, and were exploiting them with 
robbery and extortion and ungodly usury. This third 
thing he adds here is certainly an extremely 
necessary admonition, since there is danger when 
we are justified by faith, we want to become 
lukewarm, we want to become puffed up, we want to 
be tickled by the gifts of the spirit, which we have 
ahead of others, we want to please ourselves, 1) as 
if he wanted to say: If you do what | say, if you take 
your neighbor into consideration, see to it that you 
are not sure that you do not have a sham eye, that 
you do not please yourself and try to get for yourself 
the praise and honor that is due to God alone. Even 
the most spiritual people cannot be without this 
exceedingly wicked self-love. Immediately when they 
see that they are better than others, that they are 
more learned than others, and that they have 
received more spiritual gifts, they please themselves 
well; immediately they despise others inferior to 
themselves. For grace and good works also by their 
nature delight men. Scripture has presented us with 
a frightening example in Saul, who shone by very 
good works. There was not a finer man in Israel, as 
the Scripture says 1 Sam. 9, 2, and full of the Spirit 
of the Lord, but this

1241 





he lacked what Micah demands here, therefore he fell 
exceedingly badly and was even terribly rejected by 
God. It is a quite correct word of the holy fathers, with 
which they used to punish this godless self-love 
(giAauTiav): Wherever you may throw a thistle head, it 
always stands upright. Thus this exceedingly evil 
disposition has crept into the hearts of the saints at all 
times; they cannot be without it. And this is the only evil 
that attaches itself to good works, as St. Augustine says 
in his Rule. That is why God often lets His saints fall in 
an exceedingly shameful way, as Peter, the very holy 
David, so that they, frightened and humiliated by a very 
heavy fall, would always stand in fear, so that they would 
not rise above it and realize how weak they still are. So 
also David cries out in the 51st Psalm, v. 5: "My sin is 
always before me." Thus, the saints should be humbled 
by the sight and knowledge of their weakness and sin, 
and refrain from puffing themselves up because of their 
good works or gifts of the Spirit that they have received 
from God. And this is "to walk carefully with God," that 
is, to think moderately and lowly of oneself, to walk with 
a simple eye, to always want to be hidden, and to seek 
and seek no glory, no honor from good works; this the 
exceedingly poor self-love and that godless disposition 
cannot do. For it always wants everything it does to be 
seen, wants it to be known to all, so that it may gain 
honor and praise for itself, so that it may be praised 
before men 2c. Here belongs completely what Christ 
teaches Matth. 6, 3. f.: "When you give alms, do not let 
your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that 
your alms may be hidden" 2c., and [v. 5.]: When you 
pray, you should not be like the hypocrites 2c. So we are 
to be modest, and communicate out of a simple 
conscience, and do everything, whatever it may be, in 
such a way that we want no one to know. Therefore, 
those who are rich in the gifts of God before others, and 
those who must preside over others through the ministry 
of the word, which is not the business of common 
people, are in great danger. For even the most holy 
Lenten people have always complained about this evil, 
and could not be without it, no matter how hard they 
tried. 


to be set aside. Here belongs what is written in Sirach 
1), Cap. 3, 20: "The higher you are, the more you humble 
yourself" 2c. 


V. 9: The voice of the Lord will call over the city. 


This is a new section and a completely new teaching 
or sermon. For it is not all prophesied at once by the 
prophets, as we have reminded you several times 
above, but one thing at this time, another at another. 
Now the opinion is: It is the voice of the Lord with which 
| speak to you, not mine. He himself preaches through 
me; he uses me only as an instrument for the preaching 
of his word, and not in vain, for blessed are they that fear 
the name of the Lord, but not blessed are they that fear 
him not. For the Hebrew word, which our Latin 
interpreter translated by salus, | believe, actually means 
well-being, success, and that which goes out happily 
and well. So the same word is in Proverbs Cap. 8, 14: 
"Mine is both counsel and action, | have understanding 
and might," that is, by me is right counsel, otherwise, if | 
do not counsel, is bad counsel, and by me the counsels 
are also carried out happily; | give happiness and 
prosperity, that what men counsel also goes forth 
happily 2c. Thus, | believe, we have attained the true 
meaning of the word. Next, when he says, "about the 
city," the singular stands for the plural. For he addresses 
all the cities, just as in Hebrew the text reads: the voice 
of the Lord calls city by city (op- pidatim), that is, the 
Lord sends his word throughout the whole kingdom of 
Israel. The apostle Paul also uses this idiom quite nicely 
in the letter to Titus Cap. 1, 5: "Occupy the cities to and 
fro (CaTa& TI6A@) with elders."

The same expression is in Proverbs 16:11: "Right weight

are his works", where our books read saeculi in an 
inconsistent way. Thus the Lord says here, namely: 
"Should | then approve your unjust weight and false

these deceptions, they deceive the neighbor, as is the 
custom of our merchants, who do not care about 
godliness, if they only bring money and goods to 
themselves. 


V. 13. Therefore | will also begin to plague you. 


This must be read [instead of coepi percutere] in the 
present time, just as when we say in German, 
"Therefore | will also lift." It is a wonderful judgment 
of GOD. While the wicked want to propitiate God 
through the worship they perform, they irritate Him 
even more, and while they want to obtain money and 
goods through robbery and evil artifices with which 
they deceive their neighbor, they finally come to the 
extreme lack. Thus God is wrong with the perverse, 
as it is said in the 18th Psalm, v. 27. Thus those 
goods, which are thus acquired with injustice, 
however much and great they may be, have no other 
end in store for them than that they will completely 
decay, as he said above Cap. 1, 7: "They are 
gathered from whores’ wages, and shall also become 
whores' wages again.” And our princes today can 
expect nothing better, who know nothing else than to 
suck the belongings of the poor and to collect many 
treasures; while they could help many with a hundred 
or a thousand florins given for the benefit of the poor, 
they give nothing. They have no regard for the poor 
and are only eager to enrich themselves. Afterwards, 
they will be forced to squander many thousands of 
florins on the godless men of war, when war has 
arisen through God's judgment. "Then it will be for the 
lancers." Others will sell theirs with whores, and 
however much property may come to the heirs, they 
will scatter it in the most shameful way. This is God's 
judgment, which we do not lack; no one expects 
anything better for himself. Easy come, easy go; the 
wages of whores shall be restored.

as we, taught by experience, must confess that this 
is true. 


V. 14. You shall not have enough to eat. 

That is, | will give you a famine in such a way that, 
1) even if you eat, it will not be enough to satisfy the 
hunger through meals. Food will come to you in bits 
and pieces, but you will never be full. 


And shall languish (Et erit incurvatio in medio tui). 

It is the same word in the 38th Psalm, v. 7: "| walk 
crookedly (curvatus sum) and very stooped, all day 
long | walk sadly." But the opinion is as if he wanted 
to say: | will see to it that you are oppressed more 
and more every day; | will bring about the decrease 
and diminution of all your goods, in a miserable way 
all your things shall perish. 


And what you get shall not get away. 

That is, your possessions, your descendants, 
which you hope to save from destruction, will not be 
able to be preserved, since everything will become a 
prey to the Assyrian, and if one will be anxious to 
save something by flight and escape, | will see to it 
that it perishes by the sword. Namely, this is how God 
overthrows the wicked, so that even their name no 
longer remains, as the 37th Psalm [vw 10, 28, 36] 
says. 


V. 16. For one holds the wise Amri. 

He adds this so that we may see that he is 
speaking of the kingdom of Israel, as | also said

under whom the kingdom of Israel first began to

1246 xxvi, 222 f. Interpretations on the prophets. 


1247 


The seventh chapter. 


In the last chapter, he has summarized his entire 
prophecy in a bundle, as it were, by first punishing the 
godless customs of the people and then moving on 
to the kingdom of Christ. But he is driven by a great 
movement for the people, for he thirsts greatly for 
their salvation; with great vehemence he penetrates 
them and does everything to convert them from 
godlessness. He compares himself to a vinedresser 
who goes into his vineyard, which he has planted with 
great diligence, and looks for grapes to eat, but finds 
nothing. This image is taken from Moses and here 
and there also in 1) the other prophets. Thus it is 
written in the Song of Moses, Deut. 5:32: "Their vine 
is of the vine of Sodom, and of the field of Gomorrah; 
their grapes are gall, they have bitter berries" 2c. So 
Is. 5, 7. the people of Israel are called the vineyard of 
the Lord. Therefore, the one who reads wine, or the 
vine dresser, is the prophet who walks among the 
people seeking some good fruit, but finds nothing but 
thorns, that is, a godless people who despise God 
and God's word. | have become like a householder 
who visits his vineyard to look for the fruit of his labor; 
this vineyard had at first given rise to great 
expectations, but | find nothing in it but thorns and 
briars (Isaiah Cap. 5, 2. also said: "| waited for it to

not even find a bunch of grapes that | can eat, much 
less an abundance of grapes from which | could 
press wine.

Could give firstfruits to whom they are due, namely the 
priests 2c. He therefore speaks of the whole vineyard, 
of the crests of the grapes, which seemed to become 
full of grapes, that is, of the whole people; we must not 
understand it only from the remnants, as some want 
fo understand it. 


V. 2. The pious people (sanctus) are gone in this land. 
He himself interprets the simile he used. The 
Scripture calls "holy" (sanctum) the one who is made 
righteous by grace, who has obtained mercy from 
God. Such holy people he contrasts with others, the 
hypocrites and those who pretend to great holiness, 
as if he wanted to say: Although many pretend to the 
name and appearance of holiness, they are godless, 
not holy, as also Hosea says above [Cap. 4, 1. f.]. 
The ranked ones are no longer among the people. 
4) They all lie in wait for blood. 
He explains this by accusing all of them of 
ungodliness, as if he wanted to say: "Love is so 
extinct, no one has any consideration for his neighbor, 
the ferocity (feritas) of one against the other prevails, 
that all are pursuing one another, all are full of hatred 
and envy, all are unloving as Paul says [Rom. 1, 31. 
'disruptive"]. 

Each one chases the other to destroy him (Quisque

1248 XXVI, 223-225. interpretation of Micah (2.), Cap. 


7,3. 4. 1249 





V. 3. and think they do well when they do evil. 


The prophet does not mean that they were so 
blatantly senseless that they said that murder, 
robbery and ungodly violence against their neighbor 
were good, and they approved of this, but he is 
punishing the attitude of the hypocrites. For the 
hypocrites have certain pretensions, certain outward 
good works, which are very evil in the sight of God, 
since they have come forth from an evil and godless 
heart, but at the same time seem to them to be good. 
With these they flatter each other and boast about 
them, while they should be punished because of 
them. So also Christ says on the same opinion [Matth. 
7, 15. "They come to you in sheep's clothing, but 
inwardly they are ravening wolves." And Isaiah says 
Cap. 5, 20: "Woe to those who call evil good and good 
evil, who turn darkness into light and light into 
darkness" 2c., for the hypocrites cannot do otherwise. 


What the prince wills, the judge will speak. 


This can be understood in two ways: first, that it is 
related to what follows, to this opinion: If the prince 
lays out intolerable levies, the judge is immediately 
ready to concede this (est in reddendo), that is, he 
approves of the prince's ungodly extortion. The other 
opinion is: All princes are oppressors, all seek only 
their own, and that with danger and harm to their 
subjects. But the judge est in reddendo, that is, he 
takes gifts, with which bribed he also perverts justice. 
According to each one's greatness, he judges for him 
2c., and so for each one there is a special judgment 
(divisa est sententia). For godless princes and 
preachers cannot do otherwise, they seek only their 
own, not what is the Lord's [Phil.2, 21.]. As the apostle 
Rom. 16, 18. says, they oppress and corrupt the 
people physically and spiritually, which also the 
[tenth] Psalm describes gloriously, which deals with 
the Antichrist. 


The mighty counsel according to their will of courage. 


Our Latin interpreter has translated badly by the 
word desiderium [instead of by 





pravitatem], for the Hebrew word denotes 
punishment and guilt, as when we say in German, 
"He struggles after misfortune," likewise, "He has 
caused a misfortune." For thus by One Word we 
denote both. Guilt and punishment. The same word 
is in the 91st Psalm, v. 3. where we read [in the 
Vulgate]: a verbo aspero. The Hebrew reads: a peste 
pravitatis ["of the noxious pestilence"), that is, of the 
calamity. So here the opinion is: The mighty and rich 
decide and set everything according to their will, 
"cause a misfortune" as it seems good to them 2c. 


And turn it as they will (Et sic perplexam fecerunt eam). 

The Hebrew word means a rope and something 
entangled. So it is written in the 2nd Psalm, v.3: "Let 
us cast away their ropes", and in the 118th Psalm, v. 
27: "Adorn the feast with may." Therefore the opinion 
is: Every man does according to his will what he 
pleases. The people have no regard for God and the 
law, so everything is confused; there is no order in 
public affairs. 2c. 


V. 4. The best of them is like a thorn. 


David also used this simile in his last words [2 
Sam. 23,6.]: And Christ says Matth. 7, 16.: "Can one 
also gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles?" 
And the ram that was to be sacrificed for Isaac hung 
in the thorn hedge, as Genesis [Cap. 22, 13J is 
written. Thus here and there in Scripture the wicked 
are compared to thorns. The meaning is therefore: 
Even the holiest among them, who put on an 
excellent appearance of holiness, are nothing but 
thorns and thorns. They are beautiful in appearance, 
but they bear no fruit. They produce nothing but pricks 
in the conscience with which they wound the people. 


But when the ay of your preachers shall come, 
when you shall be afflicted (Dies speculationis).

1250 k. XXVI, 225-227. interpretations on the prophets. 


Therefore | say valet to you. In vain | try to turn you 
away from ungodliness], in vain | preach, you bear no 
fruit. Therefore, the speculation will come, the day of 
your visitation, because the king of Assyria will come 
to punish the land as it deserves. This is how the 
prophets use the word "speculationis", as Zephaniah 
also used it in Cap. 1:12, speaking in the same way: 
"| will search Jerusalem with lanterns", that is, | will 
search very carefully and look for all the wicked, that 
| may find them, and after | have found them, | will 
destroy them. 


V.5. No one believes his neighbor, no one relies on 
princes. 


| understand this passage in such a way that the 
prophet describes the faithlessness in the people with 
general words, otherwise, if we do not understand it 
in such a way, everything would not stand right in the 
context. As in German we say: "There is no faithful 
man on earth", so here the prophet speaks in the 
same way, as if he wanted to say: The people do not 
believe the princes, not their priests or prophets, 
because they teach wrong things, as he said above. 
And he says this for the sake of humbling the people 
and taking away their vain confidence, and drawing 
them away from the vain promises of the false 
prophets, in which they promised peace and 
tranquility, as he said above, while there was no 
peace, as Jeremiah says. And so | believe that the 
whole passage is proverbial, as if he wanted to say: 
Do not be deceived by the false promises with which 
the false prophets lure you, because even otherwise 
there is no faith and belief among men, but trust in 
God alone, who cannot lie and deceive. 


V. 6: For the son despises the father (facit 
stultitiam contra patrem). 
The Hebrew word means what we say, "to do a 
disgrace." The same infidelity reigns in the world 
today; there is no certainty anywhere, the flesh 
always remains the same; gold and silver is often the 


1251 


Cause for the most bitter hatred between brothers, 
however much they are otherwise connected by the 
closest blood relationship. 


V. 7: But | will look to the Lord. 


Now he passes over to consolation and leaves the 
threats in place. But the prophet speaks in the person 
of all the remnant of the godly, who were also to be 
miserably afflicted for a time and led away into 
captivity, but were later to be made glorious again 
because of the promises made to David. For, as we 
have said above several times, the threatenings are 
to the ungodly, the consolations or promises are to 
the godly. "I will look", that is, | will be careful, | will 
prepare myself to see - for the Hebrew word contains 
all this - that is, although we are thus punished at the 
same time as the ungodly, we still want to have good 
hope that the Lord will deliver us 2c. 


V. 8. Do not rejoice, my enemy, that | am down. 

That is to say, you Babylon, who will boast 
because of my oppression, who will mock me, stop 
boasting because | will boast again; do not think that 
it is completely over me. 


| will come up again. 

| will regain the former strength, and even in the 
meantime, while | will not yet boast, the Lord is my 
salvation when | am in the midst of darkness, that is, 
in tribulations, in miserable captivity. For darkness in 
Scripture means tribulation and times of uncertainty. 
Thus it is said in the Psalm [Ps. 112:4]: 1) "The light 
arises for the pious in the darkness" 2c. 


V. 9. | will bear the Lord's wrath. 


This whole passage is glorious and very full of 
godly heart movements. The wicked in tribulation can 
take the hand of the Lord. 


1) In the Weimarschen in the margin: Ps. 97, 11. but in this 
passage the word teukbras is missing, which is the point here. 


1252 XXVI, 227-229. interpretation of Micah (2.), Cap. 


7, 9-13. 1253 





But the godly confess their sin and patiently bear the 
hand of the Lord, waiting for the certain salvation. 


That | may see my delight in His grace (Ut videam 
justitiam ejus). 

This means that | delight in his righteousness, 
"that | may see my delight in it. The same way of 
speaking has been above. So it is also in the 91st 
Psalm, v. 8: "Thou castest thine eyes to see thy 
pleasure, and behold how it is recompensed unto the 
wicked." Likewise in the 54th Psalm, v. 9: "That mine 
eye should behold the pleasure of mine enemies." 
The same way of speaking is in what follows: 


V. 10. 1) My eyes will see. 


That is, | will delight when | see them because | 
will see what | have wanted. 


That it will then be trampled like dung in the alley. 

For Babylon and that whole kingdom was finally 
disturbed by the king of Persia 2c. as history teaches. 
Thus, by His judgment, God puts to shame the 
wicked, who for a time seem to flourish and reign 
alone, and punishes sin by sin 2c. 


V. 11 At that time your walls will be built. 

This is fulfilled when Cyrus, the king of the 
Persians, after the Babylonians were defeated, made 
it free for the Jews, who were held captive at that 
time, to return to Jerusalem, as the history of Ezra 
tells. And at that time, after they had returned, they 
rebuilt the temple and the ancient remains. 


And God's word (lex) far out. 


The Hebrew word [XX] does not denote the law of 
Moses, but a statute or ordinance. This is how it is 
written in the 2nd Psalm, v. 6. f.: 


1) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 





"| will preach from such a way: Upon my holy 
mountain Zion" 2c. And Proverbs 8:27: "Since he 
composed (lege) the deep with his purpose," that is, 
set measure and order. So here: "And God's word 
shall go forth", (longabitur statutum) that is, the order 
and statute, that yoke of the Assyrians will fall away, 
you will become free, the Assyrian will no longer have 
the right to make decrees over you, because the Lord 
will free you, who will dissolve the girdle of kings, as 
it is said in Job [Cap. 12, 18.], that is, well-ordered 
kingdoms on which the kings rely 2c. 


V. 12: And in that day shall they come unto thee 
from Assyria, and from the strong cities unto thee; from 
the strong cities unto the waters, 2) from sea to sea, 
from mountain to mountain. 


This, | believe, is the most correct reading 
according to the Hebrew. But it is Hebrew idioms, as 
we say: "from one city to another", that is, | will revive 
Jerusalem, | will restore the temple, several peoples 
from different nations will come together there; the 
glory of the temple will be great. For greater glory has 
been given to the later temple than to the first, as we 
said more abundantly above. Thus he comforts the 
godly, that they may give glory to God, that he is true, 
that the Lord will preserve the kingdom of David 
forever, though they suffer captivity for a time. 


V. 13 For the land will be desolate. 


This can be understood in two ways, namely that 
one refers it to the Assyrians. | do not like this 
understanding, but | connect it with the promise in 
this way: Though so great a multitude of nations shall 
come to Jerusalem, your glory shall be great, but in 
the meantime let your captivity be to you, because 
your sins have merited the same. Your land will be 
desolate, but afterward it will be restored.

manuscript, are omitted here. 


1254 L. XXVI, 229-231. interpretations on the prophets. 


1255 





V. 14: But you feed your people. 


| simply refer this to the kingdom of Christ. For he 
describes here the new kingdom, for the sake of 
which everything happens in the old kingdom. We 
have spoken of this kingdom in detail above. "Feed," 
that is, be thou shepherd. 


With your staff. 


That is, with the gospel, with which you will satisfy 
your sheep and make them fat. So he also calls it a 
staff in the 110th Psalm, v. 2. "The LORD will send 
the scepter of thy kingdom out of Zion." 


They both live alone in the forest and in the field (in 
medio Carmeli). 

Feed your people who dwell in the forest in the 
midst of Carmel. This is how the passage is to be 
construed; our Latin Bible has no proper context. He 
remains with the simile of the herd and the shepherd. 
For he compares to a herd (which the shepherds are 
used to lead to pasture) the people of the Jews, who 
are scattered everywhere among the godless 
Gentiles. Those who hope only in God do not cling to 
any human protection, have no leader or protector in 
the world on whom they rely. Take care of them, he 
says, you Lord, you shepherd Christ. Feed them with 
your word and lead them back, and be their guide, for, 
you have promised 2c. "In the midst of Carmel." This 
mountain is greatly praised for its fruitfulness, both in 
the sacred Scriptures and in the writings of the 
Gentiles. But, as it seems, the prophet is completely 
contrary to himself here, since he says that this 
shepherd will feed the flock in the forest, and 
immediately states that it shall be fed in the midst of 
Carmel. Therefore, this contradiction obviously forces 
us to refer all this to the spiritual kingdom, not to the 
bodily or external one. Hence the opinion is: Feed thy 
people in the forest, that is, in the perilousness of the 
world, where they are exposed to the attacks of wild 
beasts, where the devil pursues them at every hour, 
seeking to devour them like a roaring lion, as Peter [1 
Ep. 5, 8.) says. And "in the midst of 


Carmel", that is, in the fullness of the promises of the 
Gospel, by which they are encouraged and made fat. 


Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as of old. 

These [Bashan and Gilead) were in the kingdom 
of Israel, and have never been brought back from 
captivity, nor has all Israel been brought back. 
Therefore, it must be admitted that he is talking about 
spiritual pasture through the word. And by this | have 
been led to interpret all these things of the kingdom 
of Christ through the gospel. 


Vv. 15. 1) | will make them see miracles. 


After the manner of the prophets he changes the 
person. He says that he will perform new miracles, 
as he did when he led them out of the captivity of 
Egypt. This, like the preceding, cannot be 
understood of the new restoration of the external 
kingdom, but is to be understood of the spiritual 
kingdom. 


V. 16: That the Gentiles may see, and all their 
mighty men be ashamed. 

So great will be the course of the gospel and of 
this new kingdom, so far will it extend that it will reach 
even the Gentiles, who will see the miracles of Christ 
and the apostles; they will see such great power of 
the Spirit in them that they will be ashamed, and 
easily desist from trusting in the carnal arm any 
longer. They will no longer boast of their powers, not 
of their carnal righteousness in which they trusted, 
but will boast that they know me, ler. 9, 24. 


And cover their ears. 

That is, they will no longer exalt their 
righteousness. After they have heard the true 
righteousness of Christ, all their own will be impure 
to them. They will only want to hear Christ. 


V. 17, they shall lick dust like serpents, and tremble 
like the worms of the earth in

1257 





their holes; they will fear the LORD our God and be 
terrified of you. 


It is an enormous error in our Latin Bible that it 
reads here: Dominum Deum nostrum non 
desiderabun. But all this is said of the fruit of the word 
preached among the Gentiles, what kind of fruit the 
Gentiles will bear after they have heard the gospel. 
These are images that indicate that the Gentiles will 
humble themselves and think less of themselves 
after they hear the gospel. It is an exceedingly strong 
indication of a humble confession, when after the 
revelation of the gospel we condemn all that is ours, 
[admitting that] there is no righteousness, wisdom, 
powers, and all that the flesh is able to do, when itis 
compared with the glorious and _ delicious 
righteousness of Christ. And this is what he says 
here: "like the worms of the earth they will tremble in 
their holes," that is, they will think very little of 
themselves in comparison with the exceeding great 
glory of Christ, therefore they will go out of their 
hiding-places in dismay and in the greatest haste (as 
worms are wont to flee most quickly from the 
presence of men), that is, out of their righteousness, 
their statutes, on which they relied before, and in 
which they endured, and will rejoice and fear at the 
righteousness of Christ. All that is theirs they will 
regard as nothing, but all that is Christ's they will 
marvel at and receive. 


V. 18" Who forgives sin. 

Not everyone will believe in the gospel, but only 
those who are chosen from eternity. From these you 
will take away the sins, because by their works, their 
righteousness, their ceremonies, they will take away 
the same sins. 


1) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 





cannot take away. No works will be able to save 
them, but this will be their salvation, that you take 
away their sins, since you alone are the true God who 
can take them away. 


Who does not keep his wrath forever. 


He will not hold fast to His anger, but will forgive, 
since it is His good pleasure to have mercy. These 
are exceedingly rich promises and consolations, 
through which the heart can take courage in any 
affliction, no matter how great, since it knows that 
God is a Father of mercy, who does not want the 
sinner to die, but to live, as Ezekiel Cap. 33, 11. who 
wants to forgive sins 2c., as he adds here: 


V. 19.2) And cast all our sins into the depths of the 
sea. 


That is, he will remove them far from us so that 
they can never again trouble our conscience. He will 
give us peace of conscience and a completely free 
conscience, since peace follows the forgiveness of 
sins, where the heart feels the sweetness of divine 
goodness, since sin is forgiven 2c. 


V. 20. You will be faithful to Jacob and gracious to 
Abraham. 


That is, you will fulfill what you promised the 
fathers, namely the blessing and the good news of 
eternal bliss. Thus, Scripture everywhere excludes 
all our merit. That is why God gives grace, that is why 
He forgives sins, that is why He makes us blessed, 
because He has promised it, not because we have 
earned it 2c.

[The first chapter] 


V. 1. To Micah. 


When the disturbance of the Jewish people was 
imminent and a new time was to come, many prophets 
were sent beforehand, who announced the disturbance, 
whether they could not move the people to repentance. 
Among the older ones are 1. Amos, 2. Hosea, 3. Micah. 
They go about prophesying the end of this people and 
the beginning of a new people. They introduce the 
kingdom of the Assyrians [against the kingdom of Judah 
and Israel]; 1) After this came to an end bodily, the 
spiritual followed. Since both Judah and Israel were 
destroyed, the outcome of the gospel gathered some 
from Judah, some from Israel. The people from Judah 
2c. remain small 2c. This is what the prophets have in 
mind. Before a great disturbance, God uses to send an 
extraordinary sermon, a light in advance. Those 
shouted): Promise, promise! eternal, eternal! In 
contrast, the prophets said: You are not righteous 2c. 
This kingdom will not endure, another will come 2c. So 
nowadays the light of the gospel is there; there is a new 
[situation, hurried) change of all things. "He will not 
preach in vain," he will not pour out his word in vain; 
retribution will follow as it did there. This imminent

captivity these prophets Hosea and Micah saw before 
their eyes, at the same time also the final “destruction) 
of Jerusalem by the Romans 2c. God always fulfills his 
words wonderfully. There should always be someone 
who sweetens on David's chair until the hero (Shiloh) 
comes 2c. [Gen. 49:10] The kingdom of Israel does not 
have the eternal promise, but Judah does, as is clear 
from the blessing of Jacob. The kingdom of Judah did 
not fall away completely. In the Babylonian 2) captivity 
Jechaniah remained and was thrown into prison, but not 
killed. By the son of the king of Babylon 3) he was set 
over all the kings that were at Babylon. So Paul says 
[Rom. 11, 1.]: Are all the Jews perishing? No, | am not 
perishing 2c. "The rest will be saved," Rom. 9, 27. So 
they understood [the word 2 Sam. 7, 16. (Gen. 49, 10.): 
Your throne) shall not cease, that is, the throne will 
remain in the land 2c. Therefore, the prophecy of Hosea 
and Micah was not sorry for them 2c. We have not so 
certain a cause of unbelief as they, because we have no 
promise 2c. They boast that the church must be 
preserved, and say that they are the church. This can 
remain even if all the monks and bishops perished;

preached against the divine promise, that is, against the 
false interpretation of the divine promise. Note the 
passage in Jeremiah 1) [Cap. 32, 4. f., where it is 
said],he will see the king of Babylon, and in Ezekiel [Cap.

"Speeches of Isaiah", so here are speeches of Micah. 


Jerusalem. 


That meant touching the ulcer, touching the eye. This 
is nothing else than prophesying against God. It is to be 
wondered at that he lived so long, but he had a godly 
king, Hezekiah or Ezekiah 2c. So said the elders of 
Isaiah and Jeremiah 2c.: We cannot suffer it, GOD is 
with us; we have the miracles, the law 2c. They prophesy 
against the kingdom in which they were 2c. 


V. 2. listen, all peoples, take heed, land, and all that 
is within; for GOD the LORD has to speak to you. 


Adonai is the Lord. - He speaks with a great spirit. He 
has imagined the disturbance with certain faith that he 
does not see 3) how it can be resisted. It is with a great, 
moved and sorrowful spirit that he wants them to know: 
"Let me tell you", something great "is present".

V. 3. For behold, the LORD will go out of his place 
and come down. 


Now follows what he wants to say: Gather yourselves 
together for the descent [of the Lord“f 2c. This is the 
opinion: Do not imagine that God is gracious to you. The

that you might be secure and presumptuous. He hates 
presumption and security; those who fear, He loves 2c. 
- ["He will go out from his place") is a figure of speech 
which means]: He is now hidden, but will soon come; 
now he dwells in a hidden place. - "Descend," that is, 
make himself present by efficacy through the King of the 
Assyrians and Babylonians.

V. 5: All this because of Jacob's transgression (in

Here is his boldness in punishing such great men, the 
priests who kept the law day and night 2c. It is not well 
translated here [by in]. Ps. 17:9: 4) in anima, that is, for 
my soul's sake. Thus here: All this is "for the 
transgression of Jacob," and for the sin of the hemp of 
Israel. They did not want to hear that they were sinners, 
as our [papists] do nowadays, that they should fear the 
wrath of GOD 2c. Therefore they say, "Which is the 
transgression?" This whole priesthood, the whole 
kingdom is ungodly, because it has set up for itself a 
worship of God 2c. "Transgression" is to leave the right 
way and find another, "to become apostate." Here 
"heights" stands for altars. Both kingdoms find, Israel in 
Samaria, Judah in Jerusalem, services and sacrifices are 
set up which GOD has not commanded. [They say,] 
Micah, you are lying. He answers their question.

V. 7. 6) All their idols shall be broken, and all their 
whoredoms shall be burned with fire, and will destroy 
all their images; for they are gathered of whoredoms,

In perditionem, that is, they shall be laid waste. All

harlotry, by harlotry it shall be done. That is, from 
ungodliness [come the goods], | will see to it: "as they 
are won," that they are so "laid up" [are] 2c. The kings of 
the Assyrians are the fornicators 2c. So it will go with our

1264 L. XXVI, 87-89. interpretation of Micah (3.), Cap. 


I, 8-10. 1265 





The rest of this chapter is quite difficult, and we are 
quite incompetent who undertake to interpret the 
prophets without the knowledge of the language, since 
here the knowledge of the language is hardly sufficient. 
| do not know what to say, let us leave it to the diligence 
of others. So far, he has prophesied the destruction of 
the kingdom of Israel, and that all images, wages of 
harlotry, and votive gifts shall be destroyed and become 
wages of harlotry again, and he presents the destruction 
as if it had already happened, and behaves as if he were 
a spectator of the destruction. The verba which follow 
are to be understood in the mode of possibility; in 
Hebrew they are in the indicative futuri. The Hebrew has 
no optative. Thus, "Es mécht einer heulen und weinen," 
about this someone would like to walk along bereft and 
bare. This "being bare" is to be referred to the more 
delectable clothing, as Isa. 20:2 ff: "Remove thy 
sackcloth from off thy loins" and go naked, indicated, as 
the text says, that the kingdom of Egypt was to be bereft. 
Thus the prophets indicated calamity by some gesture. 
It is not necessary to believe that they went naked, but 
he was dressed in some garment after the upper one 
was taken off. Thus we read in the Gospel [Marc. 14, 
52.] of the young man 2c. "| would like to take off my 
clothes" and just walk around as a sign of great sadness, 
to indicate the nakedness that will be in the whole 
country. Likewise: Someone would make a lamentation 
"like the dragons"; this is hidden from me. Gen. 1:21: 
"Great whales," sometimes meaning dragons. He leads 
great beasts. According to the size of the body they emit 
a great roar. It seems to mean: "that one might howl" like 
a large "whale". The ostrich is almost always called "the 
daughter of the ostrich" by the Hebrews. The nature and 
behavior of this bird is known from Job [Cap. 39, 14. ff.]. 
It is a large animal, but its behavior and manner is this: 
when it has laid eggs, it becomes as hard on the young 
as if they were not its, for GOD has deprived it of 
understanding [Job 39, 16. 17.]. 1) 


1) Weimarsche: "slok. 39, 20.*", as well as the Erlangen ones in 
the margin. 





It is God alone who takes care of them. Therefore, just 
as those who are abandoned by their mothers mourn, 
just as those who have no mothers mourn, so | must 
mourn, suffering everything. 


V. 9. for their plague is no counsel (Desperata). 


XXXX, 2) Man in Hebrew, is not actually 
desperatum, "it means a wretched, miserable, 
sorrowful, afflicted being". Ps. 8, 5. translates "man" 
thus: a forgetful one, a sorrowful one, others: a 
despairing one. 3) Therefore | will mourn, because it is a 
very miserable, afflicted plague, because it has come 
even to Judah, even to the gates of Jerusalem. | do not 
think the prophet is speaking of the Babylonian 4) 
captivity, but of the fear that arose from the captivity of 
the neighbor, by which they were seized after the 
Israelites were led into captivity by the Assyrians. Thus, 
if the king of the Turks devastated the nearest cities, this 
plague would terrify all of us in this city, and we would 
fear that he would come tomorrow, so that the proximity 
of the plague 5) terrified. The plague therefore came 
through terror, through fear, not through the thing itself. 
He says of the blow inflicted by the Assyrians on the 
kingdom of Israel, which did not extend to Judah, but 
Judah was carried away by the Babylonian captivity. 
Therefore | understand it from the fear that came upon 
them by the capture of the neighboring cities. They 
thought that now they would also have to succumb. This 
is the reason why | must lament. 


V. 10. Do not proclaim it to Gath, do not let 
yourselves be heard crying.

Interpretations on the prophets. 


1267 





Lachrymis [in the Vulgate] could have 
been omitted. 2 Sam. 1, 20. 1) It is said, when Saul was 
slain, "Tell it not at Gath," lest the strangers rejoice at our 
calamity and blaspheme the Lord. This is imitated by the 
prophets: "Oh, that no one said it," and that one would 
not weep so that it would be heard. 


But go into the mourning chamber and sit in the 
ashes (in domo pulveris). 


If you can conceal it, conceal it, lest the enemies 
rejoice. "He that hath the hurt, let him not look for 
mockery and scorn." The Philistines and the neighboring 
countries rejoiced: Is here GOD who did the miracles in 
Egypt? When does he defend them? "Behind him!" He 
lets them perish. Here we see how powerful their God is! 
These are descriptions of mourning. It is not actually 
pulveris. We have it in the third chapter [v. 19.] of the 
first book of Moses. It is actually the excavated earth so 
called, the "loose earth,” as is that which is cast upon the 
dead as dust (pulvis); for it is dust, not 2) a clod, clumped 
earth. In other places it is translated by "earth." "In the 
house of the earth" means: in the house where dust is 
sprinkled, where earth is sprinkled on the head. | believe 
that all images and flowery speeches are in this chapter. 
As if he wanted to say: Do not sit [publicly], hide ench, 3) 
do not mean publicly. "Creep into a corner," hide in the 


V. 11. You beautiful city must dahiu with all the 
shame. 

"There the torture goes out." (According to the 
Hebrew | read thus:] 4) Transi tibi, habitatio pulchra, 
discooperta ignomini. In his translations, St. 
Hierouymus always translates the proper names into 
generic names; in his interpretations, he does the 
opposite, he leaves the proper names. Therefore, an 
interpreter of the Bible must know the languages. 


The inhabitant (habitatio) of Zaenan will not move out. 
5) 

[Here | translate after the Hebrew:] 6) Planctum 
domus proxima de vobis [accipiet], dum stat ipsa, 
quoniam aegrotat ad bonum etc. - Habitatio, Hebrew 
nv, 7) means a citizen: you inhabitants in this city. He is 
not speaking of the houses, but of those who dwell in the 
city. This the prophet says in a bitter concession and 
moved by pain. This image is also used very frequently 
in Latin. "Go thy way, thou fair and tender city," thou 
glorious kingdom of Samaria, thou beautiful and rich 
kingdom. Not that he bids them go thither, but he 
prophesies that it shall be so. We say: Go in the name 
of the Lord (as he said above [v. 4]: "As wax melts before 
the fire" 2c.), there is no remedy; there is no one who 


cellar, where those who mourn are wont to be. "Eat your} can resist. And not alone, "Go thy way," but thy shame 


own sorrow," lest it become public, lest enemies rejoice. 
That is, [go] to a place where the mourners may hide 
themselves. All this the prophet says twice, as if the 
plague had already happened, now to provoke to 
repentance and to instruct the hard people by these 


tremendous tribulations.

carried and the disgrace averted, but it was not possible. 
"The inhabitant of Zaenan will not go out" seems to me 
to have been spoken by the prophet in imitation. One 
reads in Joshua, Cap. 15, 37th, "Zenan," a city of Judah, 
which the prophet calls "Zaenan" by adding a letter. And 
these are the cities near which the prophet was, as if | 
prophesied of the destruction of the kingdom, and took 
the nearest cities 2c. So he takes the cities that are 
neighboring to his fatherland: "Go thy way, O kingdom 
of Israel. Our city, in which we live, does not go out, they 
say. But it is spoken in imitation. The bishops or the 
mighty and the princes say to me: "You must wait 
lukewarmly", that the Turk or the Assyrian should come 
here, the calamity will not come upon us. He shows that 
he has often suffered this humiliation and mockery. 
Everything is figuratively spoken: Not, not, no, "my 
Zaenau will still go out", [will) do this glicht), as long as 
she can still do something better. 1) Zenan means: 
having abundance. Thus they ridicule the fierce prophet: 
"If now Zenan goes away, we shall see that [it] comes 
true." - Or [one would like to understand it without picture 
in such a way), 2) that it is suspended, [but nevertheless 
fulfilled,) namely by the other, namely the Babylonian 
captivity. 


[For the sake of the suffering of the next house 2c.] 3) 


["From) you" who are now going into Assyrian 
captivity, [the neighboring house will receive suffering,] 
as happens when neighbors are taken captive. - "The 
house," that is the kingdom of Judah, which is 
neighboring. - "Will receive," from terror at the neighbor's 
captivity.-*Which is still unharmed." The kingdom

3) Vulgate: kinnotuna aomns viilna uempivt ex vodis, (MA6 stetit

Judah still stands, which has terror inside. It stands 
because it receives suffering, 5) it is not weakened. 


V. 12. the afflicted city cannot comfort itself, for 
calamity will come from the LORD 2c. 6) 


This can be understood in two ways, either from guilt 
or from punishment. First, from guilt, because it [the 
kingdom of Judah] is weak for good, does not exert itself 
for good. - "Bitterness," in the Hebrew, means 
disobedience. Erbittern means to provoke by 
disobedience, and it deserved to be thus terrified and put 
in fear, and has also been caught. - "Misfortune," 
namely, of punishment, when both are understood of 
punishment. It stands indeed, but cannot be joyful; it 
bears sorrow, mourns and grieves for your sakes, 
because it also fears for itself. And this | like better, that 
he speaks of punishment: it is weak for good, incapable 
of joy and cannot rejoice much, because the calamity 
(that is, the captivity of Israel) has come near to it, "also 
wants to devour itself sheerly". 


V. 13. you city of Lachis, harness runners 


This, too, is spoken out of a bitter and painful 
concession: Span to drive. - "You Lachis." Lyra thinks it 
is Lais or Lesem, 7) which afterwards was called Dan 
[Jos. 19, 47.), but he did not pay attention to the 
orthography. Laish is on the northern border, Lachish 
and the following are cities in the regions of Judah, so 
close to each other (a mile), like with us the villages, on 
the border of the Philistines. And in the midst of these 
cities the prophet had his being and lived there, and 
applied his prophecy to those among whom he dwelt. 
You can see these cities in the 15th chapter [v. 37. 
39.44.] of the book of Joshua. "Tighten the

Chariot on, you must go away." Tumultus stuporis

according to the Hebrew:] Harness the chariot to drive. 
"My Lachis, you are gone, send you, you must also go.” 


For you are the beginning of sin to the daughter of 
Zion, and in you are found the transgressions of Israel. 


These histories are unknown [and are not] in the holy 
scriptures; you have to believe the prophet Micah that 
Lachish in Judah was the beginning to sin for the 
daughter of Zion, that she followed the worship of the 
kingdom of Israel. You are the originator, O Lachis. You 
are situated and glorious in the kingdom of Judah, and 
yet you degenerate from Judah and seize the 
ungodliness of Israel. If thou wilt be the comrade in sin, 
thou shalt also be the comrade, and the first, in captivity; 
for Lachish was the first city taken by the king of Babylon. 
From you they learned the ungodliness that you learned 
from Israel; therefore hitch up the chariot. You are the 
authors of iniquity; you shall be the first in punishment. 
The transgressions of Israel are also found in you," not 
that they were the first to invent them.

the neuter and feminine genders, so it can be said of a 
gift or of a messenger. | like to take it for messengers. 
Again, it is a concession out of bitter pain: "Go," send 
envoys, gifts, seek helpers. (It is said in the Vulgate:) To 
the heir Gath, not simply: to Gath.

The city of Achsib will lack the kings of Israel. 


"Achsib" is the name of a city in the tribe of Judah, 
Jos. 15, 44. 1 Mos. (38, 5.) is said of the woman of Judah 
(in the Vulgate), when she had given birth to Shelah: she 
ceased to give birth; in the Hebrew it is written: "and he 
was at Chesib" (in Achsib). It is a famous city in the 
Scriptures and yet Jerome did not see the city of Achsib 
( but translated: the house of lies).- "Will it be lacking with 
the kings of Israel" (ad fallendum reges Israel), 
understand thus: You Lachish and Israel, who agree with 
their (the kings of Israel) ungodly nature, "go on, you are 
on the right track"; send envoys, gather the Philistines, 
accept the city of Achsib 2) who agree with you. The 
kings of Israel will ally themselves with the Philistines 
through the inhabitants of Lachish and Achsib; but this 
confidence will be a deception to them when the king of 
Assyria has come and smitten them. This is how | take it, 
but it is not enough for me. 


V. 15. | will bring you, Maresa, the right heir. 


Maresa is a city and the fatherland of the prophet. 
This can be understood in two ways; either ironically: | 
will bring you another inheritance, "will give you an heir", 
namely the king of Assyria. "The glory," that is the shame; 
so he speaks ironically. The villages in our regions are 
scarcely so near to each other as in this country are the 
cities. Why does he call an inheritance? It is an image by 
a play on words (allusione), because. 

XXXXX (Maresa) and XXX 3) "means" 
inheritance, "I will make a right Maresa out of you". 
Achsib "he also makes an allusion out of it": the glory 
which Israel has now 4), "the beautiful" glory 2c., the 
captivity, "shall also come to Adullam". Simple and better 
is this: Maresa, you will still exist, but through the blessing 
of God, the Lord sends you an inheritance, namely me, 
so that by my wisdom you may be able to

This is the conclusion. It was a sign of sadness to make 
the head bare. That is, [your descendants,] on whom 
you have

wander away from you. Again, a bitter concession: 
"Only make the plates (blatten) large!" "The eagle" is a 
bird frequently mentioned in Scripture: "And thou shalt 
grow young again, as an eagle" 2c. [Ps. 103, 5.] 
"Mausern auf deutsch" (mauBern on teuschtz). So your 
soul becomes young again 2c., in the Psalm. 


The second chapter. 


In the first chapter one sermon is completed, this chapter 
is another sermon, which may have been preached on 
different days or at different times. And in the first one 
he announced the disturbance because of the ungodly 
hypocrisy: they worshipped images instead of God, 
which is the head of all ungodly being. In this chapter he 
treats the same imprisonment or disturbance because of 
the fruits of ungodliness, such as avarice, robbery, 
violence, Gal. 5, 19. ff. Therefore, this whole chapter is 
about gross and outward sins, which have no beautiful 
appearance, like the first one about apparent holiness. 


V. 1. Woe to those who seek to do harm. 

XXX actually means "toil" (dolorem), and is found in 
this first meaning in the 90th Psalm, the Psalm of Moses, 
v. 10. "When it cometh up, it is eighty years; and when it 
hath been delicious, it hath been toil and labor." There it 
is in its first meaning. After that, in the prophets, in 
figurative or figurative speech, any iniquity is so called, 
because an iniquity plunges both those who do it and 
those who suffer it into toil and labor. Here it is taken 
figuratively, that is, you who are intent on iniquity. He 
wants to say, "You perish with it in your camp." This is a 
paraphrase by which he expresses their thoughts and 
actions, namely, "day and night you deal with it," that is, 
you practice wickedness. He shows their home 


They are intent on doing harm. In the 36th Psalm, v. 5, 
the same expression is: "They seek to do harm in their 
camp." Meditatus est, 1) he made a point of it, sought 
after it, "dealt with it," that is, you have such a good 
intention. The prophet seems to allude to this Psalm 
word or to imitate it, namely: never 2) does it occur to 
them that they want to do good; with constant zeal they 
set themselves to it. To do harm. 


[That they accomplish it early, when it becomes light]. 


"Early" indicates a certain 3) time; that is strange. | 
believe that he is talking about the evil that they commit 
in the court and in the doctrine, how the jurists deal with 
it, that they make laws and change them again, how they 
may become rich and oppress the Annen. So do you. 
Below [Cap. 3, 11.] he says: "Their heads judge for gifts, 
their priests teach for wages, and their prophets 
prophesy for money", [which shows/ "that he means the 
same sin". Early you teach the people and hold 
judgments, but all that you do

teach, you teach in such a way that you profit from the 
word of God and oppress the poor. This is what happens 
when the word is gone, and nothing better can happen. 
Early [you accomplish it/ namely both in teaching and in 
not teaching, by turning everything in such a way that it 
brings you profit. To this all [papal] clergy (clerici) have 
their attention, 1) that they may become rich and live 
deliciously. The courts of the pope judge that he should 
have the fourth part. The doctrine in the chairs, the 
judgments in the spiritual courts [are handled in such a 
way/ that the belly has abundance/ 2c. So 2) it goes with 
those. 


Because they have the power. 


Everything they do, they pretend against God. Even 
though they have the word, they still misuse it, but 
pretend to be God's image. Otherwise, they would not 
believe us if we did it in the name of the devil. We must 
devour the people. 


V. 2: They take for themselves the fields and houses 
they desire. 


Here you see their poetry and costumes. This is how 
they deal with it, how they get rich. Let us only look at our 
examples: after we have taken hold of a little work, so 
that one can speak under the name of the Lord, 
everything amounts to robbery. So they also robbed, not 
by force, but [saying], Here thou hast the law and the 
scriptures. So they told us 2c. that we have to redeem 
souls by doing good [Dan. 4, 24/"That means" to rob. 
Christ says Matth. 23, 14: "You who eat the houses of 
widows" 2c. - XXX, XXX, mean "each one," as one says 
in common life, "One speaks commonly thus." 3) "They 
do violence to every man's house," they set ambushes 
by laws, by doctrines, as things against a man. "It must 
therefore come to pass" that they may rob all and 
become rich. This is also found in Isaiah [Cap. 10, 2/ and 
elsewhere.

You compel yourselves and think; | also compel myself 
and think: | will retaliate, evil [shall befall you/ You will not

will take care that such an evil time shall come that your

"At the same time," that is, in the evil time. [Parabola,] 
that is, a proverb. [Instead of:] cantabitur canticum | will 
read: et plangetur planctus [or] lamentabitur 
lamentatio, [that is:] "HErr GOtt, behold, a time will 
come, [then] | will arrange it, that one shall sing and say 
of you." The enemies will also sing "a song of sorrow." 
What kind of song? Disturbance will be the theme of the’ 
song; the summa and content of the song, namely: we 
are utterly disturbed. 


[It is over, we are estranged. My people's land (pars) 
gets a foreign master). 


[Instead of] pars [it should rather be] Acker [read] Die 
Aecker, die Landereien, die Besitzungen. It is better 
given above in Amos and Hosea by portio. That which is 
allotted in the people to each one, just as each citizen 
has his "theik" from the field. So the people will be caught, 
that the inheritance, which is allotted to my people, has 
been changed, that is, it has another Lord. This is the 
subject. 5)

1276 L. XXVI, 98 f. Interpretation of Micah (3.), Cap. 2, 4-6. 


When will he restore the fields he has taken from 
us? 1) 

Now comes another part of the song. He wants to say 
(Quomodo recedet a me is interpreted once from the 
father ThiglathPilesser, and then from his son so: The 
son Salmanasser will still return), as if he now wanted to 
make a word play 2) with a new word: How will someone 
pull me out so that our fields are divided again? | take as 
an adverb. 3) The prophets express by two verba what 
we express by a verb and an adverb, as Ps. 71, 21: 
Conversus consolatus es me ["and comfort me again"). 
Thus here: Your property has another lord, who will do 
me this favor, that he will free me, that | am pulled out, 
that our fields can be divided up again? That will never 
happen. If it [the song] is so used by the enemies, it is a 
mocking song (parabola), if by the prisoners, it is a 
lament, and | believe that | am not mistaken. Others do 
not follow this opinion. Verses and poems are more 
difficult to understand than prose, because, bound by 
meter and rhythm, they have a different "manner". Thus 
this little song. The theme: "We are deserted", the fields 
have a different owner. It will never happen that the land 
will be given to us again. He is talking about the whole 
disturbance, so it is not to be understood like this: a part 
of the people, and it will happen that the kingdom of Israel 
will perish from the ground up. 


V. 5: Yea, ye shall have no part in the congregation 
of the Lord (in coetu Domini). 

For he has already said that it will be distributed as it 
was distributed in Joshua, where each tribe was 
assigned its place, and that this will no longer happen 
after this disturbance. [Coetus Domini is) the Ge-

you to be completely deprived. 


V. 6. 5) They say not to be baptized; for such 
baptism does not befall us, we will not be so 
disgraced. 


This is a new passage, not belonging to the 
preceding, Ne loquamini loquen- tes [in the Vulgate, | 
translate after the Hebrew by ne stilletis stillam), 6) like 
Burgensis; | like his opinion and interpretation. This 
image is ffrequent) in the prophets. [Joel 3, 23.:) "The 
mountains will ooze." Effundere and stillare are 
frequently used by the prophets. "Traufen" means to 
preach, for rain means to preach. Hence, the prophet 
says this: he accuses those in authority who refuse the 
prophets to preach calamity. We want to preach evil to 
them, says Micah, which they do because of the false 
prophets. And they oppose to us God's majesty and 
goodness, and say, "You shall not deceive." The godless 
preachers say to the authorities: You shall not trumpet, 
that is, you shall not let the prophets preach. The false 
prophets trumpet, so that we, | and others, shall not 
trumpet. Ye shall not trumpet such things concerning 
these (super istos [Vulg.)), that is, concerning us, and 
shame (confusio) shall not take hold of us. [Confusio is 
as much as] ignominia [disgrace]. 7) It can be said 
fauch) in the manner of a threat about the ungodly: We 
advise and warn the new prophets (so the false prophets 
said of the holy prophets), who want to be God's 
prophets, that they should not dream, shall "the devil 
cheat them". They shall not dream, for they oppress us. 
8) "There is no need!" Both views are good. "We shall 
not be put to shame," we are good.

. 7. The house of Jacob comforts itself thus: Do 
you mean 2c. 


Dicit domus [that is, they say in the house of Jacob. 
They boast and this is their glory for which they despise 
us, Isa. 50, 1) 2. Either Isaiah followed Micah or vice 
versa. It seems to me rather that Isaiah followed this 
prophet. 

Do you think the Lord's Spirit is shortened? 

He wants to say: You prophets say that God is angry 
and that he threatens destruction. Has he then cut off his 
spirit and will withhold his mercy in anger? We are his 
people. He wants to protect lins and overcome for us the 
enemy people. So the pope says: Do you think that 
Christ will leave his church and be angry for so many 
centuries? Those had the promises: You shall be God's 
people, the people of ownership 2c. Therefore the 
prophets argued against a revealed text; but they knew 
that not all are Israelites, who are of Israel [Rom. 9, 6.]. 
He resolves these promises with one word. 


[Should he want to do such a thing?] 


(Instead of cogitationes it should rather read) studia 
(that is, he is not at all so minded. 


(It is true, my speeches are kind to the pious.) 

Here the prophet answers and resolves [their 
objections] with One Word. | confess, my spirit has 
promised much, but your ungodliness | do not protect by 
the word. Thus [we say]: Christ does not abandon his 
church. This is true, but he does not protect the ungodly. 
Here you have the strongest proof ground of the ungodly 
and its resolution: May it be my people or another: 
whoever keeps my word and walks (rightly) 2c. 

V. 8. But my people have risen up like an enemy. 2) 
That is, it contends (against me as) against an enemy, 
as if to say: My

2) In our template, the word uav6r8uriu8 is missing here. The text 
reads: ut 6886t w6U8 i. 6. 2c. 





Words are indeed kind to those who do right (or walk), 
but my people behave hostilely against me as is said 
above (v. 1. f.), they "rebel" as if they were enemies’. 
They rob the cloak, ‘take away the skirt with the cloak.’ 
You are robbers; | speak kindly, you rob. This is the fruit 
of ungodliness. 


(To those who walk along so safely.) 
Instead of "surely" the old (Latin translator) has 


simpliciter. That is, they sow strife. Where there is no 
strife, they seek opportunity for strife. In the realm of the 
Pabst we can see how the tyranny of the Officiale, the 
Notarien 2c. And above [v. 2. it was said]: "They do 
violence to every man's house" 2c. Innocent people they 
brought into great harm by their subpoenas. 


V. 9 You drive the wives of my people from their 
dear homes and always take my jewelry (laudem 
meam) from their young children. 


Where we have laudem [in the Vulgate), the Hebrew 
reads "adornment," as one often reads in the second 
Bliche of Moses [Cap. 28 and 39) of the priests who are 


to clothe themselves gloriously and beautifully (induere 


magnificentiam), as translated by the interpreter. [Ps. 
110:3:] "Thy people shall serve thee in glorious 


adornment." Decus is) "an ornament or adornment." The 
former s "adornment") is the better. It seems to me to say 
of the robbery of the priests and other great ones, but 
others interpret it differently. That is, you plague the old 
women and the widows by collecting [debts) in such a 
way that they are forced to sell their houses, in which 
they have their pleasure, and drive them into poverty, 
and my ornaments, which | had procured for the young 
children, "that (they) might be fat and grow," 3) (you have 
taken away, and not spared), but have again plunged 
them into poverty in such a way that they can no longer 
be helped. You have

succeed in finding a completely satisfactory solution for the German 
words. The other manuscripts give no clue.

Because you have done this, receive your reward,

For the sake of their impurity, they must be

And the destruction will be a hard, strong, violent one.

Above in Hosea [Cap. 9, 7.] 1) we had: Scitote virum 


venti, that means ventosum. That is, that | would be a 
windy man, that is, a vain one, who would be moved by 
the wind. It pains him that this is so true, what is in store 
for these so godless people: "Would God" that | were 
false and lying 2c., then | would only preach to you of 
wine and drunkenness. "I will be a liar unto him." "| would 
also preach unto thee" at thy pleasure, and be silent 
from the cross, and (preach) good days and peace, as 
thy false prophets do. 


[That would be a preacher for this people.]

happen, because the Assyrian will come. He who will not 
hear the father must hear the executioner. - In the 
following, the prophet passes from the kingdom of Israel 
to the kingdom of Christ. 


V. 12: But | will gather you, Jacob, completely. 


As | said above, it must be noted in all the prophets 
that when they have said enough about the disturbance 
of the people, they pass on to the future kingdom that 
was expected after that was disturbed. As in the other 
prophets above, these transitions seem inconsistent and 
a little harsh, but we must defer to the way of the 
prophets. This text cannot be interpreted of the return 
from the Babylonian or the Assyrian captivity, but of the 
kingdom of Christ, for it was certain that the kingdom of 
Israel should not be returned, and the people cried out 
because the kingdom of Israel was now desolate. He is 
speaking of Jacob, not Judah, hence he says of the 
whole people to be brought back. If he said of the return 
of Judah, it could have been understood of the return 
from the Babylonian captivity. He therefore speaks of a 
spiritual assembly, he therefore says of the gospel which 
has been sent throughout the whole world. How then 
was it gathered together in its entirety, since only a very 
small part believed? These sayings must always be 
understood of the ministry of the gospel; whoever does 
not heed this, runs into many places. The whole people 
has not been gathered and yet it is gathered. It is the 
same with [Gen. 12:3], "In thee shall all kindreds of the 
earth be blessed." It is another thing for all nations to be 
blessed, and it is another thing for the blessing to be 
received. Though it goes upon all, it is not received [by 
all]; that is, the blessing is scattered upon all nations, but 
few receive it. The assembly is indeed there, that is, the 
sending forth of the gospel extends over all Israel, but 
not all receive this assembly. Therefore, he speaks of the 
ministry of the word; the work is spread over all, "among 
all creatures," as Paul says [Col. 


1282 L. XXVI, 103 f. Interpretations on the Prophets. 


‘ 1283 





1, 23. 1)] says. That is, | will spread the gospel over all, 
both over Judah and over Jacob. The same is what 
follows: 


[And bring the rest of Israel in heaps.] 
The "others" are not only those who are in the country, 
but also those who are in the whole world. 


| will put them together like a herd in a stable, and 
like a flock in their hurdles. 


XXX 2) [in the midst of] the hurdles. Neuchlin says it 
means when the sheep are on the drift, "in the driving 
out." The opinion is clear, so let us not argue what it 
means. Into a sheepfold, into the same pasture. | will give 
them the gospel, and they will drink the same spirit. 


That it should sound of people. 
There will be a roar from the multitude of people. He 
seems to me to add that the Gentiles are to be brought 
to the gospel, that is, so great will be the multitude of 
those gathered to the faith that there will be a roar, as 
there is with a gathering of the people; there will be a very 
great gathering of them. 


V. 13. a breaker shall come up before them, they 
shall break through, and go out to the gate, and their 
king shall go before them, and the LORD before them.

is] to divide, as in the 1st book of Moses [Cap. 38, 29.], 
"Why hast thou for thy sake torn such a rift? And they 
called him Perez." "A specialist maker," that is, a ripper. 
Therefore they will break through and go out and in to the 
Thor. And it is ["breaker through"] a designation of Christ, 
and a beautiful text, namely: who first breaks through and 
makes the way, "a breaker of the way." So it is Christ, he 
calls him. He has made the way, so that one can go 
through the obstacles, as there are the sin, the law, the 
wrath of God. The

means, | will lead them to One sheepfold. Christ says 
[John 10:28], "I give unto them eternal life." But it comes 
to stand tall. Someone must go ahead to make the way. 
The law, sin, the wrath of God and the devil stood in the 
way, and still stand in the way; everything hinders 3) 2c. 
This way is not easy for the flesh. The pasture is sweet, 
but bitter for the flesh. Our righteousness, the world, the 
wicked and our flesh are set against us. Joh. 16, 33. 
[Christ says]: "| have overcome the world", that is, | have 
broken through. "The breaker" will go up before them. 


Pandens iter ["who breaks the way,” in the Vulgate] is 
too weakly spoken. "A fine text." 4) But nothing has stood 
in the way of this, he is the breaker, 5) so that nothing 
stands in the way; therefore they will break through the 
door to life, which was closed by sin, the law, the world. 
They will go out of this world of misery into eternal life. 
Death is the door to life. A beautiful indication of how 
great the power of faith in Christ is: we break through to 
life according to Christ. These words do not indicate a 
temporal kingdom. The King is risen from the dead and 
has gone ahead into glory. Now our leader and head 
always 6) goes before us, that we may overcome death, 
that we may enter into life. This King has no successor, 
as they [the papists] want, but it is A Breaker Through. 
From this text it is clear that Christ is true GOD. For the 
breaker is man, and the king who goes before them is 
also. the Lord, whose name_ is Jehovah 


(tetragrammaton). Thus he indicates that Christ is 
true God and man, and summarizes in short words 
Christ's death, resurrection and everything, Christ's 
innocence and His whole kingdom.

1285 





The third chapter. 


| believe that this chapter is spoken repeatedly, 
because the text that just precedes is given after the 
captivity of the kingdom of Jacob, because it says that it 
should be gathered again. Or if you do not like this, you 
may assume that it was spoken by the prophet while the 
kingdom still existed (but | do not like this); and hold that] 
it should be gathered together again spiritually, and this 
chapter is preached 2c. He punishes only the fruits, 
since these tend to follow ungodly hearts. Also still today 
this punishment would apply. 


V. 1. (And | said, Hear ye 2c., ye ought to be just, 
that know the right). 


Judicium (that is), the right; what "is right". 1) It is 
moral and external things, what is the right and right. 


V. 2.3.2 But you hate what is good and love what is 
bad; you flay their skin and the flesh from their legs. 


Here | see what the prophet is punishing. It is the 
violence: that they peel off the skin 2c. and even more, 
as he says immediately afterwards. It is spoken 
figuratively and poetically. From German: "(They) flay 
one so that [it] hurts one's body and life, right down to 
the ridge, taking even the marrow." It is spoken in a 
violent image against their violence. Take away that with 
which they were to feed their family. It is a description 
that tyranny devours the possessions of the whole 
people, and this is indicated by the word "as in a top" 2c., 
that is, violent. They are images. 


V. 4. Therefore, when you cry out to the Lord, he will 
not hear you, but will hide his face from you 2c. 


1) Instead of the preceding from v. 1. on, our Vorlage has, in 
immediate connection with the preceding paragraph: "Lt <1ixit 
suUioium, furu: non recht ist." Instead of aixit we have assumed aixi 
according to the Vulgate. 

2) These verse numbers are missing in the Weimar. 


This is a threat: you know that this is a very severe 
punishment. That God hides His face is to be angry, the 
opposite is to be favorable. In the fifth book of Moses 
[Cap. 32, 20.] God says: "I will hide My presence from 
them, | will see what will happen to them in the end." And 
again [Ps. 31, 17.], "Let thy face shine," 2c. He hideth his 
face, when he maketh wholly covenant, that they see not, 
neither seek (the Lord). | will pass them among other 
nations. On the other hand, when he looks, he is 
favorable to us or takes care of us. 


V. 5. 3) Thus says the Lord against the prophets. 

This chapter is mainly against the princes, the priests 
and the false prophets. He is very bold to speak against 
such people, and as it happens today, so it happened 
then: the princes, the priests, the bishops are to blame 
that the people are godless, and the prophets and priests 
that the princes are godless. Therefore, the guilt falls on 
the priests and the false prophets. We preach wrath; they 
say: Do not believe these prophets; you are the people 
of property; is the hand of the Lord shortened? as it says 
in the second chapter, v. 7. Thus they act, so that the 
people do not repent, but continue in godlessness, and 
this is what the (right) prophets call "seduction" here. 
What do they do? They keep the people in godlessness 
so that they do not return, and they bite us who speak the 
truth, as they say above Cap. 2:6, "Ye shall not cry out." 
And here he calls it (in the Vulgate) "biting with the teeth," 
that they preach peace (as it is said in Jeremiah (Cap. 6, 
14.)), and yet is not peace. And those true prophets again 
say: calamity! In Jeremiah (Cap. 26, 18.) you see how the 
prophet against Hezekiah 4) ge-

ner is based the same following: siout sst in 3. legum 


1286 


as it is written in the first book of Kings [Cap. 22, 24]. 
God wants the law to be preached. When peace is 
preached, evil comes of it, because the greatest part of 
men is evil; therefore disturbance and unhappiness must 
always be preached. Those, on the other hand, preach 
that it should go well. This is taken from Moses. [How 
would anyone like to say | will have peace when he hears 
these threats and curses [Deut. 28:15 ff]? They preach 
the grace of GOD where there is wrath. This is how our 
monks preached: He who thus keeps his order pleases 
GOtte. One should have said to them thus: You are in 
the highest degree in the wrath of God. But those say: 
You do well, God is favorable to you, if you build altars 
2c. 


But if you don't put anything in their mouths, they 
preach that war must come. 


sAccording to the Vulgate it says: Et si quis non 
dederit in ore eorum quippiam,] sanctificant [super 
eum proelium]. Others: qui non dederit eis lucrum, 
unde vivant, but I read thus: Qui non consenserit [ori 


eorum, sanctificant contra eum proelium]. ') The 
mouth" (08) goes in general to the office of the word. By 


guttur [night] 2) is signified devouring. That is, whoever 
does not agree with their mouth, 3) that is, whoever does 
not preach like them, against him they make war; 4) for 


this is how the prophets use this word [sanctificar € 


is based on a confusion of our prophet with Micah, the son of Jemla, 
1 Kings 22:9, who lived about two hundred years before Micah of 
Maresa. More correctly, the Hallic manuscript offers here: "These 
flatter those, and bite the right prophets with imprecations and curses, 
and preach peace, like that Zedekiah 1 Kings 22:24."

against him they rage. They preach mercy where there 
is wrath; whoever does not do so, they rage against him, 
"he must be the devil and dead" and damned. 


V. 6.5) Therefore your face shall become night, and 
your divination darkness. 


Now comes the punishment: by your preaching of 
peace you will easily deserve to be bundled, so that you 
will no longer be able to prophesy; when the time of 
calamity comes, when it would be necessary to preach, 
you will not be able to do anything. Now you praise and 
see how you stand for it. The time will come when you 
will not be able to see anything, because you will be in 
such great distress that you will not be able to wriggle 
out of it. Then there will be no voice; where will be the 
sermon? It will therefore be night, fog, darkness. You will 
perish with the people. 


V. 7. And the showers shall be put to shame, and 
the diviners to scorn. 


Confundentur, will be ashamed. Videntes, the 
soothsayers, "will stand with shame" because their lie 
will be revealed. Instead of the peace they preached, 
there will be the calamity we preach. Since they will be 
of no use to your people, they will "cover their mouths" 
2c. This is an imitation of what Moses says of a leper in 
the third book, Cap. 13, 45: He shall walk bareheaded 
and "cover his mouth" lest he infect by his breath. It is a 
figurative speech [which we commonly use]: 6) to put the 
finger [on the mouth], that is, to prevent someone from 
speaking to people. It will come to pass that when they 
are put to shame, they will not forbear 7) to speak with 
men; "they will have to shut their mouths." This way of 
speaking has Moses sg, the leper shall cover his mouth,

that is, he should not talk to people. They will not speak 
because of shame, because everyone will see that they 
were deceivers. 


Because there will be no word of God (responsio). 


The existing calamity will judge what they have 
taught and that God does not speak to them. 


V. 8. But | am full of the power and the Spirit of the 
Lord. 


The prophet praises his power here. Even though 
everyone resists, God has given me grace to speak. As 
if someone among us said, "I will speak" without regard 
to any person, be it the devil, and "it shall cost me my 
neck," for"! am full of the power of the Spirit of the LORD, 
and of judgment, and of strength. | am full of "the right" 
because | teach right things, and "the strength" because 
| am not afraid. If | am killed, good; the Spirit of the Lord 
is with me, which teaches me, and which is necessary for 
the prophets. 


That | may denounce Jacob's transgression and 
Israel's sin. 


Let him who is bold do so. It is easy to attack the 
people, but the princes, that is not the work of a man, but 
of the Holy Spirit. This passage shows where the 
prophets got their boldness, and yet they were always in 
danger of death. 


V. 9 Hear this, O heads of the house of Jacob and 
princes of the house of Israel. 


These are punishments that affect life (morales). As 
in the whole chapter, he attacks the princes, the priests 
and the prophets. They were estates. Few in all the 
estates were just and good 2c. Among the prophets there 
was scarcely a man who had the spirit that he should 
have so [punished the sins of the great ones.] 1) These 
are the fruits of ungodliness. This people had princes 
appointed by GOD, priests 2c., and yet they fall 2c.

You who spurn justice and pervert all that is 
upright. 


Judicium, that is, the law, the right, what is ordered 
in Moses; that is an abomination to you, what is upright, 
that is, what is good and pleasing to God, namely, this is 
what [you pervert]. 


V. 10: You who build Zion with blood and Jerusalem 
with iniquity. 

"You build with blood" is a Hebrew expression. In 
Habakkuk 2) [also found in Cap. 2, 12]: "build with 
blood". He wants to say: You build magnificent palaces, 
but with what? You take it from the blood of the poor, 
you enrich yourselves and build houses 2c. This means 
building Jerusalem with blood. How this happened, he 
now interprets: 


V. 11. Their heads judge for gifts (in muneribus). 
The preposition in should have been translated by 


propter [for - sake of] or pro [for]. "There is no right." 
Judges do not judge for the sake of GOD, but for the 
sake of money; he who has money has the right 2c. "This 
is a helsig 3) thing." These three stands are all wrong; 
"how shall this be?" So our ears, too, are itching, at least 
for us to get fat. The prophets are the masters of all other 
teachers; the priests, when they have received the word 
[from the prophets], must tell this to the princes; the 
whole burden is laid upon the prophets. In Isaiah [Cap. 
30, 10.] it is said, Thy prophets shall behold deceit. After 
the prophets were bribed [, and received money] when 
they did not speak the words of GOD, the priests "also 
took money", the princes "also took money". The summa 
is: All follow, 4) from the highest, the avarice. Avarice is 
at the top of their list; this is the most fearful thing among 
the people 2c. And on God they lean, "ver-

let themselves go to the Lord", that is the most serious 
thing of all. We see what kind of people the prophets and 
the preachers of the word had. So also Rom. 2, 17. ff. 
this is the glory of all the godless: We are God's people, 
everything belongs to God, therefore it is impossible that 
misfortune should come upon us; God will not spoil His 
own, that is, there will be peace. Thus our [papists] say: 
GOtt will not abandon the Church 2c. 


V. 12. Therefore Zion will be plowed up like a field 
for your sake, and Jerusalem will become a heap of 
stones. 

"Of the temple" [means in Hebrew] of the house. They 


are images. Because of your nobility, doing evil, you 
boast 





yet, and does not repent. A twofold sin: You sin, and you 
will not repent. "To the heap of stones," that is, so ruined 
that one can plow on it. "Hie stund vorzeiten ein Kloster"; 
this city, that city 2c. "will lie in the dirt". "A cairn" 


(maceria) is such a place on which to plow. 


And the mountain of the temple become a wild 
height. 


There will grow thorns, thistles and grasses as if they 
were forests. Because of the prophecies that seemed 
contrary to this, they surely sinned and engaged in 
avarice. For a time He [God] protected that city, at last 
He laid it waste 2c. 


The fourth chapter. 


We have this prophecy in the same way in Isaiah, Cap 
2. Micah seems to me to be older; Isaiah was hi 
contemporary. | believe that Isaiah took this from Micah 
After the destruction of the kingdom of Israel, he move 
on to the new and eternal kingdom of Christ. Thes 
promises were incredible[, for they proclaime 
contradictory things, as] Zechariah [Cap. 7, 14. and 8, 4 
f.]. Jeremiah is sent [to announce the disturbance to th 
city]. Jeremiah marvels greatly that he should buy th 
field, Jer. 32, 24. f. This is an example that the kingdo 
will remain and yet will not remain. The prophets mus 
prophesy the destruction and the restoration at the sam 
time; this kingdom must last until Christ. The godly he stil 
comforts, the godless "must go away" 2c. God's counsel 
are wonderful. He does both, he comforts the godly an 
threatens the wicked. The kingdom will be devastate 
and the kingdom will be resurrected, not destroyed, bu 
humbled for a time. They did not understand the counsel 
of God, they could not grasp this way, not even Jeremiah 
that he should buy his field. He 


establishes a new kingdom, which will be more glorious. 
To this the prophets go over to show that God is faithful, 
who does not want David's kingdom to be destroyed. 


V. 1.” But in the last days the mountain on which 
the Lord's house stands will surely be higher than all 
the mountains, and will be exalted above the hills. 

The Jews want to refer this to the return from captivity, 
but in my opinion the text does not suffer this because 


the later temple was not [as glorious] as the earlier one 
2c. "The mountain" is Moriah, "it is about the temple."

glorious and more sung about than all the others.

the people shall be more glorious 2c., all so that the 
promise that had happened to David might be kept. After 
the kingdom was destroyed, an exceedingly great 
kingdom arises. God used to act in the fulfillment of the 
promises as if He were lionizing. Thus he acted with the 
tribe of David as if it were nothing; thus he always acts 
with all creatures. This is the work of the Creator, that he 
destroys what is something and makes something out of 
nothing. Reason cannot grasp it and cannot give GOtte 
the honor that he can do what he has promised 2c. 
Therefore, he describes here the very great kingdom of 
Christ, which is in its highest bloom. This kingdom of 
Christ arises out of the scraps of the destroyed kingdom 
2c. The kingdom of Christ is nothing else than walking in 
the name of the Lord, not in building great cities; that is, 
there will be various services 2c. but here it will take 
place that all walk in the name of the Lord 2c. The whole 
essence of this kingdom is: to believe in Christ. The 
prophets include the future resurrection because they 
say, "Forever and ever." Many parables indicate that the 
gospel is revealed in the last times, 1) in the evening [it 
is called] a supper. If we shall walk forever, the kingdom 
also shall be an everlasting one. We must rise again; it 
is a sleep that occurs between time fund eternity] 2c. 


Eternity requires resurrection. Consolabor "is too 
much." 2) He comforts the people with a glorious word of 
promise, but they could not grasp the same. He 
prophesies that they shall be desolated, but after the 
desolation, he says, it shall come to pass that they shall 
be gathered together, and that the people shall be 
greater 2c. Notice, just as the captivity was present, 
Jeremiah was commanded to buy a field. So 3) |

Quae laboraverat [who had labored == "the

vexation to the flesh that God so wonderfully fulfills the 
promises 2c. The words of the promise separate the 
godly from the godless. It is only to be understood of the 
remaining ones that they go limp in one part 2c. Through 
these others he will establish the kingdom, a [great] 
people, that is, the exceedingly strong church of Christ, 
which is invincible against all the power of the world 2c. 
This must be understood of the apostles. 


And the LORD shall be king over them in mount 
Zion from henceforth even for ever. 


Here again you have the future resurrection. Christ, 
true man and God, calls [Marc. 12, 36. f.] this seed 
promised to David "God", therefore it will not be a 
temporal kingdom but an eternal one. And yet it must be

Vv. 8. and thou tower Eder, a stronghold of the 
daughter of Zion 2) 


Here the interpreters diverge, Turris gregis [should 
be read as] proper name ["Thirm Eder"). In the first book 
of Mosi [Cap. 35, 21.] is "Eder", where Jacob erected a 
hut. "Thurm Eder" was a castell, a castle: "And thou, 
castle Eder." Here the temple is not indicated by this 2c. 


These are Jewish poetries. - Nebulosa. | don't know 
where he [the interpreter] took that from, [it means the 
Hebrew word (xxx)] a fortress, a fortification, a protective 


defense, "kennel, castle." [In Hebrew] reads castle (arX). 
Why doesn't he name other castles? | have nothing to 
answer, unless he figuratively calls the whole city of 
Jerusalem the tower of Eder, or so that this kingdom will 
not remain in Jerusalem alone, but: you rule over the 


whole earth. He names a little known (obscurum) place 
in the land, as is evident from the first book of Moses. 
The opinion is therefore that the daughter of Zion, that 
is, the kingdom, will have it as a castle 2c. Thus the 
gospel will have progress and rule wherever only 2) men 
dwell. [Eder refers to] an unknown place. Another 
opinion is: that it is a protective defense of the city of 
Jerusalem 2c. He speaks as to such people who are 
already caught and set captive; so surely the disturbance 
will take place. 


Your golden rose will come, the previous dominion. 


Not only the dominion, but also the kingdom. Just as 
the people were completely free under the Lord before, 
so after the captivity the promise and the comfort is: The 
Lord will be king. He calls the kingdom

V. 9. Why then do you now cling to other friends? 


He speaks all this to make the matter clear. It is 
certain that you shall go into captivity, your sins have 
deserved it. ["Is not the King with you?"] This is full of 
comfort 2c. | tell you, there will be a greater kingdom yet. 
Both counsel, that of threat and that of promise, they [the 
prophets] rightly apply to the people. [The prophet 
upholds the godly so that they do not despair. Why do 
you grieve, "how do you grieve?" Thou thinkest that it is 
come to pass that thou shalt have no king. No! A more 
excellent king and counselor will be given to you. Thus 
the Holy Spirit represents us, for he groans for us with 
inexpressible groanings. These divine works the flesh 
does not grasp, spiritual people hardly grasp them 2c. 
Actually, he is aiming at the heart movement of godly 
people in captivity who want to despair and think, We will 
never have a king [again]. No; you have carnal thoughts 
2c. 


So that the woe has come to you, like one in 
childish distress. 


This is a very appropriate simile [which also] Christ 
uses in the gospel [Joh. 16, 21]. The apostles were very 
distressed because a new offspring was to be brought 
forth. There was despair; they say [Luc. 24, 21.], "We 
hoped he should redeem Israel." The mother "must die," 
there comes the hand of GOD helping to birth. This 
wretched people was brought to despair, "there it was" 
in child trouble with a kingdom. "Hold fast", this very 
captivity and tribulation will give birth to a kingdom. So it 
was with the Roman empire, since Hannibal was victor. 
When he wants to exalt us, he begins to humble us 
greatly. Thus a new divine work is born in anguish and 
pain; you must have sorrow like one in childish distress 
2c.

V. 10. Dear one, suffer such pain, and croak, you 
daughter of Zion. 


This is how we encourage women in need of children: 
"Suffer, hold on. A new kingdom will come out of you, 
just hold on 2c. Suffer and keep strong. The "consolation 
[is, it is] A perseverance," 1) for the most glorious 
kingdom will soon be born, the promised gift, but you 
must first become nothing. This refers to the time when 
a woman labors to bring about childbirth. "It is to be done 
by an hour." The word of promise is necessary, with 
which he keeps us in order and comforts us 2c. 


For you must indeed go out to the city re. 


This is a concession: | confess, you will be taken away, 
"must go out, the" kingdom "must go there". "Out to the 
city", by this understand Jerusalem and all the cities. 
That is, you will not be a ruler and will not have cities 
bound to you; in the field you will be bound to peasant 
labor; you will serve the Assyrians and their princes. This 
Jeremiah [Cap. 25, 11. ff.] further interprets, "And shall 
serve seventy years. "2c. They [the prophets] persuade 
the godly that they should suffer it, "it is not long to do." 
He [God] will lead you back to Jerusalem, and there will 
be the kingdom; and so it is done. 


V.11. For many nations will almost rise up against 
you and say, "She is banished. 


It is nothing that you want to understand here under 
Babylon Rome. Already by the Babylonian captivity 
many Gentiles have been gathered, as your ungodliness 
deserved 2c. The land shall be defiled and desecrated, 
they shall make thee nothing; this is what the heathen 
think. Though the heathen say unto Babylon, They shall 
be made nothing, and serve [ that we may see our 
pleasure in them] 2c. [Ps. 137:7, "Pure off." 


1) In our original: ''trést eyn hart hatten". 





We want to see our desire for Zion. 


Et aspiciat [oculus noster in the Vulgate] is a 
Hebrew idiom. "| have seen my pleasure in it, would have 
liked to have seen it long ago", that it would go to ruin 
completely. Into the hands of the most godless, bitter 
enemies "they had to give themselves, that hurts. Fools 
do not know" what they are doing; their joy will be turned 
into sadness. 


V. 12.2) But they do not know the thoughts of the 
Lord.

do not know, and you [do not know it either]. They do not 
recognize it, they do not understand it. He will gather 
them like hay into a bundle 2c., "make a great heap, that 
it may well strike it." The larger the gathering, the better 
it can be compressed 2c. This can be seen in the Roman 
Empire. [God does this to show that the lowly word of the 
Gospel is more powerful than any kingdom. "[He] 
confidently lets thresh upon it." 


V. 13. 3) Therefore arise and thresh, O daughter of 
Zion. For | will make you horns of iron and claws of

which thou shalt not only overcome, but destroy. In Isaiah 
it says [Cap. 33, 1.]: "Woe to you, you destroyer! Thinkest 
thou that thou shalt not be destroyed?" 2c. 5) These are 
consolations by the future kingdom to those who should 
be led bodily into captivity. 


And you shall smite many nations. 


By the word. And thou shalt give their goods, rapinas 
[in the Vulgate], their possessions [to the LORD].

is, you daughter, who are very practiced in war, who 
[makes] wars on everyone, and attacks, and everywhere 
the weapons clash: against thee also shall war be made 
2c. He will say that the daughter of Zion will thresh, and 
banish thee to the LORD the Ruler, and offer thee for 
sacrifice. Thou also, Babylon, shalt be a part [of the 
spoil], which now art a warrior, mighty in arms; and thou 
that besiegest us shalt be warred against. As thou doest

he comforts the godly who are to be led captive.

The fifth chapter. 


V. 1... And thou Bethlehem Ephrathah, which art 
little. 


So far he has prophesied about the victorious army 
under Christ. Through this victory vengeance will be 
taken on the physical victors 2c. After this victory is 
described, he now describes the prince and the head of 
this victory, where he shall be born. Clearly he 
designates the place, so that for the church in its coming 
into being the place, the person, the time would be 
certain, so that the faith could be established. Therefore 
he describes a visible person, a visible place and the 
time, namely after the Babylonian captivity. This had to 
happen so that it could be said: Here in Bethlehem it 
begins, through this person, at this time. Bethlehem is 
located in Judah. This is a Hebrew way of speaking: 


Among the thousands in Judah. 


This is taken from the fifth book of Moses [Cap. 1, 
15.), which set heads over a thousand 2c. It indicates the 
whole nation of Judah. He describes the place certainly, 
so that one cannot miss. So Christ shall be born in Judah 
and of the tribe of Judah. 


[Out of you shall come to me.) 


Here you see how great a spirit the prophet was 
gifted with. He did not have this from the earlier prophets. 
It takes a great spirit to describe the place with such 
certainty. Among all the prophets, he alone2) indicates 
the place where Christ was to be born. 


[Who is Lord in Israel]. 


He says how God with one word abolishes the 
physical kingdom and puts the spiritual kingdom in its 
place 2c. He says that He will be Lord in Israel, and yet 
He has said before that the

to the Vulgate counting, in the whole remaining chapter only the verse 
numbers "4.", "7." and "10." are found. 

2) Instead of 801nin, the Hallic manuscript should probably read

Kingdom of Judah and Israel should be disturbed, but 
Israel should not be restored because it was in Assyria. 
The duke will come from Judah, but will spread his 
kingdom over Israel. This is obviously spoken of the 
spiritual kingdom of Christ. Before it happened, it was 
not understood. It argues against itself, both in the 
sense and in the words. Thus find the counsels of God 
and the prophecies. Though ye be scattered to the ends 
of the earth, yet Judah shall remain unto me, and that 
there may be a duke in Israel, | will raise up unto me a 
duke 2c. This is spiritual way. 


Which exit has been from the beginning and from 
eternity. 


"From the beginning," namely, of the world or of the 
time of the world, as Titus [Cap. 1, 2.) says: "Before the 


times of the world." He went out from the beginning (ab 


ante), even from the times of the world, since now the 
time of the world began. He does not go out only after 
the captivity, but He has already gone out. Joh. 1, 1.: "In 
the beginning." At the same time as the beginning he did 
not begin, but he was. Since he could not call eiil former 
(ante), because a former was not, therefore he says 
here: "From the beginning", from the times of the world 


(a seculo) you are. [Joh. 8, 58.:) "Before Abraham was, 
| am." The exit can be understood in two ways, either 
from the exit after the accident, or through the birth. If it 
is understood according to the providence, it would be 
as Paul says in the letter to Titus, "Before the times of 
the world." In the Revelation it shits, Cap. 13, 8.: "The 
Lamb slain from the foundation of the world"), and in the 
Epistle to all the Ephesians [Cap. 1, 4.]: "Before the 
foundation of the world was laid. "3) So here: "From the 
beginning", that is, it was determined that this duke 
should go out in this way, so that no one would think that 
Christ would be

opinion and it is true. The other opinion is: He came 
forth, that is, he was born of the Father. To whom this 
pleases, it may please. (Joh. 16, 28.:) "I came forth from 
the Father, and am come into the world" speaks of the 
outward going forth. But the former opinion pleases me, 
that it was determined: He went forth when the world 
was created. 


V. 2. But he lets them plague 2c. 


The text here is dark. After the person of the duke or 
lord is described, now the office of this duke follows, how 
he will rule, with which weapons. It will not be a fleshly 
kingdom as before, but a spiritual one. After the manner 
of the prophets he says, "they" [, without mentioning the 
name), meaning that all understand; as in John [Cap. 20, 
15.], "Lord, hast thou carried him away?" Out of great 
emotion of heart he says, "they," the Jews, the rest of 
the synagogue. 


Until the time that she who is to give birth has given 
birth. 


Until the church was born. Since the apostles were in 
the highest fear, the church was born. When the Church 
was born, everything was fulfilled. With regard to the one 
who gives birth to the fruit (that is the Church), he will 
provide this: 


sThen the rest of his brothers will come back to the 
children of Israel). 


The rest of their brothers will convert to the children 
of Israel and the children of Israel to their brothers 2c. In 
order that he may reign over Israel, that he may establish 
this, it is necessary that this kingdom be bodily 
maintained. "The rest" are the apostles; they are 
converted that they may teach and preach. This 
happened after the ascension of Christ. With this he will 
deal, desiring [that] the hearts of the fathers might be 
(converted) to the children 2c. [Luc. 1, 17.] The apostles 
will be converted, that is, they will be sent and seek the 
brethren through the gospel in all the earth 2c. It is not 
Israel that will return 2c. It will not 





be an [outwardly glorious] kingdom 2c. but a kingdom of 
peace. He will establish it through the word of the gospel, 
which will not be other than despised. Therefore great 
courage is needed. He indicates what the ministry of the 
word must suffer. 


: 3. But he will appear and feed in the power of the 
ord. 


The duke will appear. He will pasture [, that is, he will) 
the word of the gospel [proclaim]; he will give glorious 
victory through the majesty [of the name of God]; he will 
conquer, he will triumph, although the gates of hell rush 
and rage. The cross is connected with the word, and the 
strength of the word is that they [who adhere to the word) 
overcome through death. "These are" the weapons, the 
powers, the splendor of the kingdom of Christ 2c. 


And they will live. 


Et convertentur should [according to the Hebrew 
rather) mean: "And they will dwell." By this One Word he 
sums up the whole security of peace. That is, they will 
be secure in so great a trouble and cross, for the spirit 
of strength is in them, Isa. 11, 2. 1) So it will not be a 
fleshly kingdom, but a spiritual one to the ends of the 
earth 2c. 


V. 4. To this end we will also have peace before 
Asshur, who has now fallen into our land. 


Now he attacks the false prophets. Above [Cap. 3, 5. 
Vulg.] it says: "They bite with their teeth", who say 
peace, and yet is no peace 2c. There will be a true and 
certain peace, "but [you] must [too]suffer a distemper," 
not as you imagine. There will certainly be a kingdom of 
peace, but a spiritual one, but you shall first suffer me 
the opposite of peace; to this you shall first look. You 
have not recognized the way of peace. Before that you 
will have the Assyrian in the land. As if he wanted to say: 
| preach a new kingdom to you; only do not hope that it 
will come while this physical kingdom still exists.

seems to speak foolishly here; if | spoke so, you would 
laugh. He wants to say: we will attack the king of Assyria, 
not with princes, but with shepherds who preach the 


word. Hominum is emphatic: uneducated superiors, not 
exalted (magnates), "delicious people." He is not talking 
about the princes of the earth 2c. A human child (filius 
hominum) is a "common man" and terrigenae [are] 


"great Hanses.” [Primates hominum are] "a rabble, a 
heap" without rulership, lowly people, like shepherds, 
who are also chiefs. He indicates that the least and most 
despised people are to be awakened against the 
Assyrians. These are the apostles, lowly, common 
people, who are like other people. Then [indicates 


primates hominum) in general the person of external 
superiors. He puts a definite number ["seven" and "eight"] 
for an indefinite one. But he indicates that a large country 
is to be converted by a small team and a small number 
2c. It is a Hebrew figure of speech [Eccl. 11, 2.], "divide 
out of 1) among seven and among eight," that is, "give 
always, to and fro" 2c. "The shepherds" are the 
preachers, and the "eight princes" are like the rest of the 
common people.

"With the sword," namely of the Spirit [Eph. 6:17]. This is 
the fruit of this duke.

Assyrians to be defeated again by Judah 2c. through the 
word of the gospel. 


So we will be saved from Assur. 
This is how the liberation from the Assyrians will happen: 
first we must perish before we will be victorious. So also 
Christ is our peace, but we must first be in the cross. 


V. 6. The rest of Jacob will also be among many 
peoples. 

We hear what kind of vengeance it will be against the 
Assyrian kingdom because of the captivity of Israel and 
Judah, namely that Judah will be destroyed physically, 
but the Assyrians will be captured spiritually. Physically 
they will take captive those whom they take captive 
spiritually. He joins the kingdom of Judah and Israel, he 
joins the kingdom of the Assyrians and Babylonians, so 
that we must understand it spiritually. He makes no 
distinction between these two kingdoms, whether it was 
Assyria that took Israel captive or Babylon that did so to 
Judah. He indicates that he is not talking about physical 
kingdoms. By these words: "The rest also" 2c., he 
describes by which power this will happen, namely that 
this vengeance is to be carried out by the children of 
Israel. Again he names both kingdoms with the name 
"Jacob". He describes the ministry and the power of the 
first apostles and the fathers, first what kind of people 
they would be among their people, then among the 
Gentiles. He connects the church of the Jews and the 
Gentiles. - "The rest", the yeast also came together in 
Jerusalem, Apost. This text is intended for the 
Pentecosts, when this prophecy is fulfilled.

1308 D. XxVI, 124-126. interpretation of Micah (3.), cap. 5, 6. 7. 


Like a dew from the Lord. 


That is, they will be sent by the Holy Spirit, not by 
human beings. The thing will be led from above, not by 
human powers. No one knows where and from where 
the dew will come, and yet it descends on the grass and 
fertilizes. Paul says in the first letter to the Corinthians, 
Cap. 3, 9: "You are God's field work" 2c. Thus the gospel 
is a dew and the word sent down from heaven through 
the apostles, and they themselves are called a dew. 


Which waits for no one. 1) 


Quae can be related both to the thau and to the grass, 
or is unrelated. He wants to say: The peoples will be like 
herbs and grass, since one does not wait for the hand of 
the people, which is not cultivated with the hands, as the 
country ducks say: If you have wood [land], make 
meadows from it. These are the best possessions, 
because they yield without cultivation and effort on the 
part of men, as the Psalm [Ps. 72, 16. Vulg.] 2) says, 
"They shall flourish like grass," that is, without human 
labor and effort; Rather, through the Word and the Holy 
Spirit alone, the Gospel makes men in the Holy Spirit to 
bear fruit without being forced. - That is, the Holy Spirit 
and the Word are sufficient to nourish and fertilize 
Christians; human strength is not necessary. This is 
fulfilled on the day of Pentecost and in the following 
days. In Isaiah [Cap. 45, 8.] it says: "Drip, you heavens, 
from above" 2c. Peter's sermon [Apost. 2 was such a

through the word of the Holy Spirit, 2c. 


V. 7. yes, the remnant of Jacob will be among the 
nations of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts 
in the forest, like a young lion among a flock of sheep 
(in gregibus pecorum), which no one can resist when 
it goes through, trampling and tearing (Erit’ ) etc). 


(Instead of) gregibus pecorum [it should read:] 


Schasheerden.-- Interibunt (v. 8.), that is, they will be 
exterminated. - Thus (like the preceding) this is also to 
be understood of the Holy Spirit. The apostles and the 
first fathers, who laid the foundation, were taken from the 
children of Israel, that they should be heirs on the earth, 
according to the promises. These are scattered among 
the Gentiles, that they should found the Church of the 
Gentiles. - "A lion" denotes the power of the Word and 
the power of the Holy Spirit. The lion tramples, robs 2c. 
It is a picture: he fears no one who would oppose him 
2c. This is how the word will be. This has also been 
fulfilled. The power of Rome is nothing against the word; 
it has so torn the kingdoms of the Gentiles 4) that they 
cannot be saved from this robbery. This edge and 
rending of the old man is salutary, that he may be born 
anew. The gospel is compared to the power of the lion, 
the apostles to the lions, as it says above [Cap. 4, 13.]: 
"| will make you horns of iron" 2c.

| will take away the fortified castles, the soothsayers, 
the diarists, those who listen to the cries of the birds, the 
interpreters of signs. 1) He adds this to indicate that he 
is speaking of a spiritual kingdom. He ascribes to the 
apostles an exceeding great power, lest a Jew should 
say according to reason: Will they then be armed? No. 
You will be unarmed and scattered over the whole earth, 
and yet you will accomplish it. You will have no human 
help, and yet you will accomplish it. How does this 
"rhyme?" Therefore, it must be understood spiritually: 
through the gospel we will triumph and rule in the whole 
world. Paul says [1 Cor. 4:11]: "We suffer hunger and 
thirst"; [2 Cor. 6:10] "as those who have nothing) yet 
make many rich" 2c. | will give thee such a mind that thou

They only advise, but do not have the word. We must

Neither do you; it is the LORD who takes vengeance. 
Peter [says of Christ 1 Ep. 2, 23]: "He put vengeance in 
the home of him who judges rightly." "Our GOD will 
avenge" 2c. Here you have described the kingdom of 
Christ with glorious words. The rest serves to punish the 
people because of fleshly vices 2c. He has spoken 
clearly about Christ and his kingdom. Now he returns to 
his ministry, which was to punish them for idolatry. First 
of all he directs his attention to their lives. Good teachers 
first attack the ungodliness of idolatry, teach with good 
doctrines; then good manners are taught rightly. The 
godless teachers do not do this, [who] teach rewards 
and punishments, virtues and vices only so far [as it 
concerns the outward life, without presenting the 
doctrine of godliness of the justification of the heart]. 3) 
Thus Paul first condemns ungodliness, lays the 
foundation of godliness, then he described life. This is 
what the prophet does here.

Judicium, rather a matter of strife. He punishes the 
rich. He is all about punishing their customs and their 
vices, and admonishing them to walk rightly. He is bold, 
for the Lord has commanded him to speak thus. Lead 
the cause against "the hills," chastising, contending, and 
answering against princes and kings. "The hills" are the 
lowly, and the rich, and all that [is] great. 5) His word

epithet [: fortia, that is] "hard", that is, you are hard 2c. 
The LORD will deal with you, it will be scolded, he will 


make a rebuke or a right (argumentationem) with 
Israel. Here he distinguishes his people from the people 
of Israel. It is not necessary to look at the order in the 
prophets; this is how he speaks while the kingdom of 
Israel still existed.

You have always received benefits and repaid evil for 
it. You do such great evil against me, you dishonor me, 
you cause me to get an evil rumor among the nations for 
your sake, as Moses says in his song [Deut. 32:37]. It is 
a great thing that is brought upon them by the 
advancement of benevolence and the accusation of 
ingratitude. You live in the most vicious way. GOD "must 
always be a cover of shame." Nnn he moves up this 
benefaction [of the execution from Egypt] to them; .it is 
always inculcated. The LORD must always be seized by 
some visible sign. Such is the Exodus from Egypt, such 
the Sacrament. It is a disgrace for us, and a very strong 
one, if we have been ungrateful. | have done this and

transforms Pharaoh's power 1) into weakness, Balaam's

filden of Moab. It extends from Moab to the Jordan; it is 
a field. The curse did not come to pass; God preserved 
His people from the curse. This is a description of the 
place where this happened, that the righteousness of 
the LORD might be known, that the righteousness of the 
LORD might be known, and the same might be known. 
This was done so that the righteousness of the Lord 
might be known to you forever, that is, in what way 
someone is righteous before the Lord, Rom. 3:25, 28, so 
that you might know that this is not done by [your] 
strength and works, but by my power 2c. By my blessing 
you will be preserved, not by your works or merits.

V. 6. With what shall | propitiate the Lord? By 
stooping before the high God?’ 


(Quid dignum offeram Domino? in the Vulgate, 
according to the Hebrew, means:] "With what shall | 


reconcile the LORD?" 3) - Curvabo, that is, | will stoop 
before the high GOD, that is, say with what | will 
propitiate the LORD, that | may forestall His wrath. Not 
with your works, not with your righteousness. He 
condemns false righteousness and false worship, as if 
to say, Not with those things in which you rely. The 


whole pretense (larvam) of outward worship he rejects. 
"By stooping, pressing, thinkest thou that GOD can be 
deceived thereby?" Not by such hypocrisy. Thus the 
priests will teach, thus the princes will do, thus the 
foolish people will imitate. This is also how we have set 
up processions 2c. 


3) These words: "<mo prnsvsQiain Vominuiri." are added to the 
previous paragraph in the Weimar one with a preceding comma, in 
the Erlangen one without punctuation mark. Both editions have failed 
to recognize that these words belong to the sixth verse as an 
explanation of the Vulgate. In the Zwickau manuscript, it also often 
happens that only the explanatory words are written down, without 
the words that are explained. That the Weimar edition has made this 
mistake is very surprising, because on the same page in the Hall 
manuscript is found: tzula, Wobr. Huo prasvoniaru voruiunru them.

V. 7 [Do you think the Lord is pleased with many 
thousands of rams?] 


[Instead of] placari it should rather read.] "to be well 
pleased"; as you consider it. See how it stood in this 
kingdom 2c. If the sacrifice of rams did not please Him, 
much less our serried works 2c. because they are done 
with confidence in it and in carnal righteousness. God is 


not reconciled by this glissistic pretense (larvis). 


Or shall | give my first son for my transgression? 


He is talking about the service of Moloch. In the book 
of Kings [2 Kings 16:3 (?)]: 1) He sacrificed his firstborn 
on the wall 2c. An anger arose in Israel, that is, it 
became so indignant 2c. This nonsensical nature was 
common among the Jews, that they sacrificed their 
children. They wanted to follow Abraham, but did so by 
their own power 2c. This is an excellent text against 
righteousness from such outward worship 2c. 


V. 8. Itis told you, 2) man, what is good. 


Namely, it is absolutely the office of the prophets that 
they not only punish the gross evil customs and vices, 
but also hypocrisy. Ps. 51, 8: "You have a desire for 
truth" 2c. God demands the truly righteous, the truly 
holy, and hates the hypocrites fiercely. So here he calls 
the people back to true and right morals and godliness. 
He says three things here: 


[Keeping God's word (facere judicium), and 

Pee ne love (diligere misericordiam), and being 

umble before your God (t sollicitum ambulare cum 
Deo tuo).] 


First, he deals here with the outward life in which men 
prove themselves unrighteous, and finally 3) he attaches 
that which relates to GOD, as GOD ver-

IrMioabo, which is to be read according to the Vulgate. This is not a

be honored, as Christ says [Matth. 22, 21.]: "Pray for 
what is God's" 2c. So it is said [Matth. 5, 24]: "Be 


reconciled to your brother first" 2c. Facere judicium, 
"do as is right," includes that | hurt no one. First, that | 
give to each one what is his, and leave to him what is 
his, his honor, his goods and chattels 2c., that | be not 
burdensome to anyone; then that peace be taken care 
of as much as is in me 2c., as the 140th Psalm, v. 13, 
says: "I know that the Lord will do the cause of the 
wretched and the right of the poor," so that the wicked 
may be kept in check, and the good may be protected, 
that no one may be wronged 2c. This is said both to the 
people and to the judges, that they should make every 
effort to keep peace and tranquility, so that no one is 
hurt. The priests should not teach and write this, but it 
must be fulfilled with action, therefore he says: "keep"

includes killing. | must have a tongue that does not lie 
and deceive. One must hold [one's tongue] in check 


(cohibeat) 2c. | must not desire to harm [the next 
person's] servants, his goods 2c., | must see to it that 
another does not harm either 2c. Whoever does so will 
incur the hatred of many people. It is a great thing to 
oppose those who injure and not to injure. One loses 
favor and possessions over it. | put my whole life in 
danger. To oppose completely all those who do 
violence, that is, to bear hatred and danger in the world. 
This is a great work; the flesh does not do it. - Secondly, 


"that you practice love" (ut diligas misericordiam). 4) 
In very evident words, "that he may delight in doing 
good,” that mercy may delight him, namely, the mercy 
that is shown. [Hos. 6, 6.:] "I delight in love 


(misericordiam volo) and not in sacrifice." In doing 
works, God does not demand anything from us; He 
wants them to be shown to the neighbor. He is satisfied 
with the honor and praise that follow faith, namely, that 
we are justified by grace alone:

that we preach the gospel and offer Christ as a sacrifice, 
that is, preach Christ who was crucified for us 2c. The 
first work is that we keep God's word, then that we 
practice charity and love 2c. [2 Cor. 9:7: "God loves a 
cheerful giver." [Such a one] sees to it that others also 
become benevolent and_ charitable. "Love" 


(misericordia) is passive, which another receives from 


us. - "And be humble (sollicitum) before thy God." The 
order is fixed: first, we are justified by faith; second, we 
give thanks; third, we do good to our neighbor. So he is 
talking here about the outward life 2c. The third part is 
the warning not to be puffed up or presumptuous. He is 
not directing service against God; he has presupposed 
it to be before good works. See that you do not seek 
glory in good works, which he wants to prevent by this 
third piece 2c. Vain glory soon follows; | please myself 
2c. In such a manner shalt thou live godly, so shalt thou 
do good to thy neighbor, that thou abide in humility. In 
the books of Kings 

[1 Sam. 15, 17.] it says of Saul: "Since you were small 
in your eyes" 2c. The first two pieces he had, the third 
he lost. He was puffed up and presumptuous 2c. This 
arrogance spoils all works. It is a well-known saying that 
when an onion has been cut 1) and peeled, there is 
always one peel hidden under the other in it. It is an 
indomitable 2) vice of which the holy fathers have quite 
rightly said]: A thistle head always stands [upright 
wherever it is thrown]. 3) Augustine also makes such a 
complaint. Therefore he [God] makes the saints fall 2c., 
[as the] David, so that they would have this constantly 
before their eyes, and be humbled by the appearance of 
weakness and not be puffed up by the greatness of 
goods 2c. In Proverbs [Cap. 11, 2.] this word [xxx] also 
stands, and no more. Another interpreter has translated 
it: a-.

It is: oppressed and looking for a corner, so that it is 
hidden, so that it struggles with self-love, with vain honor. 
4) A hasty, simple eye is one that is full of the spirit and 
strives to do good to all. "When you give alms", Matth. 6, 
3. hide the alms in the "bosom of the poor 5) 2c. Those 
who have to preside and teach "belong to good people. 
This beast does not let up. Confess that it is entirely so, 
because the hand of the Lord does not come to help 2c. 
He [God] lets them reign, so that He may rebuke us 2c. 
Nothing is to be done, but that we command ourselves 
to the hand of God. This is what God wants, that you be 
full of faith and do good to your neighbor, and be free 
from boasting in these things, so that you may humble 
yourself. If you put God out of your sight, then your 


confidence (fides [?]) and your good works will make 


you puffed up. This is the Christian life, as far as the 
outward customs are concerned. 


V. 9 The voice of the LORD shall call upon the city: 
but he that feareth thy name shall prosper. 


This is a new section. The prophets have not always 
spoken the same thing; they have distributed it to different 
times and oerters. ["He who] fears your name [will 


succeed." "To whom [Salus erit (XXXXX)], "it goeth 
speedily," who accomplishes happily that which is before 
hands. In Job [Cap. 6, 13.] it is said, "It will go nowhere" 
[XXXX] 2c. Proverbs 8:14: ["Mine is both counsel and 
action," or wisdom; it is the Lord who preaches, it is not 
|; his is the voice in my mouth. As if he wanted to say the 
opposite: Those who do not fear him will be completely 
miserable. Bliss will be with those who fear him. 
Unhappiness will be with those who do not fear him.

V. 10." [Still remains unrighteous good (ignis) in the 
house of the wicked, and the hostile low epha.] 


[Et mensura minor irae plena means according to 


the Hebrew:] and the too small bushel, which brings 
wrath. He punishes the vice of not keeping God's word, 


much less practicing love. To keep God's word (facere 


judicium), that is, not to violate, and to hinder him who 
violates 2c. No matter how much is called through the 
cities, no fruit is obtained because many persist in their 
ungodliness. 


"Fire" (ignem), | believe, denotes vengeance. Putting 
fire to a house is a punishment of sin. [So he calls] the 
treasures’ obtained by ungodliness; that is the fire which 
shall consume them 2c. "You wrestle after misfortune, 
have misfortune in Hans." This is said of the ungodly, 
who gather all things, rightly and wrongly. Thither they 
labor that they may be consumed. The unrighteous good 
will become to them a disturbance and a consuming fire. 
"And the little ephah." Nor do | see 2c. with what 
measure they shorten the poor and enrich themselves. 
This [little ephah] is nothing but wrath, namely, God's 
wrath. Nor is there fire, namely [unjust] treasure, in the 
house of the wicked; nor is there wrath, namely the little

The seventh chapter. 


In this last chapter, the prophet concludes his entire 
prophecy in general by punishing the perverse and 
godless customs. He proclaims the captivity and the 
future salvation. He is anxious for the people. He 
anxiously does everything to convert the people to the 
good, as a faithful shepherd is wont to do. He compares 
himself to a vine dresser or to the one who visits the 
vineyard and gathers the remains, and still does not find 
what he desires. This passage is taken from Moses, and 
so in other passages, Isa. 5, 7. The gatherer or vineyard 
keeper is the prophet who goes through the people 2c. 
and finds nothing but the wicked. 


V. 1. 4) [Oh, | am like one who slackens in the 
vineyard, where no grapes are found.

a husbandman and a father of a family who visits his 
vineyard and wants fruit 2c. Notice what is said about 
the cursed fig tree [Matth. 21, 18. ff.] 2c. Quite similarly 
itis said in Isaiah, Cap. 5, 2: | thought | would find berries 
and grapes 2c. but | have been deceived 2c. "Would that 
there were a good man among them!" So much is 
missing, that so many berries would be there, that | 
could squeeze a grape. | desire the firstfruits, that is, | 
have not found so much that | could give the firstfruits to 
the priests; hardly do | find that | can eat myself. He 
understands combs that are full of berries 2c. This is not 
to be understood of the supernumeraries: he finds 
absolutely nothing but combs of grapes and leaves 
without grapes 2c. 


V. 2. [The pious people (sanctus) are gone in this 
land.] 


They are expressive words. "Holy" (Sanctus) is he 
who has obtained mercy. He opposes truth to hypocrisy; 
[he means one who is] holy before God and righteous in 
his walk 2c. Thus love is extinguished, that each seeks 
his own, and cares not that his brother perish. They are 
full of hatred and envy, which takes place where love is 
not. Each one seeks to drive his brother out of his own 
property. 


Each one chases the other to destroy him. 1) 


Mortem, that is, that he banish him (anathema); [this 
happens when] something is made nothing, and 
irretrievably. The banished was not loosed, Deut. 27, 28. 
f. That is, never shall it rise again or flourish again. He 
does not find the firstfruits, that is, true saints, but 
hypocrites. He did not want them. 


V. 3. and think they do well when they do evil. 

Not that they were so extraordinarily foolish that they 
would have considered the robbery something sacred

hypocrites. That is, according to the truth they are not 
holy, but they are

have the ambition [ to appear holy, they pretend], 2) 
which is absolutely not according to the truth. Ju that of 
which they most boast, they are most to be blamed 2c. 
[Matth. 7, 18.:] "They come in sheep's clothing" 2c. In 
Isaiah [Cap. 5, 20.] it says: "They turn light into 
darkness" 2c. That, in which God has the most 
abomination, that they praise the most. 


What the prince wills, the judge will speak. 


The prince demands, and the judge adheres to him in 


his decisions (adhaeret in reddendo), he collects the 
new taxes 2c. Another sense is this: the prince, any one 
who is among them, is a promoter, a distresser; they do 
not serve the commonwealth, they do not protect the 
good 2c. But the judge est in reddendo, that is, he takes 


gifts. The princes are wolves, the judges unjust, because 
they judge according to what is given to them; they look 
to gifts. The judge is after gifts, that is, if you give him, 
he will give you justice; if you do not give him, he will not 
give you justice. See the tenth Psalm, which is about the 
Antichrist. 


[The mighty counsel according to their will of 
courage.] 

The great ones order what they want, they do not 
benefit the people 2c.; they corrupt the people spiritually 
and physically. 


[And spin it any way they want.] 


[Et conturbaverunt or] perplexem fecerunt, [they 
have it] "gewirret in each other". So it is written in the 2nd 
Psalm, v. 3 [: "Let us cast away their cords"], and 
elsewhere [Ps. 118, 27.]: in condensis. 3) This people 
is completely without order and law, they do what they 
want. The people are without law, the princes without 
fear 2c. A proverb:

of thorns, and figs of thistles?"] Isaiah [Cap. 7, 24.] says: 
The land is full of thorns. The ram [Gen. 22, 13.] hung in 
the thorn hedge. The wicked are everywhere compared 
to thorns. The hypocrites and the wicked are like thorns; 
the good, if there are any, are thorns. There are only 
leaves, that is, words, but no fruits with the hypocrites. 
He admits that in appearance there are good, but in 
reality there is no good 2c. 


But when the day of your preachers shall come,

search out the wicked in the land, | will find them and

Desiderium above [v. 3.] should be pravitatem,

"you struggle for misfortune, you need disgrace." | will 
include guilt and punishment. Elsewhere it says [1 Kings 
21, 21.]: | will bring misfortune upon them, "calamity and 
shame." In the Psalm [Ps. 91, 3.] it says: et a verbo 


aspero ["from the harmful pestilence" (XXXX XXX)] that 
is, from an unfortunate thing, from "misfortune." So it is 
here: as it pleases him, "he causes misfortune" 2c. 


V. 5. 6. SNo one believes his neighbor, no one relies 
on princes; keep the door of your mouth from the one 
who sleeps in your arms. For the son despises the 
father, the daughter sets herself against the mother, 
the cord is again the sister, and man's enemies are his 
own household. 

Christ refers to this passage [Matth. 10, 21. 35. f.]. | 
understand this passage in this way: with viable and 
proverbial words he describes the faithlessness in the 
people, as we say: "There is no more faithfulness on 
earth." He wants to cause the people to believe neither 
the princes nor the priests 2c. So Christ also cites it ina 
proverbial way 2c. 

1) This is how it should be read here, not what our original offers. 


The interpretation here reaches back into the third verse; but there it 
is not found. 





This is the way of the world; do not be deceived by the 
false promises of the godless priests and princes 2c. 
Trust in God and His word 2c. 

["Keep the door of thy mouth",] that is, shut thy mouth, 
that is, do not believe her. - ["She who sleeps in your 
arms," that is] a circumlocution for the wife. For so it is 
written in the world, that the son doeth a foolishness, 
"doeth a shame, foolishness, mischief." In Act 2c. We 
see this today among brothers for the sake of gold, 
avarice, advantage, money. Because of money all act 
exceedingly wickedly. Much less can you hope for 
princes and lords, for priests, if father and son 2c. Now 
he moves on to the consolations, after having 
proclaimed the misfortune and the punishment. The 
threat is directed against the wicked, the consolation to 
the godly. 


V. 7. But | will look to the Lord, and expect the God 
of my salvation; my God will hear me. 

He speaks in the person of all the godly who would 
like to help for the best, but are unable to do so because 
the wicked oppress them among whom they dwell. In

says this so that the longing for Jerusalem would remain 


with them. Lex is not the law of Moses, but a statute,

1886. 


Translated from Latin. 


Preface on the Prophet Nahum, 


and what the same is about. 


To this prophecy also the name of the prophet 
agrees. For Nahum in Hebrew means a comforter or a 
comforted one. In this prophecy he does justice to this 
name in all respects. For in it there is nothing but comfort 
for the rest of the people of Judah, who had been saved 
from the destruction of Israel. For above in the preceding 
prophets we have seen the disturbance of all Israel, and 
Israel has been so miserably afflicted and oppressed 
and led away captive that it has never been brought back 
again. Also Jonah, as we have seen above, is sent as a 
prophet to the Assyrian kingdom. 


to reproach the Assyrians for their ungodliness; and the 
matter turned out happily. For by his preaching he 
brought the whole kingdom of the Assyrians to 
repentance, which the Lord would otherwise have 
destroyed if they had not repented, as we have 
abundantly discussed above in Jonah. Since they 
repented, the punishment was postponed. But, as the 
hearts of men siud: when the punishment ceased, so 
also the repentance ceased. They fell back into the 
same ungodliness they had suffered from before. For it 
is impossible that men, when they are well, should not 
behave more wantonly than is right, since they are

LI.D.XXV. On June 13 had been Luther's wedding. After the completion of the lectures on Micah (ain April 7, 1525) there had been a longer 
break. Because of the peasants’ revolt, he went to Thuringia and preached there in many places to establish peace and quiet, established a 
school in Eisleben, wrote there his book: "Ermahnung zum Frieden auf die zwdlf Artikel der Bauerschaft in Schwaben" ("Admonition to Peace 
on the Twelve Articles of the Peasantry in Swabia") and was sent from there to the dying Chur- 


1334 L. XXVII, 62 f. Interpretations "On" the Prophets. W. VI, 3041-3043. 


The kingdom of the world has not been able to make 
modest use of prosperity, which, by the way, as the latter 
has said, touches the hearts of the wise. And this has 
been the ruin of all the empires, that they have not used 
the wealth modestly. Thus the Assyrians have perished; 
thus the Persians by the Greeks, the Greeks by the 
Romans, the Romans by the Goths. And today the pope 
is killed by the word of God. This has also been seen by 
sensible people, who otherwise were far from godliness, 
because they said: What is great does not stand for long. 
For it is not possible that the hearts of men, when it is 
well with them, should keep themselves in their bounds, 
and not be puffed up. The same thing, as | have said, 
happened to the Ninevites, since they returned to their 
old ways through riches that came to them and happy 
success in their affairs, however much they were taught 
better by Jonah. And therefore they also threatened 
Judah with the lower ferment, as before they had led 
away all Israel miserably captive, and had the 
confidence that they could do it easily. For the people of 
Judah were small and weak, the smallest part of the 


1335 


would easily devour the small number. And for this 
purpose the prophet Nahum and the one who followed 
Nahum were sent to comfort and encourage these small 
and weak remnants of God's people and the lowest 
yeast of the people, so that they would not despair when 
the Assyrians attacked them, but would believe that God 
would see to it that they were preserved. 

Therefore, in sum, this prophet deals with keeping 
Judah, which was still left from the exceedingly great 
disturbance, in faith against God, to make the hearts 
quite firm and certain that this kingdom would remain in 
the word and service of God, that the promises of God 
would have to be fulfilled, and that it would not cease but 
last until the coming of Christ, who was to be born out of 
Judah, as the prophecies indicate. And so there is 
nothing else in the prophet but the teaching of faith. For 
he teaches us to trust in God, and most of all, when we 
despair of all human help, human powers and advice, 
may the Lord help his own, protect his own against all 
attacks of the enemy, however powerful they may be 2c. 
But here faith is needed that believes this 2c.

When Luther arrived in Wittenberg on May 6, the prince had already passed away (on May 5). His body was brought from Lochau to 
Wittenberg, and on May 9 and 10 Luther preached at his funeral in the collegiate church. At the same time he wrote his second book: "Wider 
die mérderischen und rauberischen Rotten der Bauern. Around the same time, Carlstadt, Luther's enemy, was kept hidden by Luther in his 
house (See St. Louis Edition, Vol. XX, Introduction, p. 24 sf.). The ftonio inissr in Luther's letters to Johann Brismann, dated July 3, 1525, is 
Carlstadt (the letter in De Wette, vol. Ill, p. 21 f., is not to be dated post n866N8ioni8,'but 1. kor. po8t vi8itntioni8 sXInrinos, as ibick. Vol. VI, 
p. 481 is noted, but Seidemann errs in understanding Cellarius by this. De Wette himself says vol. Ill, p. 21, it is Carlstadt the Woiuo un86r). 
Our writing is found in the Latin Wittenberg edition (1552), torn IV, col. 613; according to the Altenburg manuscript in the Erlanger, oxe*. 
oxx., torn. XXVII, -p. 59, and in the Weimar, vol. XIII, p. 371. The Jeuaische edition did not include the same, perhaps because doubts were 
entertained as to whether this writing was to be attributed to Luther, perhaps merely because it was not overlooked and acknowledged by 
Luther himself; but for the fact that the interpretation itself is to be attributed to Luther, the three manuscripts which have come down to us, 
the Zwickauer, the Altenburger, and the Hallische, vouch. The Wittenberg edition and the Altenburg manuscript are based on the same 
original, for both, with the exception of a few variants, agree word for word. The Altenburg manuscript was not available to the Wittenberg 
edition, but probably the manuscript that had come to Veit Dietrich from the printer of Joel, Amos and Obadiah, Joh. Albert in Strasbourg, 
from which Dietrich produced the Altenburg manuscript. For even the additions and extensions made in the text of the Altenburg manuscript 
have not been transferred to the Wittenberg edition. Incidentally, the deviations of both redactions from each other are extremely small. For 
example, on the first two pages of Nahum in the Weimar edition (which account for about four "columne" in our edition) there are only two 
variants that are of concern, namely alioyui instead of uliyui and pr688i instead of proko88i. In both cases, the reading of the Altenburg 
manuscript deserves preference. We therefore reproduce the text according to the Weimar edition. According to the Wittenberg edition, the 
writing was translated into German in 1555 by Stephan Agricola and is found in the Wittenberg edition (1556), vol. VIII, p. 529; in the 
Altenburg, vol. VII, p. 662 with the incorrect date 1541 (which Seckendorf, who always used this edition, repeats, Hi8t. l.utu., Ub. Ill, 80et. 
XXIV, 8 X6Il); in the Leipziger, vol. VIII, p. 448 and in Walch, vol. VI, 3040. The old translation, although good on the whole, is nevertheless 
defective and arbitrary in many respects, and therefore no longer sufficient for our time; therefore we have translated it anew. 


1336 L. XXVII, 63-65. interpretation of Nahum (1.), cap. 


1, 1.2. W. VI, 3043-3047. 1337 


[The first chapter. | 


V. 1. This is the burden over Nineveh, and the book 
of the prophecy of Nahum of Elkos. 


| like the opinion of Jerome, because he says that 
Elkos is the name of a village, the fatherland of Nahum. 
And so, as Micah was of Maresa, so Nahum was of 
Elkos. 

But he begins his prophecy with a glorious word of 
consolation, saying, "This is the burden upon Nineveh," 
as if to say, The burden with which you have been 
oppressed hitherto shall be lifted from you; you shall be 
delivered, and so much is lacking in it that you should 
perish, or, having been oppressed, fall, that the 
Ninevites, whom you feared before and still fear, shall 
be subdued. For it is a Hebrew way of speaking, since it 
is said [in the Vulgate], The burden of Nineveh, where in 


Latin we say thus, de onere super Nineveh [of the 
burden over Niuive]. But it was Nineveh, as we also 
noted in Jonah, that was the capital of the kingdom of 
the Assyrians. The Latins called it the Beautiful 


(speciosam). 


V. 2. The Lord is a zealous God and an avenger. 


With many words he emphasizes the anger of the 
divine majesty against the enemies of his people, and 
certainly, if we look at the matter thoroughly, the words 
are very heated. The people in the kingdom of Judah 
were small and feared the captivity that had befallen 
their brethren in Israel. The Assyrians were defiant, 
relying on their power and wealth, boasting and thinking 
that they could easily swallow up such a small and weak 
people, as the blasphemies of Rabshakeh Isa. 36:4 ff. 
well indicate [vv. 8 ff]: "Well, then, take it up with my lord 
the king of Assyria; | will give thee two thousand horses; 
let it be seen whether thou canst bring forth those that 
ride upon them. How wilt thou then abide before a 
captain, the least of the servants of one my lord?" 2c. [V. 
15. 18.] Let Hezekiah. 





deceive you not, for he cannot save you. [V. 10: "Yea, 
the LORD said unto me, Send up into this land, and 
destroy it" 2c. Against all this, however much the 
Assyrians may defy and seem certain of victory, Nahum 
fortifies the hearts of Judah, that they fear not, however 
mighty they may be: the LORD would take vengeance 
on the enemies of his people, but they should be 
preserved, as the LORD had promised to David and to 
the fathers. This sermon seemed to the Assyrians 
extremely foolish and quite inconsistent. And no doubt 
there were also people in the land of Judah who 
believed that nothing less would happen than what 
Nahum prophesied here. For since the danger was 
already imminent, since the Assyrian was already 
making havoc with a very powerful army, he called them 
safe and promised them salvation; the Lord would fight 
for them, he would be an avenger against his enemies. 
It took a very great faith to grasp these divine promises 
and to expect the future vengeance of the Lord against 
the Assyrians, not doubting that it would happen as if it 
were already there. All promises and words of God are 
such that they are much higher than all senses and all 
reason, so that the flesh cannot help but laugh at them 
and despise them. But only faith believes all this, which 
is also only in very few, just as at that time there were 
only the godly king Hezekiah and a few others who 
relied on such promises of God. This would also be 
understood by us if we were in the same situation as 
those who were promised these things at that time, if the 
furious princes and the pope came against us with a 
very powerful army to destroy us 2c. Then we would 
understand the custom and the power of these 
consolations. 


An avenger, yes an avenger is the Lord. 


He repeats it twice, which is an indication of certainty 
and vehemence. 


1338 D- xxvn, 66-‘s. Interpretations on d-the prophets. W. 


The Lord is an avenger against His adversaries, and 
He will not forget His enemies. 


This is a very rich comfort for the godly, because they 
hear that the Lord calls those his enemies who oppose 
the godly, who persecute and kill the godly. Thus the 
Lord also promised in the second book of Moses [Cap. 
23, 22.]: "I will be the enemy of thine enemies, and the 
adversary of thine adversaries." So here he calls the 
Assyrians his enemies, who were enemies of the people 
of Judah. What is it, therefore, that we should fear? All of 
them, even the most powerful ones, will not be able to do 
anything against us if we believe. For they fight against 
the Lord, not against us; they are the Lord's enemies, not 
ours. This fight will go very badly against them, since they 
choose to fight with God, the Most High and the Most 
Powerful. In the same way the prophet fortifies the hearts 
of Judah, as if he wanted to say: Be confident, they will 
not be able to hurt you in the least, all the hairs on your 
head are numbered, they are not dealing with you, but 
with the Lord; against Him they will fight very unhappily. 
Such very powerful promises all go against the ungodly 
blasphemies of the Assyrians, as | also mentioned above 
from Isaiah, and serve to uplift the hearts of the godly 2c. 


V. 3. The Lord is patient and of great strength. 


This verse has been interpreted in many ways; we 
interpret it with the apostle Paul according to Rom. 2, 4. 
For the prophet meets their question and their objection 
and takes precaution against it, since they could confront 
him in this way: You promise us freedom and salvation, 
the Assyrian will not do anything against us, yes, the Lord 
will be avenger against our enemies. But in the meantime 
they are safe, defy, boast against us and threaten us with 
destruction. The prophet answers: This is God's way, he 
is patient, he does not punish immediately, as Paul also 
says [Rom. 2, 4]: "Do you despise the kingdom? 


1) In the original: in deuteron. 


vi, 3047-3050. 1Z3A 


thum of His goodness, patience and forbearance? Do 
you not know that God's goodness leads you to 
repentance?" Here the prophet speaks in the same spirit, 
as if he wanted to say: He has suffered that the Assyrian 
rages and defies Israel, and now the Lord allows him to 
threaten you with evil. Thus God delays the punishment 
and postpones it; He allows the power of the adversaries 
to grow and rise to the highest level, so that they rage 
extraordinarily. And then, when there is nothing less 
before your eyes than that you will be victorious, when 
everything stands in despair with you, when it is 
impossible that you can resist him with any human 
power, then he is there and resists and wins gloriously. 
For God is great and almighty and also executes great 
things; against everything that is exceedingly strong and 
mighty he proves his strength. Thus he makes the 
wicked ascend to the highest, so that they may fall all the 
more heavily. All this perfectly describes the nature of 
God and His works, so that we will not despair, no matter 
how great fear may seize us, but will have confidence 
that the Lord will help us all the more quickly when we 
completely despair of being able to escape the danger 
that threatens us. And we should believe that the Lord 
will finally be an avenger against our, even against his 
enemies, because that is what the Lord calls them. But 
this is our weakness, that we always want the Lord to 
avenge immediately, and if he does not avenge 
immediately, we think it is over for us 2c. 


Before which no one is innocent. 
[Et mundans non faciet innocentem] is spoken 
according to the Hebrew way. We must translate 


differently, because the participium mundans must be 
omitted. But it is the same way of speaking in the Psalm 


[Ps. 49, 8.]: Frater redimens non redimet, which we 
express in Latin like this: Frater non redimet his brother 
cannot [Innocentans] 


innocentabit 2) or he will not let anyone be innocent, as 
if to say: They are not innocent before the Lord, however 
much men shine, however much they boast 


redeem]. So here: from

because of their righteousness and holiness. Those who 
are most sure because of their righteousness, he 
immediately makes guilty and judges that they are the 
most guilty. Thus the Assyrians also boasted against the 
people of God, that they had come by command of the 
Lord to destroy Israel, not according to their own will, 
they had been forced, as Rabshakeh says Isa. 36:10: 
"The Lord said unto me, Send up into this land, and 
destroy it." There must be such a delusion among all 
who persecute the godly that they think they are doing 
God a service, as Christ also says [John 16:2]. The 
same opinion is held today by our senseless princes, 
since they persecute the Gospel, which gives glory to 
the great God, and the preachers of the Gospel. But God 
finally avenges and judges quite differently, which is also 
our consolation today against the nonsensical bishops 
and princes. For the time being, we must give them the 
title that they are just. But the Lord will finally avenge the 
disgrace of his word, he will set the matter straight. In 
the meantime, we are to believe God, and let our 
innocence be suppressed, so that it is known to no one 
but God alone 2c. 


He is the Lord whose ways are in weather and 
storm. 


This is a glorious description of the vengeance of God 
against His enemies. For the vengeance is much greater 
than we can think or desire. As if he wanted to say: By 
no power, by no wisdom, by no counsel will they be able 
to resist the vengeance of the Lord, because the Lord 
comes like a weather and a storm. All this, as | said 
above, is spoken as a threat against the great and very 
powerful king of the Assyrians and for the comfort of the 
small and weak Judah. 


V. 4. who chides the sea and makes it dry. 


These are descriptions of the power of the Lord. He 
includes some examples that were known to the people, 
such as the passage through the Red Sea, through the 
Jordan, and others. And from these examples he makes 
certain general descriptions. As if he wanted to say: 
Once the Lord had crossed the Red Sea. 


He can do the same now, and he can do much more. 
Fear not, little host; if he has been able to dry up the sea, 
he will also be able to provide another sea 1) through 
which he will destroy the whole army of the Assyrians. 
How should we therefore fear, since the Lord is on our 
side, who can make the sea dry? The prophets have 
respected this history very highly, which can be seen 
everywhere; in the Psalm, where the prophet [Ps. 77, 
12.] says that he will remember the miracles of the Lord 
forever. 
And all the water dried up. 

Once he made the Jordan dry, therefore there is no 
river that he cannot dry up. So great is the power of the 
Lord who will fight for us that all your adversaries will not 
be able to resist him. 


Bashan and Carmel languish, and what flourishes 
on Mount Lebanon languishes. 

Bashan has a very fertile and productive soil, as it got 
its name from its fatness. Likewise, Carmel was 
extraordinarily fat and productive. Lebanon is a forest 
that is very full of trees. But it is our God who makes all 
this to perish, that is, he can make all power, all wealth, 
all abundance, all that is exceedingly mighty and strong, 
come to nothing. Therefore, let our enemies refrain from 
boasting because our God is mighty to destroy all power 
and even the mightiest troops 2c. 


V. 7.2) The Lord is gracious, and a steadfast in time 


of trouble. 

As above he frightened the adversaries, the enemies, 
with very great threats, so here he strengthens the godly 
of Judah, the small and little people, with a quite obvious 
promise and consolation, as if he wanted to say: To your 
godless adversaries the Lord is strong and terrifying and 
an avenger, but he is lovely and kind, to comfort in the 
time of tribulation. It is an extraordinarily glorious and 
comforting saying, which does not only apply to that 
challenge of Judah, but also to all the other troubles.

1342 L. XXVII, 71-74. Interpretations On the Prophets. W. VI. 3052-3055. 


1343 





The Lord must be referred to and applied in our times 
of affliction and adversity, so that we learn to take 
refuge in this goodness of the Lord as a sacred 
anchor in every challenge. Many psalms are full of 
such sayings, such as Ps. 9, 10:"The Lord is a refuge 
in trouble" 2c. But then the Lord is kind, then a helper, 
when we are greatly afflicted, when we hunger, when 
we suffer adversity, when our conscience is in 
anguish, as it is also said elsewhere in a Psalm [Ps. 
50, 15.]: "Call upon me in trouble, and | will deliver 
thee." He tells us to flee to him, to call upon him; 
otherwise the weakness of the human heart is so 
great that, although it is commanded to ask, and to 
take refuge in this goodness, it nevertheless trembles 
and mistrusts in the challenge. Namely, this is how 
the Lord comforts us in tribulation, that is, even 
though we are afflicted by temptation, he does not let 
us succumb. Paul says the same thing [1 Cor. 10:13]: 
"God is faithful, who will not let you be tempted above 
your ability, but will make the temptation come to an 
end so that you can bear it. 


And know them that trust in him. 

This is also an extremely comforting word, that the 
Lord knows His own, looks upon them, protects them 
and takes care of them, that He takes care of them, 
as David says in the Psalm [Ps. 121, 4.]: "Behold, the 
guardian of Israel neither sleeps nor slumbers." What 
greater comfort can there be in all adversity, in all 
temptation, both bodily and spiritual, than that the 
conscience knows for certain that the Lord looks 
upon it and that God takes care of it? Such a 
conviction overcomes sin, death, hell and _ all 
temptations. For such must be the conviction in every 
temptation, however great, that we may be 
persuaded that we shall have glory in the greatest 
shame, that we may be persuaded that we shall be 
satisfied in the midst of famine, that we shall have life 
when all is in despair 2c. And this is what is said in 
the first Psalm, v. 6: "The LORD knoweth the way of 
the righteous." But of the wicked it is added here: 





V. 8. 1) When the flood overflows. 


It is a Hebrew peculiarity, since he says, "When 
the flood overflows." Similarly, Isa. 28:18: "When a 
flood comes, it will tread you down." 2) And in the 
32nd Psalm, v. 6: "Therefore, when great floods of 
water come, they will not reach them." That is, the 
flood is indeed there, threatening calamity, the godly 
will be overwhelmed with many ills, but all this passes 
immediately, as weather passes, it will soon cease, 
as we also say in German, "Es ist nur ein 
Uebergang.” No matter how much your enemies 
rage, no matter how confident they are that they will 
swallow you up whole, they will be of no avail. They 
themselves will perish, you will escape unharmed. 
This is what Solomon says in Proverbs [Cap. 10, 25.], 
"The wicked is like weather that passeth over, and is 
no more." We have experienced all of this so far, and 
will continue to experience it in our godless princes, 
who have raged against the gospel of God together 
with the pope, as they have done nothing, as he says 
here: 


So he puts an end to the same. 


Some interpret this from the place where the army 
of Sanherib, king of the Assyrians, was killed, as the 
sacred histories report. But | think that this is a 
general statement, so that the opinion would be: 
"Wherever there may be a further or a flnt in any 
place, the Lord will let them pass by; the wicked will 
not do anything against the faithful. For in the very 
place where they intend to easily devour the godly, 
they themselves will perish and perish, while the 
godly will remain unharmed. Thus we, or those who 
will be after us, will see the miserable downfall of our 
princes,

who praise so senselessly against the glorious gospel of 
the great God. Christ will show how mighty a Lord he is, 
he will avenge the shame on the wicked, he will destroy 
them in the very place where they are now defying, 
boasting and raging against the godly, as he says here: 


But he pursues his enemies with darkness. 


Light in Scripture means happiness and prosperity, as 
| have reminded you several times above in the other 
prophets, as is evident from Proverbs Cap. 13,") 9. "The 
light of the wicked shall be put out." On the other hand, 
darkness means adversity, misfortune, bad success in 
all things. Hence the opinion: the wicked will perpetually 
perish, misfortune will not depart from them, while in the 
meantime the godly will remain unharmed, whom they 
wanted to be destroyed 2c. And so the prophet 
interpreted the verse of the first Psalm [v. 6]: "The Lord. 
knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the 
wicked perishes.” 


V. 9: What do you think against the Lord? 


In great certainty of the promise which he gives to the 
godly to strengthen them, and of the threat by which the 
godless are terrified, he directs his speech against the 
godless, as if to say: "What is it that you wretched people 
presume to fight against the Lord? Why do you so brave 
your strength and power? You set yourselves against 
the Lord, against whom you will fight quite unhappily. 
The battle you think of against the Lord will not go well 
for you. But the wicked believe nothing less than that 
they set themselves against the Lord. They think that 
they are doing God a service, which | have also shown 
above from the 36th chapter of Isaiah, where Rabshakeh 
says [v. 10.], "The LORD said unto me, Go up into this 
land, and destroy it."

Misfortune will not come twice. 


Instead of non consurget duplex tribulatio | 
translate after the Hebrew thus: Misfortune will not come 
again. All sophists have treated this passage; it has also 
tormented them extraordinarily, because it was a cause 


for innumerable questions to them. Also the magister 


sententiarum [Petrus Lombardus] has treated it. But 
with all these things we do not want to hold out. In short, 
| hold that this is the right opinion, as if to say, Thou, king 
of Assyria, hast done enough: thou hast laid waste the 
kingdom of Israel; thou hast now ruled enough. Now no 
other calamity will be added. | will not let you go on and 
destroy Judah also, for the LORD will deliver it from the 
calamity that now threatens, but another will not come 
upon it. But this the prophet speaks of his time, not of 
the whole time of the kingdom of Judah, because after 
that also the kingdom of Judah perished, as did that of 
Israel. A similar passage is in the book of Kings [2 Kings 
6:23]: "Since that time the men of war of the Syrians 
came not again into the land of Israel," 2c., that is, at the 
time when the war was waged between the king of Syria 
and Samaria, they did not return. This is also a general 
saying, which we can refer to all our misfortunes and 
adversities: our enemy will not always prevail against us; 
it will finally happen that he will succumb. It is an 
extraordinarily beautiful prophecy in Isaiah [Cap. 37, 
29.], where the spirit taunts the king of Assyria that he 
will return to his land in disgrace. Nowadays, our 
princes, the enemies of the Word of God, should also 
read these things, and learn here that they will not 
accomplish what they have undertaken to accomplish 
against the Word of God; they will perish in the midst of 
their nobility. Then they will fear nothing less than that 
they will perish. We have already experienced the same 
judgment in the false prophets of our times, who, while 
they were in the middle of their course, hoped to achieve 
what they had long since thought, 


1346 L. xxvn, 76-79. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3057-3060. 


1347 





have perished by the miraculous counsel of God and 
have been deceived in their ungodly hope, because 
they always have the judgment of God against them, 
which is written in the Psalm [Ps. 55, 24]: "The 
bloodthirsty and the false will not bring their lives to 
the half." Likewise [Ps. 21, 12.]: "They made plots 
which they could not carry out" 2c. All these 
judgments are also in store for the godless princes 
who are fighting against the Lord today, and they 
have nothing better to expect for themselves. If they 
do not desist from their ungodly nature and the 
practice of their cruelty, they will perish in the midst 
of their nobility. 


V.10. For as if the thorns, while they still grow in 
one another and are in the best sap, were burned as 
dry straw. 


| translate after the Hebrew thus: For while yet the 
thorns are tangled one in another, and they drink in 
their revelry, they shall be swallowed up as all dry 
straw. The prophet has used _ extraordinarily 
contemptuous words with which he belittles the 
immense power and the auxiliary troops of the king 
of Assyria, so that he compares them to dry straw. As 
if he wanted to say: Just as straw, which is 
completely dry, can easily be consumed by fire, so 
they will also easily perish, no matter how great their 
power and quantity may be. The most powerful 
troops are nothing against the Lord. For the Assyrian 
king had in his camp one hundred and eighty-five 
thousand armed men. The prophet compares this 
immense number to straw, which is what happened. 
For in one night the angel of the Lord smote this 
whole army, as the sacred histories and Isaiah, Cap. 
37, 36. For this is the end of the wicked, as we have 
seen in our false prophets. But he calls them tangled 
thorns, that is, they have joined their forces with one 
another, they have made friends with one another, 
they think that they will have the upper hand. And so, 
having joined their forces with each other, they are 
very presumptuous. But they are thorns, and will 
perish at the same time, like 


they have joined their forces. And when they shall 
drink in their carousals, and revel in royal splendor, 
they shall be sure of victory: then shall they perish. 
Like the preceding passages, this one also is to be 
used generally for any comfort, that we may have 
confidence in any persecution, when _ princes 
conspire against us, that they shall not avail, but shall 
perish, and be consumed like dry straw by fire. 


V. 11. 1) So the Schalksrath, which comes from you 
(Ex te enim exibit), gave way. 


This is a Hebrew expression, the like of which is 
found in Isaiah Cap. 49, 17: "Your builders 2) will 
hasten, but your breakers and destroyers will depart" 


(a te exibunt), that is, they will go away, they will 
leave you, "they troll away". It is quite the same idiom 
here, as if to say, "When these thorns are thus 
consumed, then from thee shall depart the 


Schalksrath (consiliarius Belial), who hath thought 
against the Lord; then shall he no more proceed to 
mock thee. Belial in Hebrew means the one whom 
we call a useless man, "a useless knave". 


V. 12 Thus saith the LORD; They come armed and 
mighty as they will. 


Shortly before [v. 9.] the prophet addressed his 
speech to the Assyrian to frighten him; he threatened 
him with destruction. Here he addresses the word to 
the distressed Judah, that he may comfort and 
deliver it. For the prophet prophesied in Jerusalem in 
the kingdom of Judah, not in Nineveh. Therefore the 
opinion is: Fear not. Let your adversaries, however 
well armed, however well armed, however rich, 
however wise, so that they may lack nothing of what 
belongs to a well-armed army. Then let there also be 
many armies, all of which threaten you with 
destruction, so take care of them.

you about all this nothing, let it not frighten you, 


V. 13 Then | will break his yoke that you bear, and | 


however well-equipped and numerous they may be. |will burst your bands. 


This is what John says in his epistle [1 Ep. 4, 4.], "He 
that is in you is greater than he that is in the world." 


Let them be knocked out (Attondentur). 


This word of the prophet is also spoken in the 
Hebrew way. Also Isaiah used this word ["to shear 
off"], because he says [Cap. 7, 20.]: "The Lord will 
shear off the hair with a hired 1) shearing knife" 2c. 
This is the shearing of the head, which occurs 
frequently in Moses and in other prophets, as in 
Isaiah [Cap. 3, 17.]: "The LORD will make the crown 
of the daughters of Zion bald." Hence the being shorn 


off (attondi), of which the prophet here says, is 
nothing else than that the people who are with the 
king shall be put to death. For the hair of the head 
and the beard signify the princes or the great men of 
the king, but the hair of the feet is the king's subjects, 
the great multitude, the lowest yeast of the people. 
And so the prophet exhausts everything with this one 
word and takes away everything that gave the 
Assyrian courage. Thus Ovid says: Now the seed 
stands where Troy was, and must be cut with the 
sickle 2c. 


And go there. 


This is fulfilled in the night when the angel of the 
LORD cut off all the hair of Sanherib, that is, when 
he killed in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and 
eighty-five thousand men, so that Sanherib, when he 
awoke, had to flee away with shame, Isa. 37:37. 


| have humbled you, but! will not humble you again. 


That is, until now | have allowed you to be 
plagued. Now the time is coming when | will free you, 
so that your enemies will no longer have the right to 
rage against you. | will not allow them to mock you 
any longer, but will turn all evil on their heads. 


1) Instead of aeuta, the Vulgate reads eonaueta. 


Quite the same words are in the second Psalm, v. 
3. "Let us break their bands, and cast from us their 
cords." "Yoke" he calls the dominion with which he 
has hitherto ruled over Judah. "Bands" he calls the 
yoke with which the Assyrian had hitherto oppressed 
and held Judah captive 2c. 


V. 14, 2) But against you the Lord has commanded. 

Now it passes again from Judah to Sanherib, the 
king of Assyria. This change of persons must be taken 
into account when reading the prophets. But he again 
uses a prophetic word when he says: "The Lord has 
commanded against you", since everything that 
happens is done by the word of God. "For when he 
speaks, it is done; when he gives, it stands," as it is 
said in the Psalm [Ps. 33:9]. Therefore, the opinion 
here is: The Lord will do something against you, he 
will command something against you 2c. 


That none of your name's seed should remain (non 
seminabitur de nomine tuo ultra). 


It is a Hebrew expression in the verbum [non] 


seminabitur [it will not be sown]. Some have referred 
this passage to the descendants of Sanherib, namely 
that the Lord had threatened that it would happen that 
he would not get any more descendants. But | rather 
refer it to the reign of Sanherib, so that this is the 
opinion: You have oppressed the lands of all nations, 
and all the labor of all peoples you have harvested; to 
you all taxes have been paid, because you have ruled 
over all. But now this will no longer take place, your 
kingdom will cease, your tyranny, which you have 
used until now, oppressing the nations and making 
them pay tribute; furthermore you will no longer be 
king, no more seed will be sown for you 2c. 


From the house of your God | will cut you off. 


That is, not only shall you no longer be lord in 
Judea, but not even in 


2) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 


1350 D- xxvn, 8i-83. interpretations on the prophets. W. vi, 30W-3064. 


1351 





your Assyrians, even in the house of your god you will 
be nothing. The prophet certainly saw this prophecy 
in his spirit, which was fulfilled afterwards, when 
Sanherib, after his army was destroyed, fled to the 
temple of his god, and was killed in the temple among 
the idols by his sons, 2 Kings 19:37. 


For you have come to nothing. 


That is, you will not be considered worthy to be 
buried in the place of kings, so you will be buried 
under your idols. The same threat is pronounced by 
the Lord in Moses [Deut. 2T, 30] against the Jews, 
when he says: "I will throw your dead bodies on your 
idols", so that one idol will fall on top of the other 2c. 
No doubt this contempt came upon king Sanherib, as 
some would have it, because he returned to his 
country as a fugitive without having accomplished 
anything and had lost the whole army. And so he had 
attracted the displeasure of his sons, by whom, no 
doubt, he was not killed so ignominiously among the 
idols in the temple of his god without the consent of 
the people. 


Cap. 2, 1. Behold, upon the mountains come the 
feet of a good messenger preaching peace. 


We are all convinced that there is not a single one 
among the prophets who did not include something 
in his prophecy about the future Christ and about the 
grace that was to be revealed through Christ. In this 
prophet | would like to draw this passage to Christ, 
because otherwise there is no other passage in this 
prophet that could be understood by Christ than this 
one. For these are also the same words in Isaiah 
[Cap. 52, 7.], which Paul cites in the Epistle to the 
Romans [Cap. 10, 15.] of the preachers of the 
Gospel, namely, that no one can preach the Gospel 
unless he is sent. But the name "gospel" is used not 
only for spiritual promises and consolations of the 
conscience, but also for any cheerful and good 
messages, by which also temporal good things are 
promised. And | am not quite sure yet whether the 
apostle Paul used this passage of Isaiah in his own 
words. 





to the gospel of grace (that is, which promises 
forgiveness of sins and salvation in Christ), which is 
what the prophet Isaiah said. So | think that this 
passage in our prophet Nahum is not only to be 
understood from the gospel of grace, which is 
promised and proven to us through Christ, by which 
the believers become children of God and joint heirs 
of Christ, but also from temporal promises, as, from 
the victory over the enemy and his destruction, from 
the gathering of the spoils, from the conclusion of 
peace 2c. Therefore, | think that it is said in a general 
expression of the temporal victory, to which, 
however, the grace of Christ and the gospel are 
inserted in general. 


See. 
This is the word of him who rejoices in victory. But 
he speaks after the manner of the prophets, as if it 
were present, while it was yet future. 


On the mountains. 

The land of the Jews was mountainous, therefore 
he speaks in a Hebrew way. We would say in 
German: "Now and then on the mountains", here and 
there in different parts of the country, as if he wanted 
to say: Everywhere a new rumor is spread, but the 
rumor of a glad messenger (evangelistae). Thus 
Lucas Cap. 1, 39. spoke after the same Hebrew 
manner: "But Mary arose and went up into the 
mountains." Likewise [v. 65]: "This story was all over 
the mountains of Judea" 2c. 


Feet. 
For a rumor runs fast, and becomes all the 
stronger the farther it goes (Viresque acquirit eundo), 
and the glad messengers (evangelistae) also run. 


The one who preaches peace. 


This is a Hebrew way of speaking, because the 
Hebrews say: You are at peace, where we say: It is 
well with your affairs. It is peace (that is, "it is well"). 


1352 L. XXVIL, 83-86. interpretation of Nahum (1.), cap. 2, 1. 2. W. VI, 3064-3067. 1353 





Keep your holidays, Judah. 

That is, be safe; now that the enemy king has been 
killed and the army destroyed, you can safely keep your 
holidays, which you could not do before because you 
were hindered by the war. Now those who belong to 
Judah will again go to the temple of the Lord, as the Law 
of Moses prescribes. 


Pay your vows. 


What "paying vows" is, we have dealt with above in 
abundance in the other prophets. But it means: to 
sacrifice to the Lord, and not only cattle, but to give 
thanks to God, to praise God, 2c., which are "the farrows 
of the lips", which God alone wants, 1) Hosea 14, 3. 


1) In the Altenburg manuscript reliMit; in the Wittenberg: reMirit. 
We hold that the latter reading deserves preference, despite the 
Weimar's remark: "Dies reliquit verstand die Wittenberger nicht und 
liest rshuirit." 


This whole passage, as | have said, can be applied to 
Christ and, more generally, to the gospel preached on 
the mountains, that is, in all lands, as the Psalm [Ps. 
19:5] says. But he preaches peace, that is, forgiveness 
of sins, and promises eternal righteousness in Christ, 
through whom we are to become lords over all creatures 
2c. And he exhorts the Jews to accept this gospel, 
saying, "Keep your feasts, Judah," 2c. that is, now offer 
your sacrifices, now pay GOtte your vows which you 
have made. Until now you have not sacrificed properly, 
you have not kept your holidays properly; now praise 
your God, now offer the farrows of your lips for the 
revealed grace, for now the mischief (Belial) will no 
longer come upon you, the enemies will henceforth no 
longer exercise tyranny against you, whether they be 
enemies in the flesh or in the spirit 2c. 


The second chapter. 


The Hebrews place the beginning of the second 
chapter at the point where the prophet addresses his 
speech to Sanherib, saying: "That none of thy name's 
seed should remain. And so they beautifully connect the 
downfall of the king with the downfall and destruction of 
the city of Nineveh, which Nahum prophesies in this 
second chapter. 


V. 2. the scatterer will come up against you. 


The beginning of this chapter seems difficult to us, 
because the Hebrew idiosyncrasies cause us a lot of 


trouble, as in general the ratio grammatica causes us 
more complaints than the opinion of the prophet. But the 
prophet begins to describe the capture and destruction 
of the city of Nineveh and, as it were, to depict it and to 
present it to Judah. For just as the prophet, through the 
Spirit, paints in his heart the disturbance of the 
Ninevites, so he also presents it to the hearers. It 


is therefore the opinion: You, king of Assyria, are now 
sitting in the city, fearful and extraordinarily timid. 
Whereas a short time before you were triumphant and 
almost alone, and extraordinarily defiant, you are now 
compelled to see the [enemy] army roaming to and fro 
before your eyes. And yet you dare not join hands with 
him and send out your army to hold off the enemy army, 
even though you see how the enemy army rages against 
yours after its own accord. Now you are besieged and 
disturbed, yet you do not dare to protest; sadly you hide 
yourself, while before you defeated all, besieged the 
remaining cities, and overcame and captured the 
besieged ones. 


AVer yes, rename the roads probably. 


He alludes to the custom of war, that even when 
there is no fighting on either side, guards are still posted, 
that some are used to be in ambush, in order to 


1354 L. xxvil, 86-88. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3067-3070. 


to keep an eye on the entrances to the roads, so that 
the enemy does not ambush them unawares and 
unprepared 2c. Thus he mocks the king of Assyria 
here, as if to say: Where are now your horsemen, who 
secure the roads, who lie in ambush. Well, break out 
at last and hold off the enemies. So everything is 
spoken mockingly. 


Equip yourself to the best (conforta lumbos). 
That is, be strong. 


And strengthen yourself most mightily. 


That is, be courageous, finally take courage, burst 
forth if you dare. 


V. 3: For the LORD will reward the hope of Jacob as 
he rewarded the hope of Israel. 


This passage is very obscure, especially in our 
Latin translation, but in Hebrew it is somewhat 
clearer. But it can be understood in two ways: first, 
that this is the opinion that some have: that you were 
so furious before, that everything went out for you so 
happily before, this happened because the Lord 
avenged Jacob's hope and carried it out through you 
as through his servant. Although | do not reject this 
opinion, | do not follow it. | rather think that it is to be 
understood in imitation, in this way: Before, you 
subdued all nations and subjected them to you, so 
that they would not be hopeful. But now the time has 
come when the glory of the kingdom of Jacob and 
Judah will return; Judah will no longer be afflicted, but 
will become glorious. And so "glory" here means the 
glory, the splendor, the splendor and the greatness or 
the adornment of the kingdom, which is also evident 
from Exodus 15:1, where the same word is found in 
Hebrew: "He has done a glorious deed," or he has 
acted gloriously 2c. Therefore the prophet is here 
mindful of the scorn of the Assyrians, with which they 


1355 


These are prophetic images, as if to say: There 
was no hope of regaining the kingdom. The people of 
Judah were no longer beautiful, the Assyrians had 
devastated everything; you raged cruelly against us, 
Sanherib, and mocked us. You will not mock us any 
more, now that the calamity has fallen on your head. 
Therefore you are now in disgrace, we are glorious 
and triumphant through the Lord as victors. To us is 
restored the glory of our kingdom, its honor and its 
adornment, which before was taken away by you 2c. 
And this is my opinion of this passage, and, preferring 
it to the other, | am induced to do so by the Hebrew 
word which our [Latin] interpreter has translated by 


the verbum reddidit, which seems to me quite remote 
from the Hebrew meaning. | translate thus: For as the 
LORD hath put to rest or laid low the courts of Jacob 


2c. But why he says here: "propagines", or what he 
wants to indicate by this, can be seen in the Psalm 
[Ps. 80, 9. 12.]:""You have raised a vine out of Egypt" 


2c., "and it has spread its branches (propagines) to 
the sea" 2c. He thus indicates that all Israel is 
distraught, that not even a few remnants are left in 
the land. 


V. 4. The shields of his strong ones are red. 


Here he begins to describe and to present the 
army of the Chaldeans, as if it were already coming. 
He says that they are red and like purple and like fire, 
to frighten the Assyrians, as if he threatens them with 
bloodshed; he sees them already killed and stained 
with blood. But he describes this as a consolation for 
Judah, as | have reminded above several times. 


His chariots glow like fire when he wants to hit. 1) 


That is, "their chariots therefore wisp," as burning 
torches give off a trembling light, so that the word 


triumphantly mocked others, and now brings it back praeparationis does not refer to 


upon their necks, as if to say: Now you finally cease 
to mock Judah 2c. 


Because the meter readers will read them, and spoil 
their fiber. 


1) Vulgate: I‘nsas dabsnas eurru" in die xrasxarationis 
sjus. Luther translates: Ourrus sieut Aarnina iBnis in die 
prasparationis sjus. 


1356 L. XXVII, 88-91. interpretation of Nahum (1.), Cap. 2, 4-7. 


the chariots, but to the flame or the fiery glow, since 
he does not describe chariots that are first to be 
prepared, but which are already equipped with all 
weapons and men of war, and the thus prepared and 
equipped he compares to a flame or torch, as if he 
wanted to say that they have flaming chariots. For that 
not only the Jews, but also all the Gentiles fought in 
chariots, is also known from the histories and the 
poets of the Gentiles. These chariots had an 
extraordinary speed, to which the prophet alludes 
here. 


Their skewers life. 
This is again very badly translated in our 


[lateiuischen] Bible: Et agitatores consopiti sunt, 
since the Hebrew word denotes projectiles, which are 
made of slender trees, likewise lance-bearers, as also 
Johannes Reuchlin interpreted it. It is therefore the 
Opinion: while the speed of the chariots is so great, 
while so in rapid running the chariots dahiurollen, the 
lance bearers, who sit on the chariots, shake and 
swing their lances. 


V.5. The chariots start rolling down the alleys. 


The Hebrew says: In the streets, or, in their course 
they speed along. These are quite Hebrew ways of 
speaking by which he indicates that the Chaldeans 
are advancing in their chariots without order and in 
heaps against the Assyrians, as if to say: "They are 
going along in heaps, no one knows who is the 
hindmost or the foremost." 


And rattle on the streets. 


That is, because of their quantity, they make 
noise. That's how large the number of wagons is, 
which arrive in such a hurry without any particular 
order. 


They look like torches. 


He said the same thing above. By all these things 
he frightens the Assyrians, since he describes the 
enemy, the Chaldean, as a very strong and well- 
armed one, as if to say: They appear like striking 
lightnings, fighting against themselves, striking one 
against the other 2c. 





W. VI, 3070-3072. 1357 


V. 6 But he will remember his mighty ones. 

This prophet has the way that he immediately 
changes the persons, immediately passes from one 
army to the other. Now he seems to speak of the 
Chaldeans in one and the same context, and yet he 
turns his speech in such a way that he speaks of the 
Assyrians, whose fear and fleeing army he 
describes, as if he wanted to say: Since the 
Chaldeans are threatening in fiery chariots, the king 
of the Assyrians will ask his great ones, his princes, 
by what means the coming Chaldean can be met. 
And so he mocks the Assyrian, as everything that 
follows in this chapter is full of mocking speeches. 
The Hebrew word, however, does not mean both 
strong and proud, pompous and glorious people, as 
if the prophet wanted to say: You certainly have 
excellent leaders and great men with you, now you 
should use their help' to hold off the enemies, but you 
have only pompous loudmouths and boasters with 
you. 


But the same will fall where they want to go out. 

That is, it is done for them, they will fall wherever 
they will go, in whatever they undertake, since they 
also have GOD as their adversary. 


And will hurry to the wall and the screen, because 
they are safe. 

Because the Hebrews connect this with the 
preceding to one verse, so | also understand this for 
the sake of the Assyrian. But the opinion is: So great 
is their despair, so distraught are they, that they dare 
not go outside the city to meet the Chaldean. They 
dare not hold off the enemy; they put their salvation 
in flight. They hurry to the walls, where they seek 
refuge; there they protect themselves with some kind 


of defenses; but these defenses (propugnacula) are 
hardly tents (tabernacula) or huts. For this is what the 
Hebrew word means. 


V. 7 But the gates of the waters are opened. 
Why he says "the gates by the waters" is not 
sufficiently known. But it is true 


1358 L. XXVII, 91-93. interpretations on the prophets 


. W. VI, 3072-3074. 1359 





It seems that he says of the gates of the waters 
because the city of Nineveh was_ artificially 


surrounded with waters (iffigua) and had rivers that 
flowed by, as is the case with magnificent and famous 
cities. But that others say, the gates of the waters, 
that means of the peoples, that seems to me to be too 
far-fetched and not to fit-. 


And the palace will go down. 


In Hebrew it says like this: The royal castle or 
palace is deserted. He does not describe both the 
desolation of the royal castle, as that it perishes of 
itself, or that | say so, collapses of itself. And so, as | 
have said, everything is full of mockery, as if the 
prophet wanted to say: The gates by the waters, 
which are otherwise firm, to which the entrance is not 
easily open, are now easily taken; they are open, and 
the royal castle falls by itself, even though it is not 
destroyed. - The judgment of God against this city 
seems so certain that it can be overcome with such 
ease. 


V. 8 The queen will be led away captive. 
Here | follow the opinion of Lyra: who [instead of: 


Et miles captivus abductus est in the Vulgate] 
translated thus: The spouse or queens are gone up 
captive, since the same word is also in the 45th Psalm 
[v. 10.], "The queen is at thy right hand.” Therefore 
the prophet mocks the queens and the wives of the 
princes, as if to say: namely, so gloriously does the 
queen walk in royal dress and honor. Until now she 
sat gloriously on a high throne, now she is led away 
captive and also sits on a throne, but on a disgraceful 
one. For now, instead of the former glory, she 
receives the highest disgrace. 


And beat the virgins to their breast. 
For so (tympanizantes) is actually to be translated, 


not, as our [Latin] Bibles read: murmurantes. For the 
same word is also in the Psalm, where it is correctly 
translated [Ps. 68, 26.]: "Among the maidens who 
tympanize" 2c. Therefore, as he mocks the queen. 


also of the maidens, who sigh and are consumed with 
sadness and bear grief over their captivity, as if he 
wanted to say: "| mean, they are now also dancing 
finely", since they are led away captive like this, "they 
are now beating their chests". Admittedly a fine 
dance, that is, they beat on their breast 2c. Thus the 
prophet compares the previous good life and the 
delightful 1) dances with the captivity. 


V. 9 For Nineveh is like a pool of water, but the 
water will flow away. 

He now describes the deserted city as if he 
wanted to saw: the city is taken, the royal castle lies 
desolate, the queen has been led away captive with 
all her maidens. Therefore Nineveh seems to be 
nothing else than a fishpond without water. For just 
as a fishpond becomes desolate and dry when the 
dam is broken and the water is let out, so it is now 
with Nineveh. Before, the city was populous and 
glorious; now that the dam has been broken by the 
Chaldeans, all who can flee are fleeing. They do not 
wait, though they are admonished that they should 
stay. As much as parents call out to their children and 
wives to their husbands, "Stay, stay," they take no 
heed, but secure themselves by fleeing. Thus the 
prophet delights in the desolation of Nineveh, which 
he saw coming. Therefore he depicts it to the afflicted 
people of Judah as if it were already present, namely, 
so that he may comfort them and strengthen their 
courage, as | have reminded above several times. 





V. 10: Now therefore, steal silver, steal gold; for 
here is no end of treasures. 


There is no end to the things that are gathered 
together, as there are utensils, precious household 
goods and all kinds of votive gifts. For all the precious 
things of all the nations they had seized, just as the 
Scriptures call such cities "mountains of plunder" [Ps. 
76:5]. Therefore the

1360 L. XXVII, 93-96. interpretation of Nahum (1.), Cap. 2, 10-14. 


W. VI, 3074-3077. 1361 





Prophet to the Chaldeans that they should plunder all 
that is best, since the inhabitants thus flee, since 
there is no end to the most delicious things, as 
follows: 


And the quantity of all delicious gems (gravis prae 
omnibus vasis). 

This word [gravis (XXX)] has been omitted by 
Jerome, or perhaps it has been omitted by the 
inattention of the scribe. But this piece is also full of 
mockery, as if he wanted to say: Since there is such 
a great abundance of all things: Come on, you 
Chaldeans, make them a little empty, so that they are 
not further weighed down as by a heavy burden; 
"help that it becomes lighter". 


V. 11. But now it must be purely read and 
plundered. 


The word dissipata should have been translated 
by vastata ["abgeleseu"], because above [v. 3.] he 
called them "readers" (vastatores) and here is the 
same word. Then it is plundered, finally destroyed. 
He says that it was first made desolate (vastatam) 
because its citizens and queens were thus taken 


away, secondly made empty by taking away the 
goods, thirdly destroyed by smashing the buildings. 


That her heart must despair. 


Namely, they do not remain safe anywhere, they 
have no place where they dare to stay even if they 
flee. 


The knees are shaking. 


Namely, there is no strength in the loins and back 
from too much despondency. 


And all faces look pale, like a pot. 

There is a similar passage also above in Joel [Cap. 
2, 6.], where the [Latin] interpreter translated thus: 
Facies eorum redigentur in ollam. Here he 
translates: Sicut nigredo ollae. Since these 
translations do not agree with each other, | translate 
like this: Congregentur in ollam. But what the 


prophet wants to express by this Hebrew picture, 
knows 





| do not. Usually it is interpreted thus: their sadness 
and affliction is so great that they are dirty and pale 
with fright, so that they seem to be like black pots. 
This is quite an inconsistent image, and | do not 
believe that the prophet intended this. | like this more, 
but | dare not say that the prophet intended this: they 
are to be consumed and destroyed as pieces of meat 
are consumed, which are thrown into a pot to be 
cooked, so that, like meat in pots, they are to be 
cooked by external evils and persecutions. This is 
how the prophet described the captivity of Nineveh. 
Now he adds a mocking song by which he mocks 
them, for a song of triumph follows, "he sings a little 
song of them," and thus he brings their former cruelty 
upon them. 


V. 12. Now where is the dwelling place of the lions? 

That is, where is your power now? What is 
Nineveh now, the exceedingly rich and great city? In 
it dwelt the mightiest princes, to whom all the heathen 
fell a prey. Like lions they robbed, since the world 
domination stood with them. 


V. 14. | will set your chariots on fire in the smoke. 

| will set on fire, namely through the Chaldeans. 
You who have lived gloriously until now in sunshine 
and highest honor, will perish in the smoke, 
shamefully you will perish. 


That the voice of your messengers should no 
longer be heard. 

That is, | will put an end to your kingdom, 
henceforth you will never send out your messengers; 
it is the end of your rule. "Messengers", in fact, is what 
he calls the princes and governors who were 
appointed by the Assyrians throughout the world, who 
carried out the royal orders, who administered the 
magistracy everywhere and collected the customs 
and imposts. All this, he says, will now cease, that is, 
the empire of the Affyrians will perish. 


1362 xxvii, 96-98. interpretations on the prophets. W. vi, 3077-3080. 1363 


The third chapter. 


V. 1. Woe to the murderous city. 

The prophet still stands by his prophecy that 
Nineveh will be destroyed and the Assyrian kingdom 
laid waste. For though he has said these things 
abundantly in the second chapter above, yet he 
delights and is rich in spirit with many words and 
images; as is the way of the prophets, he repeats the 
same things. But the opinion of this chapter is also 


easy, only the word sense (ratio grammatica) will 
cause us difficulty. 

According to Hebrew he said: "city of blood" 
instead of: murderous, cruel city, which is inclined to 
shed blood. 


Which is full of lies and robbery. 
Instead of universa mendacii, it should more 
correctly read: which is entirely lying. - Dilaceratione 


plena, that is: violence reigns in you, there is no end 
to your robbery; the one is after the other's goods 
when and how he can. He punishes three vices, as if 
to say: The hour of your disturbance has come, you 
have been too cruel and mendacious, there is no 
more faithfulness, no more constancy in you, finally 
everything is full of robbery. It cannot but be so in all 
the kingdoms of the world when they have come to 
the highest, when they have begun to blossom most 
2c. 


And will not let go of their robbery. 


You are, as it were, a maw of all goods, for you 
consume all possessions as wild animals do to each 
other. 


V. 2 For there shall be heard the scourges 
clattering, and the wheels rattling. 


The long-suffering of God is great, as all Scripture 
everywhere indicates; with great patience He bears 
our sins as long as they are hidden, but when we are 
blinded to such an extent that they also become 
generally known, that the shameful deeds seem to 
have grown on us, as it were, and we have, as it were, 
a Ge 





If they make a habit of it, then he can no longer 
tolerate it, but he punishes them. We see the same 
thing here. He threatens the Ninivites with destruction 
and the wrath of the Lord, because they did not know 
how to keep a measure in their ungodliness. But | 
read according to the Hebrew everything [which in the 
Vulgate is in the genitive] in the nominative, namely 
thus: the rattling of the wheels, and the wild horses, 
and the rolling chariots, and the riders on the horses, 
and the shining of the swords, and the flashing of the 
spears 2c. But he paints by all these things, as it were 
as a painter on a tablet, the hostile army of the 
Chaldeans against the Assyrians, and_ the 
lamentation of the Assyrians, and sets it before his 
eyes, as he also did above in the second chapter [v. 
4. f.], as if he wanted to say: with great vehemence, 
with great zeal, the charioteers drive the horses and 
the chariots forward, with great impetuosity and 
rattling, they go almost over neck and head, they 
crash with great violence, and the riders sit quickly on 
the horses, the spears shine like lightning 2c. But he 
speaks of the war chariots in which fighters sat, as 
also the histories of the pagans report. 


V. 3. 1) There lie many slain and great heaps of 
corpses (et gravis ruinae). 

This is the other part of the painting, as | said, 
namely the lamentable misfortune of the Assyrians, 
which he presents as it were as present, as he saw it 
in the spirit as future. By the way, the Hebrew word 
which our interpreter here translates by aravis is 
frequent in Scripture, and has always been so 
translated, as, in the first book of Moses [Cap. 13, 2.]: 


"Abram was very rich (gravis) in silver and gold." 
Likewise [Cap. 12, 10.]: "The theurung was great 
(gravis) in the land," that is, great, much. So it is here, 


(vravis ruina, that is, the quantity and size of the dead 
bodies. 


1) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 


1364 xxvii, 98-ioi. Interpretation of Nahum (1.), Cap. 3, 3-5. w. vi, ei-e. 1365 





For what we read here: ruinae, is badly translated, as 
also in the Psalm [Ps. 110, 6.]: Judicabit in nationibus, 
implebit ruinas, where so should have been translated: 


implebit cadaveribus [he will make it full of corpses]. 
So also here must be translated. 


V. 4. All this for the sake of great fornication. 


He gives the cause of this lamentable defeat, which 
he describes as already present, as it were. | translate 


after the Hebrew thus: Propter fornicationes 


fornicariae gratiosae, maritae maleficiorum [the wife 
of sorceries]. This he has spoken entirely after the 
Hebrew manner, as when they say, Beelzebub, that is, 
the man of the fly, and the man of the wind, the man of 
the blood 2c., instead of: a void, a cruel man. So here: 
the woman of sorceries, that is, the sorceress. 


Who with her fornication has acquired the heathen 
and with her sorcery the land and the people. 


| believe that the prophet speaks in figures and 
images, so that he names idolatry, godlessness and 
contempt of God with the word fornication according to 
the way of the Scriptures. And because no nation is so 
crude and savage that it should not also boast of the 
name of God and the service of God, which we see in the 
Turk and in all other sects, also in the Pabst, the 
Assyrians also used the name and the service of God for 
their godless nature, for their idolatry. Therefore they 
dragged many Gentiles with them into the same 
godlessness, as the prophet says here, as if he wanted 
to say: So great is your godlessness, so far you have 
brought it, that you have also joined many Gentiles to you 
in your godlessness. 1) Moreover it [the city of Nineveh] 
had many ungodly teachers, whom it kept to increase 
their ungodliness 2c. It is a Hebrew idiom, as he says, 


Vendidit [gentes], that occurs frequently in Scripture. 
Also 


1) Our template offers: ut multas etiam Mutes in suarn irnpietatein 
sibi soeiavit. Instead, we have adopted: ut rnultas etiam Mntes in tua 
impietate tibi sooiaveris. The Wittenberg has also retained the second 
person and reads: ut rnultas etiarn Mntes tidi oonsooiaveris. 





Paul made use of the same in the Epistle to the Romans 
[Cap. 7, 14.], "Sold under sin." So here: It sold the 
Gentiles, that is, it lured them to itself, and caused them 
to fall into the same ungodly nature, so that in such a 
way they also perished. He punishes [by the word "sell"] 
the avarice of false teachers, who lure people, and by 
their misfortune acquire goods 2c. 


V. 5.2) | will uncover your brooding under your face. 


Here the prophet seems to me to speak again 
poetically after his manner. For he alludes to the 
unchaste inclination of the heart when it is inclined to 
fornication, and so he indicates spiritual fornication, as if 
to say: Just as a public whore is ready and gives herself 
up to commit fornication with everyone, so also you have 
made yourself common to everyone by your idolatry. 
Therefore | will expose your evil, your abominations, | 
will make your sins manifest to you, and | will put you to 
shame so that you will be a spectacle to all the nations. 
This is God's way, that when He wants to destroy the 
wicked, He first reveals their wickedness to them. We 
see this today in the case of the priest, whose fornication 
is revealed through the gospel, and therefore all those 
things which before were extraordinarily pleasing and 
approved are now quite stinking and an abomination. 
For what is now considered a greater abomination than 
the ungodliness of the masses? whereas before the 
gospel was revealed, everything seemed to be 
exceedingly holy and conformed to the word of God 2c. 


And will show your shame to the kingdoms. 


He now contrasts "the shame" with what he had said 
above [v. 4]: "the beautiful dear whore", as if he wanted 
to say: Now you are pleasing, now you are pleasant, but 
the heathen and the kingdoms will have a disgust for 
you. | will make you completely stink, so that it will be 
obvious to them how disgraceful you are. And | will see 
to it that this happens, as he also adds here:

Our Latin interpreter translated here quite badly by | SPlendid, situated in a lake of the Nile. Otherwise, of 


the word abominationes. The same [Hebrew] word is 
also in the Psalm [Ps. 107, 40.]: He pours out 
contempt on the princes, that is, he will make them 
contemptible, and that by the light of the word. This is 
how it must be understood here: | will make you an 
abomination to all, stinking to all. 


And ravish you. 

In Hebrew this is a well-chosen word, as if to say: 
| will make you a fool. This Hebrew way of speaking 
is also followed by the Germans when they say 
against someone whom they severely rebuke: "You 
are a fool." Therefore, he calls the recognized and 
rebuked and fully announced foolishness a disgrace. 


V. 7. 1) Who will have compassion on you? 

That is, who will have mercy on you? as if to say, 
All will rejoice at your downfall; there will be no one to 
comfort you 2c. 


V. 8. Do you think you are better than the city of No 
of the Regents? 

This is one of the most difficult passages in the 
Prophets. The Latin interpreter has changed 


course, we can determine nothing from this passage 
of the prophet. What our interpreter translates: 


populorum, is also badly translated. | translate this 
passage thus: Are you better than No (Minno == 
XXX) the artist? Because the Hebrew word [sw] 
means a pupil, an artist or work master. 


V. 9. 2) Mohrenland and Egypt was their countless 
power. 

This moves me, why | hold that this city was the 
capital of the kingdom of Ethiopia. Because this 
description agrees in all pieces to the firm city, which 
Josephus describes. 3) 


V. 11. So you also must get drunk and hide yourself. 


As if he wanted to say: So no counsel and no 
wisdom is against the Lord, so no power is sufficient 
when the Lord is angry. Therefore, if this city, so 
exceedingly strong, so very mighty and rich, could 
not escape the judgment and vengeance of the Lord, 
you will escape much less. You must also become 
drunk with the cup of the Lord's wrath and anger. For 
this is how the prophets often speak of the cup that 
must be drunk, as Jer. 25, 27: "Drink that you may be 


whimsically. Jer. 46, 25. he translated like this: Ecce | drunk, drank 4) and fall down 2c. Likewise Ps. 75, 9: 


ego visitabo super tumultum Alexandriae; here he 
translates: Alexandria populorum, and the same 


word Alexandria is also in Ezekiel [Cap. 30, 14. 15.]. 
Now the question arises, of which city the prophet is 
speaking, for there has been much dispute about this 
matter. It is certain that the prophet makes the city of 


"The LORD has a cup in his hand, and poured out full 
of strong wine" 2c. See Isa. 51, 17. 


And seek a stronghold from the enemy. 
That is, the enemies oppress you, therefore, 
because they are so strong, you will seek help 
everywhere, but you will not find it. It is done for you, 


Nineveh a lesser one than that of which the prophet | YoU are gone 2c. 


speaks here. For he makes an inference from the 
greater to the lesser, which is quite clear from the text. 
Therefore he spoke of an old and glorious and very 
noble and mighty city, be it of the old Thebes, of which 
it is said that it had a hundred gates.

fortifications are like fig trees with their first fruits; if 
someone shakes them, they fall into the mouth of the 
one who wants to eat them. The prophet ridicules the 
presumption of those who are left in the city, who 
think that they cannot be conquered so soon, since 
they are surrounded with walls, but he says that they 
are quite easy to overcome, namely, just as ripe figs 
are shaken with little effort. For if the tree is only 
moved, they fall easily. So also the Chaldeans would 
conquer without effort. As if he wanted to say: The 
king of the Chaldeans will beat you with a small team 
and overcome. With very little effort all your 
fortifications will be taken because your heart is 
despondent, as he is about to add. In short, he 
indicates that the might of the Assyrians is in despair, 
and attributes to them despairing hearts, but to the 
Chaldeans a very easy victory, an excellent and 
confident courage. 


V. 13. Behold, your people shall become women in 
Ou. 

: He interprets the parable of the traveling cowards, 
and this is the summary of the passage: "There is no 
courage left in you, no confidence, no hope of future 
victory, even everything on your side is in despair, 
since the men who should be courageous, whose 
service and strength you should now use to hold off 
the enemy, are as fearful as women; their courage 
has been taken away by God's judgment. For the fact 
that women have weak courage is indicated not only 
by the writings of the pagans, but also by the holy 
Scriptures. 


And the gates of your land shall be opened to your 
enemies (aperiendo aperientur portae). 

He spoke according to the Hebrew way. For this 
is how the Hebrew language is used to speak: 
rejoicing | will rejoice, exulting | will exult. So here: by 
opening the gates will be opened, that is, wherever 
your country has been closed, the enemies will enter, 
they will break through, you will not be able to resist 
them 2c. 


According to the Hebrew | read thus: Draw for 
yourself the waters of the siege, strengthen your 
fortifications, go into the glue and tread the clay or 
mortar. What now follows to the end of the chapter is 
full of the bitterest scorn and mocking speeches, by 
which the enemies are wont to mock those defeated 
by them, as if he wanted to say: Yes indeed, draw 
water, mix the glue, with which you may mend the 
cracks in the walls. "Yes, yes, mend and glue again." 
You are of course excellent warriors, who keep 
yourselves constantly hidden within the walls. You 
undertake everything in a feminine way, so that you 
do not even dare. To go out of the city once to hold 
off the enemy. Meanwhile, you fetch water, bricks and 
fortifications with which you think you can hold off the 
onslaught of the enemy. Thus he alludes to the 
custom in war. But he says water of siege, as if to say, 
the water you need, since you are already besieged. 


Kick the clay (calca bitumen). 
It is the same word in the first book of Moses, Cap. 
14, 10: "The valley of Siddim had many clay pits." 


Furthermore, what we read [in the Vulgate]: tene 
laterem, is to be read according to the Hebrew: 


fortifica lateres, as if he wanted to say: Come on, 
prepare yourself bricks with which you can repair 
what is torn and broken by the warlike onslaught. You 
will do nothing. In vain you undertake everything; as 
he adds: 


V. 15 But the fire shall devour thee, and the sword 
shall kill thee; it shall devour thee as the beetle. 

Thatis, all your efforts are in vain; in vain you build 
fortifications by which you hope to be safe. For the 
army of the Chaldeans will set fire to the whole city, 
including the brickyard, and will kill you all. The 
Chaldeans, the slayers, will fall upon you as beetles 
fall in heaps. These parables of the beetles, the 
locusts and | don't know what other animals of this 
kind 


1370 L. XXVII, 106-108. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3086-3089. 


are common in the Scriptures, but we, who do not 
know these animals, are not comfortable with these 
similes. Solomon describes the kind of locusts, 
Proverbs 30:27: "Locusts have no king, yet they go 
forth in multitudes." But there are many kinds of these 
animals, and the Hebrew language has a special 
name for each of these kinds. Jerome says that the 
species the prophet is talking about here, the beetles, 
crawl on the earth more than they fly, and eat 
everything down to the root, and are an exceedingly 
harmful enemy of all crops. Without doubt Jerome 
has concluded this from the circumstances given in 
the text. For this is approximately how the prophet 
describes them, and yet they are counted in Moses 
among the clean animals, that is, among those that 
the Jews were allowed to eat [Mos. 11, 22]. 


It will attack you like beetles (Congregare eygo ut 
bruchus). 
It is here the same word in Hebrew, which stands 
above [P. 3.] soon after the beginning of this chapter: 


gravis ruinae, that is, a great, numerous heap of 
corpses of the slain, as | have interpreted it above, 
following the example of Scripture in the first book of 
Moses. Therefore, it should have been translated 


here thus: Gravescere sicut bruchus, gravescere 
sicut locusta. But that the Latin interpreter has 
translated by two [different] verba [congregare and 


multiplicare] is an ill-applied verbosity, for in the 
Hebrew there is only one and the same verbum [in 
both places]. They are now words of a scoffer and 
quite full of derision, as | have said. Therefore the 
opinion is: Come on, gather yourselves together, 
make yourselves much, take on a large crew, 
strengthen yourselves, so that you may strike down 
the enemy, so that you may do harm, as the beetles 
and the locusts are wont to do harm and fall in droves 
on the seeds or trees. But you will try in vain, you will 
not be able to gather together, since you are 
scattered as the flying beetles and locusts are 
scattered. You have no power; all your mightiest 
have lost their courage, all have become 


1371 


like women, they are without counsel and strength of 
mind 2c. as he said above. 


V. 16. You have more merchants than there are 
stars in the sky. 

That is, you, Nineveh, are now strong; now act 
defiantly, hold off the enemy. For now you are 
humiliated; even though you had such great riches, 
such great power, even though you have increased 
and become rich through great commerce, and even 
though all the cities that engage in maritime trade 
used to come together at your place, now you are 
unable to do anything. The roads are deserted and 
there is much space in the streets because of the 
small number of inhabitants, whereas before you 
used to be very populous. It is an exaggerated 
speech (hyperbole), since he says: "as stars in the 
sky". This image is often used in Scripture to indicate 
the quantity and abundance and power of something. 
In the same way the Lord spoke to Abraham in the 
first book of Moses, Cap. 13, 16, of the dust of the 
earth and the stars of heaven, saying that the seed of 
Abraham would not be less, that is, there would be a 
great and innumerable descendant from Abraham. 


But now they will spread out, like beetles, and fly 
away. 

That is, you are beetles, which fly away, only ready 
to flee, which scatter. But the Chaldeans are the right 
beetles, because they gather together; but you 
scatter, as he lays out: 


V.17. Your masters are as many as locusts, and 
your captains as beetles, which lie down by the fences 
in the cold days. 

He explains what he wants to indicate with the 
flying beetles, as if he wanted to say: | do not 
compare you to the flying beetles but to the flying 
beetles. You do not fly away in heaps with great 
confidence and do harm, as the Chaldeans do, for 
you are crawling locusts that fear for themselves that 
they will perish from the cold; they hide themselves 
wherever they can, they 


1372 L. XXVII, 108-110. interpretation of Nahum (1.), Cap. 3, 17-19. 


W. VI, 3089-3091. 1373 





do not seek so much to harm as to be preserved by 
some warmth, that they may live, as he adds here: 


But when the sun goes out, they move away. 

Jerome says that this is the species which hides 
itself entirely in fences in cold weather, but when the 
sun shines warmly, it flies away, and one cannot find 
its place 2c. Finally, there is a great and exceedingly 
harsh mockery in the word "“encamp" 


(castrametantur) (for this is how | translate it 
according to the Hebrew instead of what our Latin 


interpreter translates: consident), as if he wanted to 
say: It is certainly an excellent setting up of a camp, 
since you do not camp against the enemies, but in 
fences. In this way you will certainly beat off the 
enemy! Shall this be done by flight or by team? You 
make your fear your fortress, as follows: 


V. 18. Your shepherds will sleep, O king of Assyria, 
your mighty ones will lie down; and your people will 
be scattered on the mountains, and no one will gather 
them. 

He gives the reason that he compared them to the 
locusts flying away, and it is the opinion: Your 
princes, who should be in the first line, sleep for fear 
and do not even dare to go out; they hide in nooks 
and crannies, "they creep", like the locusts in the 
fences. Everywhere they look for hiding places where 
they could be safe. Therefore, you will fight 
unhappily, since there is fear everywhere, the princes 
take counsel by flight, the people are scattered and 
wander about without a leader 2c. 


V. 19. No one will mourn for your loss (Non est 
obscura contritio tua). 
The judgment of God against you is evident. You 
have become a spectacle to all, since you 


yes, while the whole world watched, you were 
trampled, and you will not be able to heal this your 
evil in any way. Your misfortune is evil, so that even 
the hand of a Chiron 1) cannot lift it; it is done for you. 
For so much is lacking that some should bear sorrow 
over this your lamentable misfortune, that "all who 
hear such from you will clap their hands over you. 
They will rejoice that thou art stormed. For thou 
Assur, and thou Nineveh, and all the kingdom of the 
Assyrians, didst before inspire terror in all, all didst ye 
attack. Now that you will be disturbed again, they will 
rejoice and grant you this disturbance and the 
judgment of God that has come upon you. 

Here we see how everything in this prophet is full 
of consolation, through which the dear God comforts 
His blessed ones against the power and the will of the 
enemy. These consolations should also encourage 
all of us in every adversity, so that we may have 
confidence and believe that the Lord will certainly not 
allow the adversaries of the Word of God to prevail 
against us. For as he had promised Judah salvation, 
and that the kingdom should be preserved, out of 
which Christ should be born, and _ fulfilled his 
promises, so he made them conquerors of all their 
enemies, which he here quite evidently showed in the 
kingdom of the Assyrians, so exceedingly powerful 
and rich. So we should also not doubt that he will also 
help us in all distress, whether it be physical or 
spiritual. For it is still the same God who redeemed 
Judah, who said that not a hair of our head should fall 
from his will [Matth. 10, 29].

About Nahum. 


Preface. 


The prophet brings his prophecy in line with his 
name, because Nahum means a comforter or a 
consoler. #) For the prophet comforts the tribe of 
Judah, which was almost in despair after the kingdom 
of Israel had been devastated and carried away by 
the Assyrians. °) This captivity had caused great fear 
and terror to all neighbors,° ) but especially to Judah, 
which the triumphant enemies mocked and boasted 
of the very certain victory. These he frightens with 


a) He must do enough for his name. 

b) This the prophets had foretold, and that it should never be 
brought back. Among these was Jonah, who, sent as an apostle to 
Nineveh, preached there with great fruit, namely so that the 
punishment was postponed 2c. 

c) Micah 1, 11. Sirach of the Vulgate): The neighboring house had 
raised a lamentation because Israel was distraught. This the prophets 
Nahum, Habakkuk and Zephaniah comfort that they should trust in 
GOD and not worry about the power of the Assyrians, nor about their 
own littleness, but look to GOD's power. 





He threatens the Assyrians and _ uplifts and 
strengthens the fainthearted others with the sweetest 
promises. For he says that it will happen that the 
Assyrians will again be weighed down by the 
Chaldeans with a heavy burden. °) For since the 
human heart is too weak to bear prosperity in 
modesty (for such are we by nature, that when all 
goes well we are hopeful, and when God's scourge 
ceases, sins heap upon sins), it happens that God 
punishes the lavish hearts most severely, destroying 
one kingdom by another, ruining one people by 
another. For thus he has disturbed the kingdom of the 
Assyrians by the Chaldeans, the Chaldeans by the 
Persians, the Persians by 


d) This is the prophet's way of keeping the small part of the people 
in the faith against God, so that for a short time until Christ comes, the 
service given to the fathers, to whom it was promised that there would 
be no lack of one who would sit on the throne of David, would be 
preserved. 





*We have already given information about these lectures in general in the first note to the previous relation. Therefore, it only remains 


for us to give the necessary information about the codex from which this writing is taken, and to show the location of it in the editions. - This 
interpretation (this we take from the Weimar edition) is reproduced according to the Zwickau manuscript No. 36, in which we also find Luther's 
"Lecture on the Book of Judges" (about which we have spoken in the preface to the third volume of our edition, p. VI), as well as a colorful 
mixture of sermons, letters, anecdotes, and legends. What comes from Luther in it covers three decades. The postscripts are by different 
hands. From page 63 to 112 is an extremely extensive revision of Luther's lectures on Zechariah, which, however, contains only the first four 
chapters. Then follows on pages 113 to 131 the interpretation of the prophet Nahum. This is not a direct college booklet, but in the same 
one, approximately of the nature of the Zwickau manuscript No. 3, in which the lectures from Joel to Micah are contained, is processed. 
However, this treatment receives a special value by the fact that another postscript, which corresponds in many places with the Altenburg, 
but especially with the Hallische manuscript, is used in not a few places in the text, but especially for numerous marginal notes. Some of 
these are, of course, superfluous, because they coincide in content with what the text offers. Our writing is printed for the first time in the 
Erlanger, exe’. opp., torn. XXVII, p. 7, then, compared anew with the manuscript and improved many times, in the Weimar edition, vol. XIll, 
p. 345. We have translated according to the latter edition. The marginal notes are indicated by letters, other notes by numbers.

the Greeks, the Greeks by the Romans, the Romans 
by the Goths and Turks. °) Thus we see that also the 
kingdom of Pabst is made shaky by the word of God. 

In this way, he also predicts here the disturbance 
of the Assyrian empire, in which- 


e) Thus great things do not stand long, because the hearts are puffed 
up against their creator. Thus the Assyrians, because they had 
accepted the preaching of Jonah, are in a very good kingdom, but go 
to ruin when riches flow to them. For it is impossible for nature to keep 
itself in check in prosperity and good days, that it should not, when the 
kingdom is thus in bloom, exercise all evil. 


i. 2. 1377 
chem Nineveh was the seat of the kingdom, where 
Jonah was sent and brought them to repentance, 
and caused the punishment to be postponed but not 
cancelled. For seeing that GOD was reconciled, they 
were turned back to their former life, namely to their 
former vices, by the postponement of the threatened 
punishment. For this reason, he says, it will happen 
that they will be weighed down with a heavy burden, 
and the people of GOD will be freed from this burden 
of bondage. This is what he says in the beginning: 
"This is the burden over Nineveh" 2c. 





The first chapter. 


V. 1. This is the burden over Nineveh, ' ) and the God, who has zeal and careful regard for His own, 


book of the prophecy of Nahum of Elkos. 
As if one said in Latin: Liber visionis Nahum 
Helcosensis (of the city, as Micah got the name 


who cares for His own, and for whom He is a zealot. 
h 


The Lord is an avenger, yes, an avenger is the Lord

Moraschites from Maresa) de onere, quod futurum} with these words he insists that one should trust

Nahum, the Elkosite, of the burden that will come much as everything seems to be against it. For this 
over Nineveh]. 9) This burden the Ninevites will not [doubling of the words promises the most certain 
be able to cope with, nor will they shake it off with any salvation and the quickest help. For it is well known 


natural powers, but will succumb under it and be |that the repetition of the same thing 


destroyed. , 


V, 2. The Lord is a zealous God. 


These words seem to be cold, but if you look 
closely at the matter, that is, the present calamity, 
they are very glowing words by which he directs the 
downcast to hope and frightens the stiff-necked 
godless enemies, since he says he is a zealot. 


f) Here the prophet first calls his prophecy "a burden", namely, 
which the Lord has laid on them. It is a comfort that he says: "the 
burden on Nineveh", as if he wanted to say: The judgment will turn; 
you will be delivered, but those will be oppressed. - | like the opinion 
of Jerome, that "chon Elkos" is the name of a small place, not of the 
father. 

g) Nineveh was the capital of the empire of the Assyrians, which 
Ninus founded. That means: the beautiful one, "beautiful city" or 
"beautiful castle". 


in the holy scripture is an indication of 
certainty and reliability. Gen. 41:32: "But the fact that 
Pharaoh dreamed another time means 1) that God 
will surely and quickly do this." 


h) The people of Judah are fearful; those are secure, powerful, 
and consider the wretched yeast as nothing. See the mockery of 
Rabshakeh Isa. 36, 4. ff. - But these could not believe that GOD would 
take vengeance on such an exceedingly powerful kingdom. Hezekiah 
and the godly Jews receive this word with joy, "there belongs" faith. 
He did it and will still do it, that he beat a great multitude with a small 
team. 

i) Such things we shall take to God; if we had faith and spirit, we 
would do it. - He is a zealot and holds fast to his anger; he will not let 
it go until he has given vent to his wrath.

1379 





The Lord is an avenger against his adversaries. 

The kindness of God is exceedingly great that He 
joins with us and says that our enemies are His 
enemies. ') Dear one, what more effective or stronger 
consolation can there be than to hear that God is on 
your side and is your covenant companion in battle? 
Who should not blow himself out in exceedingly holy 
hope in GOD against his enemies, boasting and 
exalting himself? if only he believes that what is said 
here is true: "He is an avenger against his 
adversaries"? So also to Abraham it was said, Gen. 
12, 3: "I will bless those who bless you, and curse 
those who curse you." Likewise Gen. 26:24 [to Isaac], 
"Fear not, for | am with thee." This also they 
confessed who otherwise did not favor Isaac, saying 
[Gen. 26:28.], "We see with eyes to see that the 
LORD is with thee." 


V. 3. The Lord is patient and of great strength. ‘) 

Here the nature of God is described, who proceeds 
slowly to vengeance and does not punish 
immediately, but lets the power of the wicked grow to 
the highest, so that he finally helps at the right time. 
'’ We would like a thing to be destroyed before it is 
begun, but he is slow to anger. With these words he 
answers the objection of the wicked, who were puffed 
up by the confidence in their powers and might 


j) "They have not fenced well." - This is a great pride and glory for 
the weak. 2 Mos. 23, 22. it says -. "I will be the enemy of your 
enemies" 2c. - These are all terrors that he thunders to frighten the 
enemies of God's people, to encourage and raise up the weak and to 
frighten the mighty. - Whoever believes that God is ours "must also 
believe" that our enemies are God's enemies 2c., "it all depends on 
faith". 

k) His nature is such that he is long-suffering and of great strength, 
"he does not put his strength into a small thing." Thus: The LORD is 
slow to anger and of great power. - This for the sake that we may have 
good hope, and the adversaries may be terrified when they come to 
know God's nature 2c. Here is a description of the nature and 
character of God, "what manner of man he is, and what is his nature." 
This is how Paul treats this passage, Rom. 2, 4. 

1) God is doing great things that would not happen if everything did 
not stand in despair beforehand. 


against Judah: nothing less would happen than that 
they would be saved. Well known are the extremely 
ungodly threats of Sanherib against Hezekiah, Isa. 
36 and 37:™ ) Do not be deceived by your God, in 
whom you trust. [Cap. 36, 18.:] "Have even the gods 
of the heathen delivered every man his land out of 
the hand of the king of Assyria?" 2c. [V. 19.:] "Have 
they also delivered Samaria out of my hand?" 2c. 
Against these fiery darts of Satan a servant of God 
must be well armed, that he may know God's way, 
who does not at once set his purpose in motion, as 
men do, or does not at once give vent to his anger, 
but is slow to anger and in the meantime gives room 
for repentance, as Paul says, Rom. 2:4: "Or 
despisest thou the riches of his lovingkindness and 
longsuffering?" 2c. This kind of God the wicked do 
not know, but, being caught up in present things, 
despise the threatenings of God. For the Assyrians 
saw that they had devoured the greater part, namely 
the ten tribes of Israel, therefore they presumed that 
they would devour without any effort also the smaller 
part, namely the remaining heirs of the Jewish land. 
That is why they continue and decide to break 
through, guided by human advice. Therefore, 
whoever wants to know God must know Him 
correctly. Since God has great power to accomplish 
what He promises, it is necessary that He does not 
concern Himself with small things. Therefore, he 
allows the cause and the persecution to reach the 
highest danger, where he then shows his strength 
and his power in difficult things; as it is written of 
Pharaoh [Ex. 9, 16.ft "Therefore | have awakened 
you, that my power may appear in you." 


Before which no one is innocent. ") 


According to the Hebrew: Innocentans non in- 
nocentabit. It is a Hebrew way of speaking: 


m) Hezekiah trembled. There was nothing before his eyes here but 
disturbance, and worse than that which took place in the kingdom of 
Israel. 

n) Or like this: He will afflict him and will not find him innocent. All 
this is for our consolation. - And this is our consolation against the 
princes and bishops. My cause is just, however much it is 
condemned; on the other hand, their cause is condemned, however 
much it is thought to be just. Our innocence must be suppressed and 
known to God alone, but condemned in the world. 


1Z80 D- xxvn, i2-i4. Interpretation of Nahum (2.), cap. 


1,3. 4. 1381 





he will not consider innocent, or: he will not find 
innocent. A similar Hebrew idiom is Ps. 49:8 
[according to the Hebrew]: a redeeming brother 
cannot redeem, for which we simply say, "A brother 
cannot redeem." So here it should simply have been 
said: he will not make innocent or reckon innocent. °) 
The same is what Moses says Ex. 34:7: "Before whom 
no man is innocent." So he says here: When God shall 
visitation upon his adversaries, he shall count no man 
innocent. °) For the adversaries boasted of their 
innocence, and that they persecuted the people of 
Israel by God's command. For well known are the 
words of Sanherib Is. 36, 10: "The LORD said to me, 
'Go up to this land" 2c. This presumption and carnal 
certainty is in all the wicked, that they think they are 
doing God a service by oppressing the godly. The 
godly, on the other hand, are afraid, ‘therefore the 
latter have need of comfort, but the latter of threat. 9) 


He is the Lord whose ways are in weather and storm. 


r 


Here is a description of the power and 
effectiveness or the strength of God. ‘) For he wants 
to indicate that his power is so great that no power of 
men can be compared to it, as much as the powers of 
all in the whole world combine into one power. 


0) That is, he makes no one innocent. - The Lord is such that no 
one is innocent before him. He deals with them so that they may know 
that they are exceedingly guilty. 

p) First, "God" is longsuffering, "tarrying" with the wicked; second, 
"making their thing great"; third, He allows them to boast of their 
righteousness and holiness. "Where will we go out?" He does not do 
otherwise, but when he comes, he considers no one innocent. "When 
he turns the page," then we see what kind of God we have had. 

q) "want to be pious about it, indeed they must be holy." r) That 
is, he breaks through, no one can resist him. 
s) As if to say: The vengeance of God on the adversaries is greater 
than we could think of or desire. Our vengeance is a straw, God 
avenges in such a way that he cannot be resisted with any advice. His 
vengeance is, as it were, a storm and a weather, which, when it comes, 
shakes heaven and earth. Where are the powers of men then? Then 
all will be terrified, even if there were a hundred worlds. - These are 
mighty words of threat against the great empire of the Assyrians and 
a consolation for the small people. 


unite. For he will not fight with swords or weapons 
according to the ways of men, but his ways are in 
storm and weather, so that the whole world will 
blanch and tremble with terror when he comes. 


And under his feet thick dust. 


That is, when he walks along, a cloud seems to 
come out of the dust of his feet, "so that it even dusts 
behind him like a cloud," as cows do when they enter 
the city, or a storm tears the dust here and there by 
its impetuosity and whirls it around. 


V. 4. who chides the sea and makes it dry. 


From the happened event he proves the 
greatness of the divine power,' ) as if he wanted to 
say: You will have such a God who can dry up the 
sea. What is impossible in the nature of things is 
possible for him. And in this way he seeks to raise the 
weak hearts of the afflicted people to trust in God 
alone, so that they will have such confidence in God: 
since he did this in the past, why should he not do it 
today as well? And this is the right custom of the 
miracles of God. Therefore it is said in the Psalm [Ps. 
119, 52.], "O Lord, when | remember how thou hast 
judged from the world, | am comforted." 


And all the water dried up. 


He can make the rivers a desert without water, in 
turn turn the arid land into water lakes 2c. “) 


Basan and Carmel pine away. 


From known and neighboring places he takes a 
general saying and exhortation, as if to say: From 
those places which are exceedingly rich in pastures 
and trees, he can make barren fields 


t) This is the example of the Red Sea, as if he wanted to say: God 
once made the sea dry, "how do you think about the journeyman? If 
he did it once, he will be able to do it more often. Why then, O Judah, 
do you mistrust your powers? See what kind of God you have! - He 
covers the examples and makes them general descriptions. 

u) They are simple histories, not allegories. - Once he made the 
Jordan dry 2c.

that Bashan also has its name from fatness. But if 
God does not give them prosperity, they immediately 
become barren.

the Lord is good and mild, "lovely and kind" to comfort 
in time of need. For just as he is hard and severe? ) 
on the wicked who abuse the things that go 
according to their will, so on the other hand he treats 
kindly the godly who are oppressed by adversity. 
Therefore, as often as a tribulation comes, the eyes 
must not be directed to the misfortune, but to the 
goodness and the gracious will of God. But this 
kindness is not perceived apart from the affliction. 
God does comfort, but appropriately it is added: "in 
time of trouble" or tribulation. He is indeed a helper, 
but at the right time; he would be there at the wrong 
time if there were no misery. Hence it is said in the 
50th Psalm, v. 15, "Call upon me in time of trouble, 
and | will deliver thee." This saying is to be 
understood as lifting up the consciences of those 
who have wavered, either through sins® ) or through 
some other adversity, so that in this tribulation they 
may have a lovely sight or spectacle, namely the 
goodness and will of God, that they may know that it 
is through God's good will that they are thrown into 
this misery. Blessed are those who believe this for 
certain, namely that the Lord is good and kind, since 
the tribulation will serve them for the best. 


And know them that trust in him. ‘) 


This is the nature of God, who neither sleeps nor 
slumbers, but watches everywhere, has a watchful 
eye everywhere and cares for His own. °) Therefore 
the believer is sure that God has a watchful eye on 
him, who said [Ps. 91, 15]: "lam with him in trouble", 
likewise [Ps. 1, 6?: "The Lord knows the way of the 
righteous," ) but the way of the wicked perishes."

e) Sin is not sin if it is not buried and dead, that is, if it is not felt in 
the conscience. Tribulation and death awaken sin and the power of 
sin. Therefore, man should then turn his heart and mind away from 
sin and look to the goodness of God.

V. 8. when the flood overflows. ') 


These are words full of consolation, since he says 
that this affliction should not last long. But it is 
"overflowing" that we are overwhelmed with 
innumerable troubles "when a great evil or 
misfortune overtakes us". Thus it is said in Isaiah, 
Cap. 28, 18: "When a flood comes, it will crush you." 
1) Likewise in the 32nd Psalm, v. 6: "Therefore, 
when great floods of water come, they will not reach 
the same." But this increases the courage and 
restores it, that he says it will not be a continual flood, 
but a temporary one. "It rushes over." /) So it is said 
in Proverbs 2) [Cap. 10, 25.], "The wicked is like a 
weather that rushes over," but to our eyes it appears 
quite differently. 


Thus he puts an end to

That is, it is he who will put an end to the flood of 
misfortune, for he is the Savior of all. - loci ejus,* ) 
that is, wherever a flood comes upon the godly, he 
will make it flow away and pass over, if the godly only 
persevere, knowing that this has happened to them 
out of God's 4) good pleasure.

V. 9, What do you think against the Lord? ") 

After he had spoken of the greatness of the power 
of God to the terror of the adversaries, and of the 
goodness of God to the comfort of the godly, he now 
suddenly turns to the adversaries and says: "You 
intend to destroy this kingdom, where God's service 
and God's word is, but your remembrance and 
counsel, which is against the Lord, that is, against the 
people in whom the Lord is, will not stand, but will be 
turned against your head, because 


He will put an end to it, the misfortune will not come 
twice" ) (duplex tribulatio). 

Or thus: He will make an end, another tribulation 
will not arise, that is, this tribulation will be ended and 
Judah will be saved. °) There will be no second 
tribulation, namely in this war, at this time when this 
flood is over, because the prophet speaks of his time 
when he preached or prophesied such things. But he 
does not want to claim that no plague should ever 
come in the future. So you also read in the 2nd book 
of Kings, Cap. 6, 23: "Since that time the men of war 
of the Syrians came no more into the land of Israel", 
while immediately it is added [v. 24]: "After this it 
came to pass that Benhadad king of Syria gathered 
all his host together, and went up" 2c. Thus it is said 
here, "The persecution shall not come to strength or 
prevail," but the LORD will make an end of this 
trouble, which ye think against the LORD. For they 
had devised counsels which they could not carry out, 
that is, vain and trifling ones. For in the midst of their 
schemes, the wicked will become

by fire. Such a one is the great king, as straw against fire; 
so easily, therefore, will he be made nothing, as dry straw 
is consumed by fire. This is an extraordinarily hostile 
diminishing speech among the adversaries. But he calls 
the combined forces and troops of the Assyrians, which 
raged against the people of God, tangled up in thorns. -

V. 12 Thus saith the LORD; They come armed and

Here he addresses the words to the kingdom of 
Judah, so that he may comfort them, saying even now:

warlike, that everything agrees with each other, and they 
agree very well with each other, that nothing is lacking in 
the things that are required for an exceedingly good 
armor of war,® ) they still will not succumb, but perish,

1388 L. XXVII, 21-23. interpretation of Nahum (2.), Cap. 1, 12-14. 


Let them be handled (attondentur’). 


This [attondere] is a prophetic word, which is often 
in the prophets, as, Is. 7, 20.: "At that time the LORD 
will shave off the hair by a hired 1) clipper" 2c. 
Likewise Isa. 3, 17: "The LORD will make the crown 
of the head of the daughters of Zion bald." Therefore 
this shearing and cutting off is nothing else than that 
the people, who were around the king, should be 
killed. For according to the prophetic way, to shear 
the people is to cut off the people. For the hair of the 
feet is the lowest and the common people, the beard 


(crines) or the head hair is the noble and great of the 
king. The meaning is: "He will shave the king's beard 
away so smoothly that nothing will remain there." For 
this is what happened to Sanherib, king of Assyria. 
For after the people were killed by the angel, he 
himself came alone as a fugitive to his land. 
Therefore he also says: 


And go there. 


Or simply [instead of pertransibit] transibit, that 
is, he will go back, "he goes his way".

You have the same opinion and the same words 
in the second Psalm, v. 3. "Let us break their bands, 
and cast from us their cords." “) It is therefore "break 
the yoke and rend the bands" to shake off the yoke 
of dominion and loosen the girdle of kings [Job 12:18. 
Vulg.], that he [the Assyrian king] had no right to 
compel them.

V. 14. But against thee hath the LORD commanded 
that none of thy name's seed should remain. ‘) 

Here the Lord passes from the Jews to Sanherib 
and says: Everything that happens, happens 
according to the regulation of the word of God. "He 
has commanded", that is, he will accomplish 
something by his word, "that none of your name's 
seed shall remain". As if he wanted to say: Almost all 
the work of all nations you have harvested, that shall 
be no more. That is nothing else said than: You shall 
be king no more, you shall receive no more tribute. 
For all that is sown is sown by the king's authority. ”) 
For the bodies and the goods of the subjects are in 
the power of the king. The right of the king is 
described in 1 Sam. 8, 11. ff. 


From the house of your God | will cut you off. *) 

This was a very certain prophecy, which foretold 
such certain things about an uncertain outcome, and 
yet the thing itself confirmed the truth of the prophecy. 
For after he came as a fugitive to his land, having lost 
his people, he is killed in the temple by his sons, 2 
Kings 19:37. 


The idols and images | will make a grave for you; for

idols. For thou art worthless, that is, thou shalt not be 
buried in the tombs of kings, for thy body will not be 
honored; but thou shalt be buried in the house (eultu) 
of thy gods. That he was worthless and without 
reputation can be inferred from the fact that he was 
killed by his own sons, who undoubtedly did not 
tolerate this horrible outrage against their father, the 
king.

country, a new rumor is being spread, in which it is 
preached that the enemy has been defeated, the 
army has been put to flight, the besieged city has 
already been liberated. This glad tidings will make the 
defeated glad. For "behold" is the word of one 
rejoicing and exulting: "They shall shout hoia, hoia, 
and the shout shall be heard now and then on the 
mountains." You have a similar way of speaking Luc. 
1, 65.: "This story was all resounding in all the 
mountains of Judaea." The evangelist could not 
avoid this Hebrew idiom. - "Peace," "that it may go 
well," as if to say, "There will be joyful shouting in the

"The holidays" which you could not celebrate 
before, because of the presence of the enemy who 
threatened you with destruction; for he will not return, 
this useless man, to plague you, because he is 
completely eradicated. And the prophet does not 
speak of his time as if he wanted to indicate that the 
enemy will never return forever. For this would be 
false, for after Hezekiah's death they returned, and so 
this is said of the messenger of the present peace. 
Whoever wants to apply this passage to Christ's 
gospel in general opinion, may do so; | have nothing 
against it. For the gospel is good news spread 
throughout the world, by which is announced the 
forgiveness of sins, victory over death, Satan and hell, 
and peace of conscience, and that now this feast is to 
be celebrated with joy of heart, and the vows are to 
be paid with thanksgiving. This feast, being weighed 
down with the burden of the law, we could not keep 
under the law, nor give thanks with a voluntary heart 
from the bottom of the heart. But "paying the vow" is 
nothing other than praising and thanking God for the 
benefits received. "For the devil will come upon you 
no more," that is, the devil with the whole host of hell 
has no right over you forever. For death is swallowed 
up forever, Isa. 25, 1) 8. and the great supper is 
prepared, a fat meal, for a fatted calf is killed, Christ, 
2c.

The second chapter. 


Here he begins to describe the captivity of 
Nineveh and to depict it, as it were, before their eyes. 
And what the prophet had seen through the spirit in 
the heart as future, he presents here before their 
eyes as it were a present thing, because of the 
certainty. 


V. 2. the scattered will come up against you. 


[Instead of: Ascendit, qui dispergat coram te) it 
should rather read: For the disperser is coming up 
against you, that is, the king of the Chaldeans, 
Nebuchadnezzar. For your troops, which you will 
send out of the city, he will scatter and drive them 
apart. 


And besiege the fortresses. 
That is, he will lock you in by siege and deny you 
exit. 


But yes, berenne the roads probably. 

Now he mocks them, as if to say, "Prepare now 
the shield watch and be (bit) careful." For you know 
that this is the custom in war, that scouts are 
appointed to watch the crossroads and the roads, so 
that the enemy does not bypass them with deceit. 


Equip yourself in the best way and strengthen 
yourself in the most powerful way. 

That is, exert your forces, show your strength, now 
act manly, "now be strong and bold". In this way he 
shakes up the Assyrians who are in misfortune. 


V. 3: For the LORD will reward the stewardship of 
Jacob as he rewarded the stewardship of Israel. 

According to the Hebrew, rather: for he has 
quieted or subdued the hope of Jacob. The prophet, 
mindful of the reproach of the adversaries, brings it 
back upon their necks. For they reproached them, 
saying, The Lord hath quieted the hope, that is, the 
glory and the splendor of Jacob. 





kobs, he did not make the glory of Israel cease or be 
silent. But the kingdom of Israel had already been 
devastated by the Assyrians and the ten tribes had 
been led away to Assyria. But that "hope" here means 
the splendor and glory of the kingdom is clear from 
Exodus 15:1 (according to the Hebrew): "He acted 
hopefully" 1) 2c. It is therefore here the repetition of 
the boasting and the blasphemy of the Assyrians, just 
as if they said: The glory and all splendor of Israel we 
have turned into disgrace by disturbing the kingdom, 
in the same way we want to do it also with the 
kingdom of Judah. This impious and blasphemous 
speech he now puts upon them. 


_ For the rejecters will pick them off and spoil their 
fiber. 

So it should read: Since the disturbers had 
disturbed them® ) and had corrupted their fathers 


(propagines), But the "fathers" he calls the 
descendants and the generation, which is reproduced 


after the manner of the seedlings (propaginum). So 
also the people of Israel is compared to a vine, Ps. 
80, 9. 12.: "Thou hast brought forth a vine out of 
Egypt, and hast forsaken the heathen, and planted it" 
2c. "Thou hast spread out his plant unto the sea, and 


his branches (propagines) unto the waters." He wants 
to say here therefore: The Assyrian has left no 
remains in the country Israel. 


V. 4. The shields of his mighty men are red,° ) his 
army looks like purple, his chariots shine like fire when 
he wants to strike. 


Here he now begins to describe the armor of the 
king of the Chaldeans, Nebucadnezzar, and presents 
this army with terrifying words as if it were present.

Since he says that all weapons and all war 
equipment are of red color, he threatens bloodshed 
and indicates blood by the color. And the chariots are 
like torches in their impetuosity, "it all wants to be 
fire". For the shields and the chariots give and show 
a kind of image of flying torches, "they therefore 
flutter as fiery torches". 


Lift your skewers. 


[Instead of et agitatores consopiti sunt, it should 
read: And the spears are brandished, or: the lance 
bearers brandish their spears, that is, they shake the 
spears, so that they instill terror in all and despair of 
salvation by their warlike behavior, since the spears 
are moved and tremble in the hands of the men of 
war. 


V. 5. The chariots roll along the alleys. 


[Instead of in itineribus conturbati sunt] it should 
read thus: on the roads or on their course they are in 
confusion, "they do not go along after the line, as the 
peasants go to market," but go along as it were 
furiously without order, and keep no line. "With heaps 
they fall along." 


And rattle on the streets. 


[Instead of quadrigae collisae sunt in plateis] it 
should read: They rattle in the streets, namely before 
their crowd and violent impetuosity they make noise 
and rage against you. 


They look like torches and drive under each other 
like lightning. 


[Instead of Aspectus eorum quasi lampades, 


quasi fulgura discurrentia] it should read: They look 
like torches and like lightnings striking each other. 
The prophet wanted to depict with very significant, 
full and emphatic words the fierceness and violence 
of the rushing army, that they crowd one against the 
other before great multitude and fierceness, with 
which they advance against their enemies, so that 
there is no hope of escape or salvation. °) 


e) All this is said by the prophet tor the comtort of Judah. 





1395 


Hitherto he has described to us the readiness of 
the king of the Chaldeans to make war on Nineveh. 
Now will come a description of the fear and flight of 
the Assyrians, and of their exhaustion in their ways; 
how the king will appeal to his heroes for help: but in 
vain will he undertake all. 


V. 6 But he will remember his mighty ones. 


As the Chaldeans approach, the king will begin to 
call his mighty men and say: Where are now my 
heroes and great men, who have hitherto done such 
glorious deeds in war? "Then it will come to him at 
home 1)." But the Hebrew word XXX does not 
actually mean a strong one, but a glorious and 
glorious one, "excellent." Ps. 16:3: "For the saints 
that are upon the earth, and for the glorious." 


But the same will fall where they want to go out. 


They will fall in their ways or in their footsteps or in 
their walking, that is, wherever the Assyrians want to 
go, they will fall. 


And will rush to the’ ) wall and to the screen, since 
they are safe. 


Or: They will build an entrenchment. The spirit in 
the prophet mocks the pusillanimity of the Assyrians. 
"Ei, how they give heel money and beat with the 
heels behind them!" They are so fearful that they do 
not dare to fight with the enemy, but run to the 
defenses and seek hiding places where they may 
hide. They stay inside the walls, they do not dare to 
go out.

along rivers that flow by or through them, as if to say: 
the gates of the waters, which are usually 
inaccessible to the enemy, are now opened and are 
open to the enemy, so that he has access without 
any obstacle. 


And the palace will go down. 
[Instead of Et reginae captivae ascenderunt, et 
ancillae ejus minatae ibant in voce columbae,

royal castle 1) is disturbed. "The temple he has 
crumbled." The temple or rather the castle, that is, 
the most principal building of Sanherib falls down 
without the hand of the Assyrians, or will be razed to 
the ground, that is, all protection falls away from it. 


Vv. 8. the queen will be led away captive, and her 
virgins will groan like doves and beat their breasts. 2) 


It is said thus: Et reginae captivae ascenderunt, et 
ancillae ejus minatae ibant in voce columbae, 


tympanisantes super corda sua. "How mocking is the 
prophet!" The prophet mocks captive Nineveh with 
bitter derision, saying, "The queen who was once 
exalted in glory and splendor is now exalted in 
shame and disgrace. As if he wanted to say: 
"Women's shreds, 3) come up, let yourselves be 
seen." But they are called queens because they are 
wont to stand with their kings, Ps. 45:10: "The queen 
standeth at thy right hand" 2c. And the maidservants 
or servants shall beat upon their breasts, "they shall 
fell 4) upon the breast." Whereas before they 
performed round dances with timpani and zithers in 
great joy and delight, they will now be led away into 
harsh captivity, and will go by beating their chests, 
not unlike the way one beats timpani. This is a bitter 
mockery of the spirit, because this is the

Meaning of the Hebrew word that it indicates 
"cramming," as can be seen from Ps. 68:26: "Among 
the maidservants who cram." 


V. 9. For Nineveh is like a pool of water. °) 

He compares the captured and devastated city to 
a pond whose water, when opened, runs away and 
flows away. Thus the people flee, since the city is 
destroyed, "as when one cuts off a pond, the water 
rushes away" 2c. 


But the same will have to pass away. Stand, stand 
(they will shout); but no one will turn back. ") 

That is, all will seek their salvation, not in arms, but 
in flight, but even if they are called or recalled from 
fleeing, they will not obey that they should return. 


V. 10: So steal silver, steal gold. 

The Assyrians had snatched goods from almost all 
peoples and kingdoms. Now they themselves are 
open to the enemies for booty. For the empires are 
nothing else than mountains of robbers [Ps. 76, 5] or 


mighty plunderers ([montes] praedationum), and the 
princes of the thieves are companions [lIs. 1, 23]. 
Augustine says: Great empires are nothing else than 
great bands of robbers. 


For here is no end of treasures, and the quantity’ ) 
of all delicious gems. 

It is said: "There is no end of goods, that is, of 
portable things; it alone is full of precious jewels. The 
prophet continues with his mockery, saying: "So 
great is the wealth that is gathered in this city that the 
city is hardly able to contain such great wealth. "Dear, 
make a little room in the city, it is too full." As the 
robbers of the merchants mock and say, "The bag is 
too heavy for you, | will make it lighter for you,” so 
here is the mockery of the prophet against the 
Ninivites. 

g) And Nineveh, its waters are like the waters of a pool. 


h) and they will flee.

1399 





V. 11. But now it must be purely read and plundered. 


[Instead of Dissipata est et scissa et dilacerata est] 
it should read: it is desolate, emptied, destroyed. 
Desolate, namely, because the citizens are expelled; 
emptied, by the taking away of possessions; 
destroyed, by the tearing down of the buildings. 


That her heart must despair. 
Instead of cor tabescens, it should read: et cor 
liquescens, that is, it perishes with fear. 


The knees are shaking. 


It should be called: and is said to be a shuddering, 
that is, a trembling in the knees or a dislocation. 


All loins tremble. 


That is, there should be no strength but weakness 
in the loins or backs of all. 


And see all faces pale, like a pot. 
‘Instead of Et facies omnium sicut nigredo ollae] 
should be translated thus: Et facies omnium 


congregentur in ollam or sicut olla. We have this 
figure of speech also in Joel Cap. 2, 6. | see that it 
was proverbial; but what it actually means | do not yet 
know sufficiently. Some say, "All faces will be 
blackened," that is, they will mourn and be saddened, 
so that they will also become black as a pot because 
of fear. But | suppose the prophet meant to indicate 
this: just as meat is cut up, thrown into a pot and 
boiled, so they will be weighed down, afflicted and 
boiled by constant tribulations and distresses. 


V. 12. Where then is the dwelling place of the lions 
and the pasture of the young lions? 


Here he sings a song of jubilation and victory of 
the exceedingly powerful king and his princes. But he 
compares the king of the Assyrians to a lion, and the 
princes and great ones of the same to the young 
lions, who have so far robbed all the goods of others 
and have directed their attacks on the property of 
others, not to 


As a lion, he robs and makes a prey of whatever 
comes in his way, and is not afraid of anyone's 
confrontation: so those exceedingly powerful princes 
have fattened themselves with the wealth of all 
peoples, which they had stolen with weapons of war. 


As the lion and the lioness walked with the young 
lions, and no one was allowed to shoo them. 


Instead of: Ad quam ivit leo, ut ingrederetur illuc 
catulus leonis, et non est, qui exterreat, it should read 
thus: In quod ivit leo, ut introduceret illuc catulos 


leonis, et non est, qui exterreret. The king had his 
walk in great security and confidence, relying on his 
very powerful and at the same time very valiant 
kingdom, not unlike a lion relies on his den. For ire in 
the holy scripture is "to walk" and to have one's 
dwelling place in a people; likewise, to administer a 
public office. Deut. 23:1: "There shall no man be cut 
off from the congregation of the Lord. 

V. 13. But the lion robbed enough’ ) for his young, 
and choked it to his lionesses. 


He persists in the parable: Just as a lion robs in 
order to distribute it to its young and to the lioness, so 
also this kingdom had robbed the possessions and 
goods of other kingdoms in order to distribute them 
to its children and grandchildren. "To the lionesses,"” 
that is, to the queens and most distinguished women, 
he gave the booty he had made after the enemy was 
defeated. This is it that he says: "His dens he filled 
with robbery, and his dwelling with that which he had 
torn." 


V. 14. Behold, | will be upon thee, saith the LORD of 
hosts, and will burn thy chariots in the smoke, and the 
sword shall devour thy young lions. 1) 

That is, you who until now lived in the light and in 
a great glorious name and dignity, will now perish 
with your power "in smoke", that is, with disgrace. 
And 


j) 66pit kutkaienter or raxmit sutis. - Immediately following: nseavit

Your young, that is your princes, will be eaten by the 
sword, that is, they will be killed to you. 

And | will put an end to your robbery on earth, and

The kingdom will come to an end. For thy princes shall 
be slain, the spoils shall be divided, thy power shall 
perish, even thy renown shall be diminished, and thy 
messenger, that is, the command of thy authority, shall 
not be heard, "thy commandment shall no more be 
heard." 


So much for the second chapter. 





The third chapter. 


This chapter is easy, only that the understanding of 
the words causes us some trouble. For the prophet still 
remains with the captivity of Nineveh, that is, the 
destruction of the whole kingdom. For the prophets have 
this way, that they repeat and double the same thing with 
other and again other words. *) 


V. 1. Woe to the murderous city. ') 


That is, you are cruel and bloodthirsty, one who likes 
to shed blood. For xxx has not only active, but also 


passive meaning, namely [that SanguinuM stands] for: 
who is guilty of shed blood, as we have said Hosea 4, 2. 
"There comes one bloodguilt after another",™ ) as if he 
wanted to say: You have killed many, so that the city is 
nothing but blood. ") 


Which is full of lies. 


Instead of Universa Mendacil it should read: which 
is completely lying, "unfaithful". °) It is the same opinion 
that is in Hosea Cap. 4, 2. is: "There is no faithfulness, 
no love in the land"; so here: You are all lying, there is 
no faithfulness. 


k) The prophet seems to take great delight in spirit in the 
disturbance of the exceedingly ungodly people, and persists in 
picturing the captivity and the disturbance of the great city. 

|) As if to say: Now your hour has come, since you have always 
been bloodthirsty. 

m) Ps. 51:16: "Deliver me from the debt of blood." n) You are a city 

full of murder. 

0) "You are an unfaithful city, one must not trust the other." 


in you. °) For the kingdoms have this peculiar vice, that 
they are tyrannical, unfaithful. 9) And since these vices, 
so gross and so obvious, prevail, it cannot happen 
otherwise than that God punishes them most severely. 
God tends to turn a blind eye to secret vices and does 
not punish them immediately, but He cannot overlook 
obvious ones, but searches them out. Therefore, when 
He wants to punish hidden vices, He first makes them 
obvious and brings them to light, as we see that it has 
now happened with the papacy. 


And [full of] robbery. ‘) 


Dilacerationibus, that is, one does violence to the 
other; one attacks the other's goods. He accuses them 
of terrible shameful deeds: first, he says that the city is 
violent; second, it is lying; third, there is no love. "No one 
does good to another." 


And will not let go of their robbery. §) 


Instead of non recedet a te rapina it should read like 
this: the robbing does not stop. The gluttony and the 
devouring does not stop, it does not abate, "there is no 
stopping of the devouring". ') 


p) What is said here in an affirmative way is in Hosea in a negative 
way. 

0) cruel, inclined to shed blood. fRom. 3:15. "Their feet are 
hastening to shed blood." 

r) As if to say: You are full of violence or robbery. 

Ss) rapina or prasau, namely of all goods. 

t) as wild animals are wont to do.

V. 2, 3: For then shall the scourges be heard to 
clatter, and the wheels to rattle, and the horses to cry, 
and the chariots to roll. He will bring up horsemen with 
shining swords and flashing spears. There lie many 
slain and great heaps of corpses, so that there is no 
ad of them, and one must fall over their corpses. 
u 

Now he describes the punishment after he has 
described the greatness of the hour’ ) and paints as 
it were on a panel the army of the Chaldeans which 
is advancing against Nineveh. “) - "The scourges 
flap" 2c. The charioteer is eager to drive the horses 
with the scourge, the clatter of the wheels resounds,* 
) "the scourge platters (,platz'), the wheels chirp", "the 
horses scream". He uses apt and exceedingly 
expressive words to describe the matter clearly and 
powerfully, saying, "The steeds cry out and neigh to 
war. "The chariots rattle", "the chariots therefore 
lute", for they are aroused by the Spirit of GOD 
against Nineveh. ¥) But they were not chariots of the 
peasants, but chariots of war. For they used to fight 
from chariots, as can be seen from the history of the 
kings. 1 Sam. 13, 5: "The Philistines gathered to fight 
with Israel, thirty thousand chariots." Similarly 2 Kings 
9:24 says that Joram was struck between the arms 


and fell in his chariot. - Flamma gladii. The swords 
shine and gleam and the spears flash. "The swords 
flash and the spears shine like lightning." 7) Here you 
see the power of the Spirit in the prophet describing 
the thing to come as if he were presently 


contemplating it before his eyes.-  [Gravitas 


cadaverum, "and great 


u) The number of corpses increased daily. - It indicates the bodies

omitted this as superfluous. 

v) and the debt. - This gloss is missing from Weimar's. 

w) and the future defeat. - This is the rule that when the Lord has

Heap of corpses]. Gravitas means according to a 
Hebrew idiom? ) the quantity and abundance, as in the 
first book of Moses [Cap. 13, 2.] it is said of Abraham: 
"Abram was very rich (gravis)® ) in silver", indicating 
that Abraham had a great quantity of goods. Thus he 
says here: There shall be a multitude of slain, and an 
immense house of corpses,° ) namely, from one side, 
that of the Ninivites, xxx means a corpse in Hebrew. 


Ps. 110, 6.: Judicabit in nationibus, implebit ruinas 


means according to the Hebrew: he will make it heaps 
full of corpses. - "And one shall fall upon the dead 
bodies." ° The prophet sees in the spirit many bodies 
falling on one side, as if to say: those who are still alive 
when the war breaks out and rages, they will fall over 
their corpses. 


V. 4. All this for the sake of the great whoredom of 
the beautiful harlot who deals in sorcery, who has 
acquired the heathen with her whoredom and the land 
and people with her sorcery. °) 


It should read: Because of the multitude of 
fornications of the lovely whore and sorceress," ) who 


has sold (vendidit) the pagans and the peoples into 
her fornication. Here he shows why Nineveh will suffer 
such terrible things, namely because of the 
godlessness and idolatry, which she has made up 
with the beautiful pretext of worshiping God. He does 
not speak both of the 


a) "not heavy alone, but great and heavy." - f "fullness "f or size. 

b) that is, he had much, the fullness. 

c) "who are stabbed and strangled". He describes the Chaldeans 
who fight bravely and courageously. 

d) That is, they will be constantly sallied. It is a description of the 
raging and continuing war. There is no end to the living falling over 
those corpses. There is no cessation in the falling of a multitude of 
corpses. 

e) This text reminds us that it must be understood of spiritual 
fornication and sorcery. 

f) namely, this happens. As if he wanted to say: All this has come 
because sin has risen to the highest and it was time to punish. Too 
great was the amount of idolatry and godlessness of this whore, who 
pleased to the highest, who joined many nations in her godlessness. 
The name of God "must" remain a cloak of impiety in the whole world. 
Thus the Turk, even though he is exceedingly godless, nevertheless 
prefers the name of God. So does the pope. 


1404 D. XXVII, 37-39. interpretation of Nahum (2.), Cap. 3, 4-6. 


For this is the name of the ungodly nature and the 
idolatry which many people practiced by devoting their 
goods to this ungodly service. 2) For fornication means 
the ungodly being and idolatry, which many maintained 
by devoting their goods to this ungodly worship. 2 Kings 
9:22: "Thy mother Jezebel's whoredom and sorcery 
increase." A "beautiful dear" harlot or a lovely or pleasant 
one she has been called because of the apparent 
worship of God and the pretense of worship of God, by 
which she lured several nations to herself as it were by a 
spell. The apostle says Rom. 16, 18: "By sweet words 
they seduce the innocent hearts. For it follows: She has 


sold (vendidit) the Gentiles into her fornication 2c. 


Vendere is frequent in Scripture. Isa. 52,') 3.: "Ye are 
sold for nought; ye shall be redeemed even without 
money." Rom. 7, 14: "| am sold under sin." Likewise 1 
Kings 21:2, 25: "So there was none so sold as to do evil 
in the sight of the Lord, but Ahab." ') So it is said here: 
She sold them, ) that is, she gave them away in error 
through her ungodliness and apparent hypocrisy. A 
remedy no longer has any place where vice has begun 
to become a habit. *) 


V. 5. Behold, | will look upon thee, saith the LORD of 
hosts, and | will uncover thy face unto thee; and | will 
shew thy nakedness unto the heathen, and thy shame 
unto the kingdoms. ') 


g) This city was godless and a despiser of God. It had teachers 

who taught ungodly things; these it feeds, these it keeps as deceivers. 

h) which pleased many very much, as it tends to be with 

godlessness. She is called a sorceress or a poisoner, because she 
had many seducers who seduced the people with beautiful words. 

1) Weimarsche: lAa. 51. 

2) In the original and in the editions: 327. 
The Erlanger has in the margin 1 Re.]. 1, 25. This is probably a printing 
error. 

i) But it indicates the avarice of the exceedingly godless teachers 
who take money and sell the wretched people. Ps. 14, 4: "They devour 
my people, that they may feed themselves." 

j) that is, it has attracted and lured many peoples. 

k) Ungodliness grew to the highest level, even the outward vices. 
There is no place for a remedy, "God belongs here", if the vice cannot 
be improved. 

|) He speaks extraordinarily poetically because of his great heart 
movement. - At the beginning of this section is like- 


1405 


He alludes to that™ ) shame, when the whores 
uncover their shame for carnal pleasure. Such a one, he 
says, you were, you whore, that you offered yourself for 
the consummation of every fornication," ) and "attacked 
with your legs against all who passed by", Ezek. 16, 25. 
"Behold, | will uncover thy privates,” that is, thy secret 
places, which formerly seemed beautiful and pleasing to 
all, | will make manifest, that thou shalt be put to shame 
and despised by all). Thus we have seen that it has also 
happened to the Roman harlot, so that what was 
beautiful before has now become disgusting after the 
light of the Gospel has been revealed, so that the more 
they excuse themselves, the more they only burden 
themselves with shame and disgrace. "And to the 
kingdoms thy shame," namely, that thou shouldest be 
bad, naked, and shameful with all. °) 


V. 6. | will make you completely horrible. %) 


Thus it says Ps. 107, 40: He has poured out contempt 
on the princes. To "pour out contempt" means to make 
them contemptible by the exceedingly bright light of the 
Word. 


And ravish you. ‘) 
| will set you down, and make you manifest to the 


whole world, "that you are the text of the Vulgate first, and 
then a Latin translation, which exactly agrees with that of our Bible. 
Therefore, we omit these. 


m) namely the carnal. 

n) As if to say, "You whore," you who were reckless, to any 
whoredom 2c. "Harp, thou impotent harlot, | will lift up thy shirt again," 
thou hast offered thyself to the pleasure of any. - As is carnal 
whoredom, so is spiritual, which admits all teachers. 

0) As if he wanted to say: What you have done for sin, | will do for 
punishment; | will expose your grave under your face, that is, | will 
make your ungodliness obvious, namely how ungodly you have 
acted. This is what happened to the pope when the gospel was made 
manifest. 

p) and what was pleasant before, | will now make disgusting. They 
must hear to their faces today that the masses, pilgrimages 2c. are 
nothing and have been nothing but frauds of the popes. 

(q) Your loveliness has become the object of disgust. - The time 
has come that | will turn your loveliness into disgust. - It is seen that 
this has happened with the Jews, the heretics, the pope, the monks 
and priests. 

r) As if to say: | want to make you a fool. - sOontnraoliisj rather:

either a great or a small vice.

foolishness he calls a disgrace, "a foolishness," as in 
the first book of Moses, Cap. 34, 7: "That he had 
committed foolishness against Israel." °) 


And make a monster out of you. ') 

In exemplum or in spectrum or spectaculum. That

Instead of: Quis commovebit super te caput? it

compassion for you, but all will laugh and dance at 
your adversity. *)

| will make it known to the whole world that you have been a fool. 
This is what moves them most, that their foolishness is made public 
and revealed. - Shame is taken passively, that is, that you are worthy 
of having shame done to you. 

t) He does this to all his enemies, that they should be an 
abomination and a terror to all who lived in the future, like Cain, 
Ishmael and all heretics. 

u) As if to say, | will make you such an example that everyone who 
sees you will flee from you, saying, "It is gone." 

v) Now the prophet mocks for the joy of the spirit, w) that is, who 

will have mercy on you? 

x) and will delight in your misfortune.

because the Erlanger also reads like this.

whose power and might was the sea.

As far as | can rely on my memory, | remember to 
have read this name xxxx (Mino) or No three times, 
which the Latin Bible calls Alexandria, Ezek. 30, 14. 
15. 30, 14. 15. Jer. 46, 25. This is one of the darker 
passages in the prophets. For he compares Nineveh 
with Alexandria, which was stronger and more 
powerful than Nineveh. Nevertheless it has perished, 
how much more will you, Nineveh, perish. °) But how 
this comparison can stand is still not quite clear to me. 
Because the city Alexandria in Egypt was, at least 
according to the name, not yet existing. “) How? if one 
understood under this name "No" an old city in the 
kingdom of the Mohrenland, as Saba was, which was 
situated at rivers® ). From this read the Josephus’ ) 
after. Or it was Thebes, which was famous and well- 
known by its hundred gates. Therefore | translate 
thus: Are you better than No, the artist,? ) or the 
breadwinner, which was famous by arts and 
surrounded by waters, whose wealth or fortune was 
the sea. ")-"Mohren was her power." It seems that this 
city, of which mention is made here, was the capital 
and seat of the kingdom in Mohrenland, since he 
says that Mohrenland was her power, and Egypt, 
which is neighboring, also brought her aid,' ) and 
Africa ["Put"] and Libya, all had joined together and 
united their arms, and yet they could not maintain No. 
How much less will you, Nineveh, be preserved. 
Therefore he adds and speaks: 


c) This is a conclusion from the greater to the lesser. No "was better 
than you", and yet it did not escape punishment. | believe that it was 
an ancient city and more powerful than Nineveh. 

d) namely at the time of the prophet. 

e) on the Nile 

f) Ill). 2 untiHuitutuni, BNP. 10?) § 2. Saba and Thebes lay in the

g) It is not populorurn. The interpreter has been deceived by the 
similarity of the letters, because it means a pupil, a nourished person, 
an artist or craftsman. 

h) and mighty through noble artists, "since good trade is" as in 
Nuremberg and Venice. 

i) As if he wanted to say: Nevertheless, she also was led away into 
captivity, as great and powerful as she was. Now if this one, who was 
the mightier, could not escape, much less you.

Namely, from the cup 1) of the wrath and anger of

For GOD is wont to make the hearts of those tremble with 
fear whom He will deliver to the enemies. For if the heart 
is trembling and fearful, then no forces are sufficient, but 
if the heart is courageous and valiant, then great forces 
are destroyed with small troops. 


V. 13. Behold, thy people shall become women

Here he interprets the above simile in general by saying: 
"There is no courage left. ¥) For men who before fought 
fearlessly with the enemy, stood fearlessly in the battle 
line and were not afraid of any man's attack, now have a 
heart like women,” ) they are almost lifeless with fear. 
Similarly, the gates will be open everywhere to the attack 
of the enemy, because there are no heroes or defenders, 
but fearful women who will not stop the attack of the 
enemy, and the fire will consume the bars. “) 

So far he has described the devastation and destruction 
of Niuive. Now he begins to mock and ridicule the 
Ninivites until the end of the chapter, saying: 


s) as if he wanted to say: All other trees must be cut down with 
axes, here such a work will not be necessary, because fear is in your 
hearts and courage in the hearts of the Chaldeans. He gives the 
Chaldeans the assurance of a very easy victory and ascribes a 
desperate heart to the Ninivites. 

t) That is, wherever you are in your country, the enemy will rage. In 
Hebrew it says: it will be opened by Oesfnen, as: rejoicing | will rejoice. 

u) You are not stouthearted. As if to say, "Your heart is gone from 
the Lord's judgment, so that you fear you cannot resist, even though 
your walls are the strongest. 

v) Women are fearful by nature; see the epistle of Peter [1. Ep. 3, 
7.P 

w) so that the enemy can go in and do his will. He uses the most 
bitter scorn against the hopeful defeated.

V. 14. draw water for yourself, for you will be 
besieged. *) 


[According to the Hebrew, it means this: Draw for 
yourself water of siege. Water of siege is the water 
which the besieged use. Y) For it is known that a city’ 
which is shut in by siege is most afflicted thereby, if 
there be not abundance of water. As if he wanted to 
say: Even if you try to get water in abundance, you will 
not be able to do anything. You can struggle, but you 
will not be able to get it. 7) By the way, if there were a 
vein of the blood of your fathers in you, you would 
break out, you would keep the enemy from enclosing 
the city by siege, you would not be able to resist even 
water in abundance, much less besiege the city. 


Improve your celebrations. 


Or, erect fortifications. "Oh yes, mend and rag, 
make good." Restore the old ruins, strengthen the 
bastions, yes, move every stone, but you will 
accomplish nothing. For your endeavors will be 
thwarted, and your efforts will be in vain. 


Go into the clay and kick the glue. 


So it should read instead of: Intra in lutum? ) et 
calca subigens. You have the same expression in 
Gen. 14, 10: 5) "It had many clay pits," puteos 
bituminis. But it is the mortar or clay or potter's earth 
from which bricks are made. 


x) "Hui, help yourself.” 

y) which you will need when you are besieged. For this is the} 
way it is in extreme times of war. If no victory is hoped for, then one 
resorts to everything. 

z) "Defy and draw, go on, draw, hui’." As if he wanted to say: you 
are not able; as if he wanted to say: you are indeed drawing water, you 
are mixing the glue, the mortar 2c., you intend to restore the torn 
buildings: your effort is in vain. If you were men, you would hurry into 
the field, you would go out of the city. 

a) "to the brick barn". 

b) where the kings who were beaten in the valley are mentioned,

And make bricks. 


Tene lateres should mean make the bricks® ) 
strong, that is, the kiln. The brick kiln,4 ) where the 
bricks are baked, means 2 Sam. 12:31, "He burned 
1) them in brick kilns." By these words loud scorn is 
indicated against the timid and fugitive, whose efforts 
he ridicules all by mocking. °) 


V. 15 But the fire will devour you and the sword will 
kill you. 


It should read: For even there the fire will consume 
you, the sword will kill you. ‘) Though you labor to

that you can accomplish, yet you shall not profit 
thereby; in vain shall you labor, for the sword shall

appeal to us, therefore these similes are unpleasant to us. 

j) You will be invaded as when a forest is invaded by locusts.

sicut bruchus, gravesce sicut locusta. If these 
animals, the beetle and the grasshopper, seemed 
gaudy to us, then the likeness would also be lovelier 
to us. But the locust is an animal that crawls and 
jumps more than it climbs. Its kind is described in 
Proverbs 30:27: "Locusts have no king, yet they go 
forth in multitudes." Therefore he says: "Hui!" 1) You 
also imitate the kind and nature of the locusts, and 
break into the armed battle lines of the enemies in 
heaps after the manner of the locusts. But you will not 
be able to do it. Thus he mocks the unlucky Ninivites, 
as if to say, "You will not go out against the enemy by 
heaps, but will rather be scattered and fly away, just 
as the locusts are scattered and fly away. ') 


V. 16. You have more merchants than there are 
stars in the sky. ") 

It should mean: Make your trade more than there 
are stars in the sky. There was nothing in your city 
that was not for trade. Merchants flocked to you from 
all sides with their goods. Now you see nothing in 
front of the general public. "Ei, how stupid have 
become all alleys from the Kansmannschatz, which 
were before all full." Be now a henschrecke, put on 
weapons and kick the enemies 


k) a harmful animal. There are many kinds of these animals. See 
what Jerome says. - "One hangs on another." The locusts have a 
marvelous nature; without leaders they keep their multitude together. 

1) "Hui" put by us instead of knee in our template, which seems to 
us not well possible. 

|) He sneers at them: "Hui! *Be also their great multitude, become 
many! As if to say, "You will not be able to do much more; you will be 
scattered and put to flight, and if there is a great crowd among you, it 
will be like locusts being scattered and flying away. - As if to say, This 
will not happen, for you are a fearful people, you are a woman; you 
do not cling together like locusts. 

m) He wants to say: You Nineveh, which was so strong until now, 
so populous and respectable by merchandise, whose was more than 
stars in the sky, which was full of goods like Sidon and Thrus: stand, 
you, which was so populous and much, now you are unable to do 
anything. Now shave thyself, "do thyself together"! Where are your 
merchants now? "How wide and spacious are your streets!

against it. ") So you see a beautiful depiction of the 
war and the distraught city. 


But now they will spread like beetles and fly away. 


So it should read: bruchus exspoliatus avolavit,° ) 
that is, you are beetles that fly away, not that gather; 
you follow the beetles in fleeing and flying away, not 
in gathering and coming together. °) By the way, since 
he said above: "more than there are stars in the sky", 
the figure of hyperbole, which is frequent in the holy 
scriptures,’ ) is like that in secular writings: Known by 
rumor as far as the sky is (super aethera). Who does 
not see that there were not so many merchants as 
there are stars in the sky? In the same way it is said 
in Hosea Cap. 1, 10. in the same image: "But the 
number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand 
of the sea, which cannot be measured nor 
numbered." Ps. 139, 18. "Theirs would be more than 
the sand." 2 Sam. 17:11, [Vulg.], "Let Israel be 
gathered together as the sand of the sea, which 
cannot be numbered.” Who does not see that in this 
way of speaking hyperbolic is spoken? 


V. 17. Your masters are as many as grasshoppers, 
and your captains as beetles, which lie down on the 
fences in the cold days;* ) but when the sun goes out, 
they are lifted up, that it is not known where they 
remain. 


n) As if to say: It is impossible; "one goes out here, the other there". 

0) namely, you have made your purchase trade more than stars in 
the sky find, but behold, the beetle is plundered and flown away. 

p) For the locusts fly in a heap. 

q) as in the first book of Moses by Abraham [Cap. 13, 16.]. - As if 
he wanted to say: You are locusts and such beetles, which scatter and 
fly away, the Chaldeans are the right locusts, which hold together. The 
Afsyrians, who should gather together, fly away like the scattered 
beetles. 

r) Now he explains what it is that the beetles fly away, as if to say: 
So it is. - Oustoaes, that is "the lords" (xriueipW). - xrubkeoti, that is 
"the captains". - euveu loeustaruru st,the beetle") or swarm 
soonAroAutio). - As if to say, | liken you not to the locusts flying toward, 
but to the locusts flying away. - "that encamp" or: that have broken 
camp. 

s) They cannot harm in cold days, but creep in the fences and are 
fearful; they hide and flee wherever they canm. 


1414 L. xxvii, 48-so. , Interpretations on the Prophets. 


1415 





Here he interprets what it is that the beetles fly away, 
since he describes the kind of the beetles or the 
grasshoppers. For the grasshoppers are in the habit of 
looking for hiding places at the time of cold, not to do 
harm, but to hide, so that they are protected from 
damage by the cold. But when the sun rises,' ) they 
immediately fly away, as we see this with us in the flies, 
which are troublesome to us in summer, but when winter 
comes, hide in cracks and nooks, so that they are 
nowhere to be seen, let alone fall troublesome. So also 
your guardians, that is, the lords, are intent on nothing 
else, take nothing else in mind but that they flee. ") They 
look for hiding places, not in order to fight with the 
enemies, but in order to preserve their lives by hiding. 
There is a bitter mockery and a great derision in the word 


"encamp" (castrametantium). For their fortification 
will be fear and flight, as if to say, They are so angry that 
they camp in the fences. Your fortification is nothing but 
fear and trembling. "Paper walls are poor walls." 


V. 18. Your shepherds will sleep,’ ) O king of 
Assyria, your mighty ones will lie down. 


That is, they flee to their sleeping chambers to hide 
and conceal themselves there from the disturbance that 
is coming,” ) and will keep quiet. They sleep from fear 
and terror of death, as Jonah was overcome in the ships 
from anguish of heart, from heavy sorrow [from sleep]. 


And your people will be scattered on the 
mountains, and no one will gather them. 


t) When the sun warms the air, they "become glad" and fly away. 

u) You find timid. 

v) The Hebrew word means "to lie down with the body". 

w) They do not go out into the battle line, "hiding" as when a dead 
man hides in the grave. 





"On the mountains", "back and forth on the mountains, 
that is in the land of Judah". For this land is mountainous, 
Luc. 1, 65. And there is no leader to gather the people, 
but they will wander about without a leader, scattered 
and confused. And your people are not united or 
gathered together in clusters” ) like locusts when they 
are gathered together, but like locusts flying away and 
fleeing. 


V. 19. No one will mourn for your harm, nor grieve 
for your plague. ¥) 
For this fear will spread over the whole land and it will be 
known in the whole world. The whole world will be 
spectators at your distress and calamity, and in addition 
to this, no one will have compassion on you, but all will 
rejoice that you are afflicted, and that [the Chaldean] 1) 
has taken cruel vengeance on you, since you destroyed 
all before by your power. Therefore he says: 


But all who hear these things from you will clasp” 

their hands over you. For upon whom hath not thy 
wickedness passed without ceasing? 
Instead: Omnes, qui audierunt auditionem tuam, 
compresserunt manum super te, quia super quem 
non transiit malitia tua semper? [in the Vulgate] it 
should read like this: All who hear your rumor will clap 
their hands over you, because there is no one over 
whom your malice has not always passed. 


So much about Nahum.

M. D. M. Luther's interpretations prophets Habakkuk. 


1, the prophet Habakkuk interpreted 


by D. Martin Luther.*) 
Published by Luther himself in German around mid-June 1526. 


Preface to the Prophet Habakkuk. 


(1) This prophet Habakkuk | have taken upon me to 
interpret, that he also may once come to day, and be 
seen what he hath in him, and what the Holy Ghost saith 
and teacheth us by him. For | believe that he has never 
seen the light since the time of the apostles. This is 
partly due to the fact that the Hebrew language was 
unknown, without which it is not possible to understand 
the Scriptures, especially the prophets, clearly in some 
places, and that the old and previous teachers, who had 
the language, were prevented from doing so by other 
circumstances, and took little pains to do so, so that it 
would have been fair and right, and also useful and 
necessary, for this Habakkuk to be interpreted clearly, 


the saying: as the nuns read the Psalter. 

2) St. Paul honors him highly and more than once 
cites his saying [Cap. 2, 4]: "The righteous lives by his 
faith" and uses it as a basis for his most beautiful epistle 
to the Romans [Rom. 1, 17; Gal. 3, 11; Hebr. 10, 38], 
and Lucas also cites it twice in the apostles’ history, so 
that it seems that he had no small reputation among the 
apostles. Although we may not boast about the old 
fathers, for God wants to have such a judgment of the 
persons alone, 1 Cor. 3, 21, we must nevertheless 
confess, and cannot deny, that we have more light and 
clarity in many places of Scripture, by God's grace, than 
they had. GOD 


because the last chapter, his prayer, which was in daily 
use, is both sung and read in all churches, but almost 
after the first chapter, the first chapter, the second 
chapter, the third chapter, the third chapter, the third 
chapter. 





*) After Luther had given lectures on the prophet Habakkuk from July 18 to August 2 in 1525, he published this prophet himself in 
German around the middle of June 1526. We arrive at this closer time determination by the fact that Luther writes to Nicolaus Hausmann on 
June 2, 1526 (De Wette, Vol. Ill, p. 114 f.]: "| would have seemed to brother Philipp to be burdened with the prophet Habakuk, but it will 
hardly be ready for printing within eight days." Dietz, "Wérterbuch zu Dr. M. Luthers deutschen Schriften,” p. I.Il, says: "L. had the Prophet 
Habakuk in progress June 2, 1526 (cf. De Wette Br. 3, 114); Oct. 14 it is finished together with the Proph. Jonas finished (De Weste Br. 3, 
129)." In the last cited passage, Luther again writes to Hausmann and says (1. e. p. 130): "lam occupied with Zechariah (2noknrinrn rasclitor), 
so that he follows Habakuk and Jonah." That Dietz misinterprets both passages of the letter, but that we are correct in our determination of 
the time, is proven by the fact that as early as August 1526 (as indicated by the title) not only a German reprint was published by Adam Petri 
in Basel, but also in the same month the Latin translation by Johann Lonicer was published by Johannes Knoblauch in Strasbourg. The first 
German edition was published in Wittenberg by Michel Lotter under the title we have placed above our text. In the same year, in addition to 
the already mentioned edition by Petri, three other editions were published, as well as two editions by Gabriel Kantz, without indication of 
place and year. Finally, Loniker's Latin translation "Vnno 1526. iVisnss VuZusto", which was included in the Wittenberg edition (1552) and 
is found there toin. IV, loi. 622 is found. German in the collections: in the Wittenberg (1556),vol.V, p. 335d; in the Jena (1556), vol. ill, p. 246 
I>; in the Altenburg, vol. ill, p. 418; in the Leipzig, vol. vill, p. 462; and in the Erlangen, vol. 42, p. 1. We reproduce the text according to the 
original edition reproduced in the Erlangen edition, but omit the translation of the prophet that precedes the interpretation, because it is 
reproduced in full in the interpretation itself. We compare the Wittenberg, the Jena and the Latin.

that we may also be thankful and the more fruitful, 
amen. 

(3) But before we begin the text, | must first build 
the way, (1) and make a common entrance, which is 
not only necessary and useful to understand this, but 
almost all the prophets. For this has hitherto made 
much astray in the prophets, that, when they speak 
of the Jewish kingdom, they break off short, and 
speak of Christ among them; and it seems to 
everyone who does not know their manner, that they 
have a strange way of speaking, as they keep no 
order, but throw the hundred into the thousand, that 
they may not be grasped, nor sent in. Now it is a very 
unfunny thing to read a book that keeps no order, 
since one cannot bring one thing to another and hang 
it on each other, so that it may spread out finely one 
after the other; 2) as is proper, where one wants to 
speak rightly and well. 

4 So the Holy Spirit is to blame for not being able 
to speak well, but speaking like a drunkard or a fool, 
he mixes them together and utters wild and strange 
words and sayings. But it is our fault that we have not 
understood the language, nor known the way of the 
prophets. For this cannot be otherwise; the Holy 
Spirit is wise, and makes the prophets wise also. But 
a wise man must be able to speak, and this is never 
lacking. But he who does not hear well, or does not 
know the language well enough, may think that he 
speaks evil, because he hardly hears or hears half of 
the words. This is exactly what has happened to us 
so far in the Scriptures. That is why we have tapped 
and imitated in this way, 3) and have often gone 
astray and hit another; as the saying goes, "He who 
does not hear well, rhymes well. 

5 First of all, it is certain that all prophets focus 
their prophecy on Christ, as St. Peter shows in Acts 
3:24. 3, 24, that all the prophets spoke of the time of 
the New Testament. For the whole old testament was 
nothing else but a preparation and forerunner of the 
new testament, 


1) build the way - pave the way. 

2) Erlanger: "spimme" instead of: sptinne, which is found in the 
Wittenberger and in the Jenaer.

just as a disciplinarian raises up the son of the Lord 
and prepares him to be a skillful householder and 
father; as St. Paul says Gal. 3:24. "The law has been 
our disciplinarian unto Christ" 2c. Now that the 
prophets punish among the people and prophesy 
much, which alone was valid and served in their time, 
so also that they have included kingdoms and 
dominions of the Gentiles, also performed miraculous 
signs, everything has happened to keep the Jewish 
people in discipline and to prepare them for Christ's 
future. As a Christian, we must do much, eat and 
drink, and cultivate other bodily works, not that the 
body alone should be sought with them, but that the 
body should be preserved and nurtured, so that the 
spirit may serve God here on earth in faith and the 
Gospel. 4. For so must we also do in Christianity, and 
in the New Testament, that we teach people to live 
rightly, and yet both our doctrine and life are directed 
toward waiting for the last day and eternal life, and by 
no means intend to remain here with all of this. 

6th On the other hand, when the time came for 
Christ and the New Testament to come, as the 
prophets had all said, and the people were looking to 
it, God did as is his divine way, and pretended as if 
nothing would come of it, and let himself be seen as 
if he wanted to become a liar in all the prophets, and 
devastated the land and the people through the 
Assyrians and Babylonians. Then the prophets must 
be held up and punished, as they did not speak from 
God, but from the devil, because the work and 
fulfillment of their words is much different, and equally 
absurd, than the people had understood. Take this 
example: When the people were sitting in the land, 
and had kings and princes, and were now waiting and 
gazing for the Messiah and his new kingdom, of 
which the prophets had spoken so magnificently, and 
had put the people off, just when they were most 
sure, and thought, "There is no need, and Christ will 
come," then the king comes to Assyria, and wins the 
whole land, and leads all the people away in Assyria. 
How fine is Christ and his king-

come rich! Don't you think that many will have said: Now 
the devil believes a prophet more, there are all at all boys 
and liars in the skin! For we thought it would be good (as 
Jeremiah [Cap. 14, 19] says of them), but it will be worse; 
we thought it would be peace, but it will be calamity. Have 
they not deceived us with their prophesying of the 
Messiah? 

(7) Yet there was still a hope that the tribe of Judah would 
remain in the land, and that God would preserve 
Jerusalem wonderfully through King Jehizkiah; there was 
still a hope that Christ would come in that time and peace 
[2 Kings 20, Isa. 37]. But then our Lord God completely 
destroyed Judah and Jerusalem, much worse than 
Israel: and while they were waiting for Christ, the king of 
Babylon came and made Judah worse than the king of 
Assyria had made Israel [2 Kings 25]. Dear, who should 
believe the prophets? What hope was there now, since 
the land was ruined and desolate, kings, princes, priests, 
prophets and everything was gone, only the peasants 
remained in the land, and foreign, pagan princes ruled in 
the land as they pleased? 

8) Does this mean that Christ will come and start a new, 
great and mighty kingdom that will rule over the whole 
world? Yes, it is called destroying and devastating 
kingdoms. Behold, they do not understand such a work 
of God, for it is impossible for the flesh and reason to 
understand that life should begin where life ends, and 
that honor should come where disgrace comes, and that 
kingdoms should become where prisons become, for it is 
too contrary to and above the sense, custom and 
experience of all the world. But God does not do 
otherwise, and cannot do otherwise, as the Scripture 
says of Him 1 Sam. 2, 6. 7.: "The Lord kills, and makes 
alive; He pushes into hell, and leads to heaven; He 
makes poor, and makes rich" 2c. 

(9) Now here the prophets had to work; there was time 
for preaching and comforting, so that the Jews would not 
despair of the future of Messiah and his kingdom. Here 
Jeremiah, Ezekiel, also before Isaiah, and many others 
had to be, to proclaim such things, so that it should not 
hinder the future of Christ, and whether they should 





not all would believe it, but some would be preserved in 
the faith and become partakers of the future Christ. 

10. One of them is also this prophet Habakkuk, whose 
prophecy is entirely to the effect that he preaches how 
the king of Babylon will come and devastate the Jewish 
land because of the sin of the people, whom God will 
punish in this way; but Christ's future will not be 
prevented or delayed because of this, but it is God's work 
who causes the king of Babylon to carry out this 
punishment (even though he does not know it), and after 
that he himself will perish; as it is said: The father needs 
the rod to punish the child, and then throws it into the fire. 

(11) For just as God works with every man in 
particular, that He lifts him up highest when He pushes 
him down lowest, so He also does with a whole kingdom, 
yes, with the whole world. Faith and the Word of God 
listen to this, that one may endure and endure such 
things. This is how it happened to the Jewish people that 
their kingdom fell when Christ was present. For 
everything that happened to this people after the 
Babylonian prison was nothing more than a short and 
hasty preparation for Christ to come when the land had 
been somewhat rebuilt and the people had been brought 
together after it had been destroyed, so that he would 
only find room and people to preach and begin his 
kingdom. 

12. 1) So this Habakkuk is a prophet of comfort, who 
is supposed to strengthen and endure the people, so that 
they do not despair of Christ's future, no matter how 
strange it may be. For this reason he uses all the artifices 
and devices that serve to keep the faith firm in their 
hearts about the promised Christ, and so he preaches: it 
is true that because of their sin the land will have to be 
destroyed by the king of Babylon, but still Christ and his 
kingdom should not remain outside, but the destroyer, 
the king of Babylon, should not have much happiness 
from it, and should also perish. For

It is God's work and way that He helps when there is 
need, and comes in the middle of the right time, and 
as His song sings [Cap. 3, 2.]: "He remembers mercy 
when there is tribulation"; and as it is said: "When the 
rope holds hardest, it breaks. Just as we Christians 
must endure with God's word until the last day, even 
though it seems that Christ is almost gone, and will 
not come, when he himself says [Matth. 24, 37. ff. 
Luc. 17, 26. ff.] that he will come when it is least 
thought of, when they will build, plant, buy, sell, eat, 
drink, marry and be free, 2c. so that some, though 
not all, may be preserved in the faith. For here is a 
need of faith and preaching, as can be seen daily. 

13) From all this it is clear that this Habakkuk was 
before the Babylonian prison, perhaps around the 
time of Jeremiah; and it is also easy to understand 
what he wants and means. 





1423 


But that some books report about Habakkuk, that he 
brought food to the prophet Daniel in Babylon in the 
prison from the Jewish country, has neither reason 
nor appearance. So it does not fit well with the 
calculation of the time, because, as much as the 
prophecy gives Habakkuk, he is older than Jeremiah, 
who experienced the destruction of Jerusalem; but 
Habakkuk prophesies about it. Daniel was after 
Jeremiah, and lived long before he was cast into 
prison. 

014 Now Habakkuk had a proper name for his 
office. For Habakkuk is called in the first place a 
heart-bearer, or one who bears with another and 
takes him in his arms. He also does this with his 
prophecy, that he caresses his people and takes 
them in his arms, that is, he comforts them and holds 
them in his arms, just as one caresses a poor 
weeping child or man, so that he should be silent and 
content, because he will be better (if God wills it). 


The first chapter. 


V. 1. This is the burden that the prophet Habakkuk 
saw. 

It is clear from the text that Habakkuk was long 
before the Babylonian prison, because he says that 
he saw the burden. For in the Hebrew language the 
prophets are called "seers" or "showers", because 
they see beforehand in the spirit and sound what is 
to come in the future. Wherefore also Isaiah calleth 
his book a vision over Judah and Jerusalem, that he 
should tell of the things to come, which he had seen. 
And Abadijah calls his book the vision of Abadijah; 
and Amos writes, that Amaziah hath called him, 
saying [Cap. 7, 12.], Thou showerer or seer, roll thou 
into the land of Judah. We must get used to such 
words, that in Hebrew a prophet is called a seer, as 
one who sees future and hidden things, which the 
others do not see. So also here Habakkuk has seen 
the future calamity over Jerusalem by the king of 
Babylon, and comforts and encourages the people to 
faith and hope. 





But why does he say, "The burden," if it is to be 
comfort? Because he comforts rather than presses. 
It is the way of the prophets that they call their 
prophecy "burden," in Hebrew massa, and, as 
Jeremiah indicates, it came from the fact that the 
prophets commonly punished the people and grieved 
them with God's wrath, just as it is necessary that a 
preacher among the people always punish, because 
the pious are few and the wicked are many. When 
they did this, it became a proverb, so that the people 
said, "What did he preach? So they answered: He 
preached once upon us, but it is always upon us, and 
it grieves us; as they say now, They make hell hot for 
us, and the devil black. Now from the same that the 
prophets always preached something that was to 
come upon them, they called their preaching a 
burden, that is, something that would fall upon them, 
and immediately hung and hovered over them, that 
would soon strike them. As God's wrath and 
punishment hangs and hovers every hour 


1424 En. 42, 14-16. interpretation of Habakkuk (1.), Cap. 


1, 1-3. W. VI, 3103-3108. 1425 





over the wicked, even though they do not feel it. You 
may read Jer. 23, 33, how they called God's word 
massa, which God also condemned and forbade. 
Because Habakkuk also preaches about the future 
punishment of Jerusalem (although he comforts 
more than he frightens), he calls his sermon a burden 
out of the common habit of all prophets and the 
people, because he is also the first to preach inside, 
and because he wants to humble and frighten them, 
if they want to amend and convert, and avert the 
future punishment. 


Lord, how long shall | cry out, and thou wilt not 
hear? How long shall | cry out to you about injustice, 
and you will not help? 


3 Here he begins to punish the guilt and sin of the 
people, because of which the wrath of God and the 
burden had to come upon them. And he began to cry 
out and pray to God, as if he were angry with God 
that he had been patient with sin so long, and that the 
people were so surely in debt; as if he were to say, "I 
preach a lot, but it doesn't help; my word is despised, 
and no one improves, but only gets worse and worse. 
Therefore | know nowhere, but that | complain unto 
thee: but thou also standest as though thou heardest 
me not, and seest them not. But Habakkuk does not 
do this to reprove God or to rebuke him, as the words 
sound and are to be heard, but to frighten the people 
and drive them to repentance, and to show how justly 
the wrath and the burden will come upon them, 
because they will not turn to any preaching, warning 
or admonition, or to any prayer that is made against 
them. 

(4) Hereby, he states, first, that he preached very 
strongly and tried hard to punish the people, but it did 
not work out. Secondly, that he had great concern 
and fear for the people, because of the future 
punishment and burden, and would gladly save them 
and bring them forward, but they do not respect 
either, do not believe that there is a burden, nor do 
they want to let go of sins. For it is the way of sinners 
that, because they do not feel it, they do not believe 
that they can be punished and reproached as they 
please. 





Vv. 3. Why do you make me see toil and labor? Why 
do you show me robbery and iniquity around me? 


5 Then we see that he speaks of the Jewish 
people and not yet of the king of Babylon. For he 
complains about how bad things are in his country, 
how much wickedness is happening around him and 
among him, and how he has to watch it and cannot 
stop it. Because of this, he becomes tired of his 
preaching and weary, as does every pious preacher 
who would like to avert punishment and make people 
pious. When he sees that he does not want to go on, 
but becomes worse, he almost repents of his 
preaching, but cannot and must not leave it, for the 
sake of some of the elect. 

(6) And this is done and written for our comfort and 
admonition, that we should not wonder nor think it 
strange, if any of our doctrines improve, or become 
worse. For preachers, especially because they are 
new and have only just come out of the woodwork, 
think that they should have hands and feet as soon 
as they say something, and that everything should be 
done and changed in no time at all. But this is far from 
the case. The prophet and Christ himself were 
mistaken. It goes like one says: You are too young to 
make old husks pious. It is the same with this good 
Habakkuk, and it distorts him greatly that his teaching 
does not want to become vain work and deed. 

The two Hebrew words Aven and Amal, which | 
have translated "toil and labor," are often used 
together, especially in the prophets, and we must be 
accustomed to them. For they have two usages. One, 
that they mean unpleasantness and burden, as one 
speaks in German of heavy: Geschafte und 
verworrenen bésen Sachen: Here is toil and labor. 
Thus the 90th Psalm, v. 10, speaks of old people: 
"When it is high with them, it is eighty years; what is 
above that, that is even and even, toil and labor," 
because old age is a hard, unhappy being and life. 
The other custom is that they are called injustice, vice 
and wickedness. And so the prophets use it when 
they punish the wicked and the evil, 


1426 Erl. 42, 16-19. interpretations on the prophets. 


W. VI, 3105-3108. 1427 





and call their evil nature toil and labor; as the 10th 
Psalm, v. 7, says of the end-Christ, "Under his tongue is 
toil and labor." And that is why: because false teachers 
and evil men with their evil nature and teachings cause 
much misfortune to others, as they rob, oppress, steal, 
press, seduce, and also burden and weigh down with 
useless laws and infallible works. 

(8) Just as we use the word "misfortune" in two ways: 
first, that it means a bad accident and accidental 
damage that happens without sin. The other way is that 
it also means badness and knavery. As when we see a 
knave doing something bad, we say: He will do a 
misfortune, that is, a bad deed, by which misfortune will 
come to others and finally to himself. But such a 
difference and custom must be taken from the occasions 
and causes of language and stories. 

(9) Now Habakkuk shows how it was in the land of 
Judah when he preached, that there was toil and labor 
in it, that is, no love, no friendship, no faithfulness, nor 
faith is among the people, but every man seeks his own, 
and presupposes over another, stealing, taking, robbing, 
and stealing where he can. 

(10) As he himself interprets it, saying, Why showest 
thou robbery and iniquity for me? As if he should say, | 
mean such toil and labor, where one takes from another 
what is his own, and does violence to him. For in Hebrew 
the two words "robbery and iniquity" are strong. The first 
one does not mean to rob badly, but to spoil and make 
desolate in the same way as one spoils and makes 
desolate a house or a city. By this the prophet means, 
as one spoils and makes a beggar of another, that they 
come from house and farm and all goods as if they were 
disturbed and desolate. As it is wont to go in cities and 
countries, where neither law nor order goes, and the rich 
and tyrants do what they will. Therefore also the other 
word is called "Frevel", that is, violence, as those ask for 
no right. These two words we speak in German thus: 
They do vain violence and corrupt one another in the 
city. 





(11) Yet here you do not see that Habakkuk reproached 
the Jews for idolatry or other sins committed against 
God, but only for the sins committed against their 
neighbor, that at that time there must nevertheless have 
been pious people who kept the worship pure. But they 
lacked faith and love, and were possessed by avarice, 
usury and injustice. Now God does not like any service, 
however great it may be, where one does harm to one's 
neighbor; as He says Hos. 6:6: "| do not want the 
sacrifice, but the good deed," and Matth. 5:24: "Leave 
your sacrifice before the altar, and go first and make 
peace with your brother. Because they corrupt one 
another and do violence to one another, He forbids them 
to be corrupted again and to suffer violence at the hands 
of the king of Babylon. For God's way is to judge and 
punish according to each one's deserts. 


Force prevails over law. 


Twelfth, he himself signifies what he calls toil and labor, 
iniquity and destruction, namely, that no right is 
protected or administered, and that one drives with vain 
violence. With this he touches the great houses and 
rulers of the land, and dares it dangerously enough with 
his preaching and scolding that he so touches the 
mighty. He should also have been condemned as 
seditious, as one who wants to make the authorities 
despised by the subjects. For this is what is called 
rebellious, when one punishes the rulers with the word 
of God, and does not let them do as they please, does 
not praise and honor them in their evil ways. Now it is no 
one's fault that there is injustice in the land, but the 
authorities, because they are commanded by God to use 
the sword and punish injustice, and they not only let 
injustice get out of hand, but also do it themselves. For 
where there is strict authority and justice is administered, 
what would otherwise happen must remain with the 
subjects. 

013 But Habakkuk, fearing not that he should be 
reproached for his rebelliousness, punisheth sin most of 
all among the mighty, and blameth them for all the 
calamities that were to come upon all the land. For, 


1428 Erl. 42, 19-21. interpretation of Habakkuk (1.), Cap. 1, 3. W. VI, 3108-3111. 


1429 





As it is said, he does not punish them for idolatry and 
idols, nor for common sins among the people, such as 
lying, deceiving, adultery, and cheating, 2c., but for the 
violence and injustice of the judgment; that all his 
preaching goes over the lords and judges, which also 
proves the punishment afterwards. For the king of 
Babylon took away all the great things of the land and 
left only the poor, lowly farmers and gardeners in the 
land, 2 Kings 25:12, as if God were saying, "The great 
ones alone deserve it, therefore they too shall suffer the 
punishment. 

(14) And it is common with all the punishments of God 
that the authorities are most punished and overthrown, 
and the people remain in the land. For the people must 
have authority and be subject to it, like a horse to a 
master. Now he does not much care if his authorities and 
lords are bad boys, so that another lord comes and 
repels him, and God says that he is more pious, or even 
so wicked. So that God's punishment on earth is almost 
the game of which Mary sings [Luc. 1, 52.]: "He removes 
the mighty from their thrones, and exalts the lowly." 
(15) For from the beginning of the world until now we see 
how he always casts off one king by another, one lord 
by another, and sets up others, and leaves the land and 
the people, without where he wants to destroy [the] land 
with the people, as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the like. 
So he overthrew the king of Israel by the king of Assyria, 
and again, the king of Assyria by the king of Babylon: 
King to Babylon, the King to Babylon by the King to 
Persia, the: King to Persia by Alexander, the king in 
Greek[land],the kingdom in Greek[land] by the Romans, 
the Romans by the Goths and Turks; the Turks will also 
find their pushers, shall the world stand longer. And so 
on, both in large and small dominions, both in 
emperorships and kingdoms, nothing is seen but falling 
away and sitting up; just as if the whole world with its 
authorities were God's tournament and mutiny, since it 
stings and breaks among itself, and is no longer valid 
except: He who lies down, lies down; he who sits down, 
sits down. And all this because of their injustice and 
violence, that it is their fault where evil and injustice is 
done in the land. 





16. But the devil, the supreme prince of the world, 
drives them in such a way that they do not use the 
sword, which is commanded by God, just as the world 
abuses all other goods of God; and yet the sword must 
be like food and drink. But God always takes it from one 
man's fist after another, and gives it to another for the 
sake of his misuse. So the sword and authority always 
remain in the world, but the people who sit in authority 
always have to overreach and stagger, according to 
what they deserve. 

(17) And this deceived and hardened the Jews, that 
they believed not Habakkuk, that they had not idolatry 
and idols at that time, and thought themselves to be 
pious, and to have a gracious God, that they were not 
aware of his wrath. As is the peculiar way of the people 
to this day, like all hypocrites and works saints, that they 
always think that they are the dear children above all 
others, and cannot believe that they deserve wrath; as it 
is written in Micah that they say [Cap. 2, 7]: "Should God 
have such things in mind? Should his spirit have become 
so short?" 2c. For if they had known themselves to be 
sinners, they would have obeyed Habakkuk, and would 
have reformed themselves with fear and humility, so that 
the punishment would not have come upon them, as the 
Ninivites do. But since they did not do so, it is certain 
that they considered Habakkuk a fool and a useless 
preacher, but considered themselves pious, innocent, 
and the true children of God. Just as we see that even 
today our clergy do, who, in the most abominable sins 
and blasphemies, think that they serve God and are 
pleasing to Him. 

(18) Therefore this saying of Habakkuk, "Violence 
prevails over justice," will remain in the world, and is also 
acommon saying, so that everyone complains and cries 
out about violence. But we should not be surprised, it 
must and should go like this, and is the right color of the 
world. For where it is right, there is no longer the world 
or the world's rule, but God's own. And if force should 
not prevail over right, then the devil could no longer be 
the ruler of the world, and God's rule would be vain. But 
God does not leave it unpunished, but just as the world 
does not cease to sin, so does the devil. 


1430 Erl. 4s, si-23. interpretations on the prophets. W. vi, 3111-3114. 


God does not cease to punish, and always pushes away 
one after another, and sets up others; as Daniel Cap. 2, 
21. says: "He moves kingdoms and sets up others"; and 
Solomon in his Proverbs Cap. 28, 2. "For sin's sake in 
the land there must be many lords, but where the people 
are sensible and wise, their lord lives the longer." 


V. 4. Therefore the law must waver, and no right can 
come to an end. 


19 That is, it is not according to the law of God, but 
the law must bend and direct itself according to their will. 
For here he strikes those who pride themselves on the 
law, and do not want to be seen to be doing anything 
against the law, but catch some letters and force them 
to interpret and give what they want. Just as in our day 
the sharp lawyers do with their strict law when they have 
wicked, loose matters, and yet they give the law sucha 
nose that the matter must become right and good. This 
is what Habakkuk means here, that the law wavers, and 
that all good things are prevented and cannot come to 
an end. For the right mind of the law is thrown to the 
winds and despised, and so they go away, having 
gained by the law, drawn to their mind. 

020 Now the world is full of them, and they are called 
pious men; neither may they be reproached otherwise. 
But God judges and punishes them all the same, and 
forbids them that it should not be given to them. Summa, 
there are few good things among the lawyers or jurists; 
as they themselves feel and confess. Nor do they [the 
good things] carry money, and [the lawyers] would have 
to be beggars, who are now all gold and silk, where evil 
things would do 1) in law. 


For the wicked overpowers the righteous, and 
therefore wrong judgments go forth. 

Twenty-one You see that he means the wicked wiles 
that are used in law by one against another. Micah also 
speaks of this [Cap. 7, 3]: "What the ruler demands, that 
will the ruler tell him. 


1) would not be there. In Latin: 81 MAILS eausas non 6886nt. 





1431 


Judges"; and the great merchants all speak their will, and 
thus afflict the land. For that he says here, "The wicked 
overrules the righteous," is what St. Paul says in 1 
Thess. 4:6, circumvenire, when one throws the other 
over the rope, and so surrounds him with wiles, that the 
righteous must be wrong. Now these are much more 
wicked than the public thieves and peelers. For the 
public thieves do freely against the law, so that everyone 
grasps and feels it, but these want to be pious, and have 
considered injustice to be right. And so they are two-fold 
wretches: first, that they do wrong; and second, that they 
adorn and protect that same wrong with law, which is 
worse than the first. For since Habakkuk says here that 
the law must waver and that wrong judgments must be 
made, he clearly indicates that those who act wrongly 
with law and judgment are adorning their wrong. 

(22) So we have now how it was in the land, that it 
was full of bad boys, especially among the great 
merchants, and yet so that they do not want to be boys, 
and so they damage the others with two kinds of 
wickedness: one, that they do them wrong; the other, 
that they also defile and do wrong to those who are right, 
and under the appearance of pious people are desperate 
boys. This is then quite grievous, both in the sight of God 
and the world, therefore God cannot suffer it, but 
punishes it, as follows. 


V. 5 Look among the Gentiles, behold and be 
amazed; for | will do something in your days which you 
will not believe when it is spoken of. 


(23) Here he begins to punish the aforementioned 
boys. And first of all, he takes away their defiance and 
security, in which they relied. For they relied on the fact 
that they were God's people, and that God dwelt in 
Jerusalem in His holy temple; which city also until now 
was sometimes protected by great miraculous signs of 
God, not only against the surrounding countries, 
principalities and kingdoms, but also against the empire 
of Assyria itself, which before had disturbed and carried 
away all Israel, but before Jerusalem, in the time of King 
Jehishkiah, with all the shame of the kingdom of Assyria. 


1432 Erl. 42, 23-26. interpretation of Habakkuk (1.), Cap. 1, 6. W. VI, 3114-3116. 


1433 





And on one night he lost an hundred and eighty-five 
men, and fled away [2 Kings 19:35, 36; Isa. 37:36, 37]. 

024 For this reason it was a ridiculous speech and a 
fool's bargain to the Jews, that Habakkuk and other 
prophets said how Jerusalem should be destroyed. 
They could never believe it until the hour when it 
happened; so firmly did their defiance stand on the fact 
that God dwelt with them at Jerusalem. And indeed it 
was not a small defiance, which reason could not 
forgive. There were false prophets who drew from the 
Scriptures sayings that God promised Christ in the 
future, and how glorious David's throne would become, 
and the like. About this Habakkuk and his like, who say 
the same contradiction, all must be liars. For it would not 
rhyme with each other that a glorious kingdom should 
be, and yet be destroyed. 

025 So Habakkuk meets their defiance and 
throbbing, saying, "Look among the Gentiles, see, and 
marvel." As if to say, "You look to yourselves, look to 
yourselves alone, think highly of yourselves, be quite 
sure and certain that God alone is doing great things 
with you, that all the Gentiles should marvel, as he has 
done until now; but now look to it and see what | will do 
through the Gentiles. | will turn it around once, and 
through the Gentiles | will also do such a thing, which 
will also be strange and weird to you, so, 1) that you will 
not believe it until you experience and feel it, but will 
consider my prophets, Habakkuk, Jeremiah and their 
like, as fools and liars, and will not think that it is my 
word, which they speak to you about it. Just as King 
Zedekiah could not believe what Jeremiah said about it, 
so he summoned him and asked if it was God's word, 
Jer. 38:14 ff. What more wonderful thing could God do 
than to destroy His throne, His temple, His city and His 
people through His enemies, the Gentiles, whom He had 
made glorious and preserved against all the Gentiles 
and promised to be their God and protector forever? 


1) Thus the Jena, Wittenberg and Erlangen: as. 





26 But with this he sufficiently shows that he will not 
let us defy any thing, but only his grace and mercy. For 
here you see that the Jews do not help that they are 
God's people, that they are the seed of the fathers, that 
they have God's law, temple, throne, city, land and 
people; nor that so many miraculous signs have been 
performed on them so far; nor that they have God's 
promise. Why is that? Because all these things can be 
had without faith and the Spirit. As the Jews had it in part 
2. But where it is had without spirit and faith, it does no 
more, for it makes the greater guilt before God. For who 
has much, of him much will be demanded [Lnc. 12, 48]. 
Above this, it makes proud, defiant, sure, presumptuous, 
hopeful people, who exalt themselves above all others 
who do not have it, and want to be God's people and His 
own alone, despising and condemning all others. God 
does not like that, that one defies something else than 
His grace, and lets it fail, with all those who defy it. But 
flesh and blood cannot believe this, it is much too 
strange for them, their defiance is too sure, until they 
experience it; as happens to the Jews here. For they did 
not respect the faith and the spirit, and thought that such 
things should be enough for them to be called God's 
people and to be protected. 3) They perish completely 
because of this. 

27 All these things are said unto us also, who have 
the name and appearance of Christians, and boast of 
baptism, or spiritual state, and office, above the Gentiles 
and Jews; and are, yet without faith and spirit, as well as 
they: that, of course, we also must perish at the last by 
them whom we now despise, and had worse than 
ourselves; aS was done unto the Jews by the 
Chaldeans. 

The question here is: how does this rhyme with this 
text, since St. Paul Apost. 13, 40. 41. introduces this 
saying thus: "Take heed lest that which is spoken in the 
prophets come upon you: Look, you despisers, and 
marvel, and perish. For, behold, | do a thing in your days, 
which ye do not know.

if any man shall tell you." Which St. Paul undoubtedly 
says of Christ's resurrection, as the text there enforces; 
which the Jews do not believe to this day. But Habakkuk 
speaks it of the disturbance of the land by the king of 
Babylon in the future, because of the sin of the people, 
as we see clearly in his speech. To this it is to be 
answered that this saying of St. Paul is used as al 
common speech in the same case. For one may well say| 
of any of God's works that are to come: Behold, God will 
do something that no one believes, sing or say it; for the} 
world does not believe God's word until it finds it in 
experience. Therefore Habakkuk needs the saying right 
on the great work of God, when the land should be 
disturbed; and Paul also right on the greatest work of 
God, of the resurrection of Christ, which had happened. 
For neither was believed. 

(29) Even as we have need daily of all the sayings of the 
Scriptures against the pope and the wicked, which the 
prophets have spoken of disturbing the Jews. As when | 
say: God has done to the Pabst that no one would have| 
believed, even if he had said it, and will still do to him that 
no one believes now, even if one says it, but it will be 
known. So also here Habakkuk wants to say: Well, God 
will do something that you do not believe, because it is 
said, until you realize it. But the fact that St. Paul says, 
"Behold, ye despisers," and Habakkuk, "Behold among} 
the Gentiles," 2c. makes it clear that Paul needs a 
different interpretation. There is nothing to it, the sum of 
the meaning is the same. 


V. 6, 7: For, behold, | will raise up the Chaldeans, a 
bitter and swift nation, which shall go forth as far as the 
earth, to possess dwellings that are not theirs, and 
shall be cruel and terrible. 

(30) This is the threat against the wicked, hardened 
sinners; but they have had their mockery and laughed, as 
it is said, even as the sons of Lot did in Genesis 19:14. 
Although the prophet makes it violent and great, and 
would have liked to frighten them and make them repent. 





VI, 3116-3119. 1435 


drive. For he says that God will not raise up evil enemies 
against them, but the Chaldeans, that is, the emperor of 
Babylon; for that same emperor was then in the 
ascendancy, and was always increasing. It is as if we 
were now to be threatened with the Turk, who would be 
too powerful and too evil for us; which is much more 
terrible than if a lesser prince were to do it in the vicinity 
of us. 

(31) And he saith, It is a bitter people, that is, a 
wicked, fierce people, which dealeth wrathfully and 
tyrannically with the land and with the people. For it 
wants to be feared and despised, and where one 
refuses, it twists [the Chaldean], 1) and drives through 
with the head. Therefore the Jews should be afraid and 
not rely on it, as if the Chaldeans were lazy or obedient. 

32 They are also quick about this, hurry, so that the 
Jews may not think that they are too far away and will 
not come for a long time. As if he were saying, "Correct 
yourselves, dear children, and do not rely on your 
thoughts, so that you think the Chaldeans are not 
celebrating so fiercely or are still far away; they are 
especially bitter and bitter to you Jews above all others, 
and may soon come. 

33 Third, he points to their multitude: "For they will go 
as far as the land," that is, the land will be full of 
Chaldeans, so that it will teem with enemies in the land. 
As if he should say: If you are not frightened that such a 
mighty empire is raised against you, you should be 
frightened that it is so bitter and angry, and that it is 
especially grievous to you. If not, let it frighten you that it 
is so swift, swift and swift against you. If not, think that 
you are so much, and yours so little, that they would 
trample you to death with their feet. The Jews must have 
been very sure and careless that the prophet would 
frighten them so fiercely and powerfully, for they trusted 
that they alone were God's people and would not perish 
like that, as has been said. 

34 Therefore the prophet continues and makes it 
even greater: "It will occupy dwellings," he says, "which 
are not his.

W. VI, 3119-3122. 1437 





that is, all your cities and houses, which they did not 
build, but you built for yourselves, and will not ask about 
it, nor will it help you that Jerusalem is God's city and 
dwelling place, on which the Jewish people relied 
heavily. But it is in vain, the Babylonian people will take 
everything, even if it is not true, because it is a cruel and 
terrible people. And Habakkuk finely puts the word 
"dwellings that are not his", not wanting to say even the 
dwelling place of God, as Jerusalem and the temple. For 
at that time it was very dangerous, offensive and 
blasphemous to say that Jerusalem should be lost, 
where God Himself dwelt, and the common man could 
not hear it. Therefore Habakkuk also avoids such words, 
and yet says so much that everything is understood 
under them. 


For it will judge and press after its kind. 


(35) Then he fetters the reason why the Babylonian 
people are so cruel and terrible, because they do not 
judge or sit in judgment according to any country's laws 
or customs, nor will they keep your law, but will deal with 
you according to their will, and will need victory 
according to their pleasure; they will not let you set a 
measure nor a goal, but as they are angry and bitter with 
you, so will they judge you according to their bitter 
resentment. And as it judges, so it will also press on and 
carry out its judgment with you; here it is called "judge 
and press according to its kind,” that is, according to no 
law, but as it is minded and as it thinks fit. For this is the 
way the fierce are wont to act: when they have victory, 
there is no mercy, no justice, no fear of God, no equity, 
no patience, no recognition of their own sin and 
deserved punishment, but only, like the wild wolves, 
chilled according to the evil will of wrath, and smelled 
themselves in the most horrible way. 

36 In our time, take an example from the bishops and 
the nobility, how they have smelled with all their might, 
and still daily take revenge on the peasants, and the 
innocent must suffer with the guilty, and do not let them 
be satisfied that they have the victory, and are again 
seated. That they 





But if they also realize how guilty they are, and with their 
sins also well deserved to suffer not only a temporal 
damage from God, as a small punishment, but also 
death and hell, as a cheap punishment, then nothing will 
be out; to the next brighter everything will be restored, 
and no punishment will be lessened, as if they had never 
been guilty of nothing before God. Why is that? Because 
they should have no mercy before God for their sin, but 
because their hearts are hardened, so that they do not 
see their sin, and their mouths are closed, so that they 
cannot pray: Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive 
2c., and thus finally perish without all mercy. Therefore it 
is not in vain that the nobility commonly preys on lions, 
bears, wolves and other wild beasts; it means their kind. 


V. 8 His horses are swifter than parrots and more 
agile than wolves in the evening. 


37 | have not seen Parden, but the countrymen write that 
it is an animal that has many spots on its fur: and they 
are more gruesome than the "evening wolves", which 
some interpret: Wolves from the desert. For it both in 
Hebrew may be taken from the letters. But | hold that it 
is evening wolves; that the opinion is: the wolf, which by 
nature is a ravenous, predatory, murderous animal, but 
in the evening is much more predatory, because he has 
not run during the day, and is therefore hungry for the 
evening, that it is said "evening wolves" as much as 
hungry wolves that have not eaten for a long time, as 
also Zephaniah Cap. 3, 3. speaks of the false teachers: 
"Their shepherds are evening wolves, and leave nothing 
for the morning." So Habakkuk wants the wolves to be 
fast; not that they are fast-running before other animals, 
but that they hurry, and it is easy for them to rob when 
they are hungry, and they tear and rob more mercilessly. 
Thus he compares the Babylonians to the parrots and 
hungry wolves, that they hasten and hunt to rob and 
destroy the Jewish land; but once again to terrify and to 
amend, to provoke the people with such a parable.

Interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3122-3124. 


1439 





And his horsemen come from afar, and fly along as 
an eagle hurries to the carrion. 


Here a little bit is left out in the text. For thus he shall 
stand: His horsemen spread out, and his horsemen come 
from afar 2c. And the prophet here pictures the 
Babylonian army before the eyes of the Jews, as if he 
saw it marching along. For this is how it is seen when an 
army comes from afar, that the horsemen are seen at first 
as a multitude; but the longer they go on, the more they 
become and come forth, as if they were increasing in 
number. This is what he means when he says: His 
horsemen spread out, that is, in the pulling they become 
the longer the more, if one admits how they come. And 
"coming from afar" also makes the bunch look bigger, 
when they move from afar, and one thinks that there is 
no end to it, and that there is still more in the distance. 

39 So also "they fly along like an eagle to the carrion. 
There he touches the fast train and run, as it seems to 
him who sees the army coming; especially when he 
knows that it is meant for him, he thinks that they fly 
immediately and come all too soon, before one can 
prepare for defense. So Habakkuk needs the art of 
painting here, that he paints the approach of the enemies 
vox the eyes, and shows next to it, how it is to the sense 
of those, to whom it applies, namely, that they think, it is 
with them nothing else, but that they must let themselves 
be eaten, as the eagle eats a carrion, which cannot 
defend itself. 

(40) There we see how subtle and plain the prophets 
can speak, and how they briefly, yet abundantly, strike 
out a thing. For that which another would have said in 
one word, that the Babylonians will come and destroy 
Jerusalem, Habakkuk speaks in many words, and 
actually cuts it all out and decorates it with parables. As 
one must do when preaching to the coarse, hard mob, 
one must paint, blaspheme and chew it, and try every 
way to soften them; it still helps as much as it can. But an 
intelligent man is soon preached to. So he stops even 
more, and continues to speak: 


V. 9. They come only to transgress, like an east wind 
they go. 


(41) | said above [§10] what "iniquity" means; in this way 
it is also to be understood here, that the prophet wants 
to say: The Babylonians come, not to do otherwise, but 
to exercise pure violence; justice or mercy is not 
respected there, guilty and innocent, one with the other, 
will have to suffer. As it always happens in a common 
land punishment, 1) that one cannot separate the 
innocent; yes, it goes most of all over the innocent. 

(42) And here Habakkuk remarks, that the king of 
Babylon hath no right against the Jews, nor against other 
countries, which he destroyeth, because he saith, They 
come only to transgress. But he that committeth iniquity, 
and goeth by force, doeth not right, neither hath he right. 
And this, of course, is the title of all the kingdoms on 
earth, especially those that break out in war; as the 76th 
Psalm, v. 5, calls them "mountains of mischief"; therefore 
they must also be destroyed in the end, as happened to 
Babylon and Rome, so that St. Augustine well and truly 
says: "What are great kingdoms but great robbery? But 
God still needs their iniquity, so that he can punish those 
he wants, 

The “east wind" is the wind that comes from the morning, 
which the Latin Bible calls ventum urentem, that is, the 
one that blows and is more harmful than the sun's heat, 
just as the wind from the evening is moist and fertile. The 
wind from noon brings weather. The wind from midnight 
makes it beautiful and drives away the clouds, each 
according to its kind. Just as the east wind withers and 
takes away the strength and sap of the earth and what 
grows there, so the Babylonians will come and destroy 
everything in all the lands. And as no one can resist the 
east wind, so no one can resist the Babylonians. Cruelly 
the prophet does it, and paints long over the Babylonian 
army to soften and frighten the stiff-necked Jews. 


It will gather prisoners together like sand. 


44 That is, it will catch many people in lands and take 
them away with everything they have,

W. VI, 3124-3127. 1441 





without distinction, both of the rich and mighty, 
unmercifully all in a heap among themselves, as one 
gathers hay or straw together. It is the Hebrew way, 
when they want to make a thing much, to compare it to 
the sand. Gen 22:17 God said to Abraham that his seed 
should be as many as the stars of heaven and the sand 
of the sea. 7:12, the Midianites were as many in the land 
as the sand of the sea, and so on. So here also: "It will 
gather captives together like sand", that is, out of 
measure much. 


V. 10: It will mock kings and laugh at princes; all 
fortresses will be a joke to it. For it will make rubble, 
and yet win them. 

45 He takes all comfort and defiance, so that the Jews 
will not rely on any human help. For though kings, 
princes, and strong cities set themselves against him, as 
Jerusalem and Tyre, yet the might and power of the 
Babylonians is too great, that nothing shall help; yea, it 
shall come to pass so easily, that he shall make a 
mockery of it, when they shall set themselves against 
him, and set themselves in defense. So no amount nor 
power of the people will help, no wall nor fortress will 
protect. Where he cannot overthrow the walls, he will 
make such a high rubble around it that he will shoot in 
and run over the walls. With this, the prophet refers 
especially to the city of Jerusalem, on which the Jews 
also relied, because it was so solid and well-preserved 
that much is said and written about it. 


V. 11. Then he will take a new courage, will go on 
and sin; then his victory must be of his God. 

46 Here he describes how the Babylonians will 
misuse their victory for their pride and blasphemy against 
God. So that they will sin, that God will have to overthrow 
and destroy them in the end. 

(47) For no human heart is able to do this, that it 
should not exalt itself and boast when it is well and 
happy; as all this is not only shown in the holy Scriptures, 
but also testified to by the Gentiles from experience. 





as the poet Virgilius says: 1) nescia mens hominum 
servare modum rebus sublata secundis, a human 
heart cannot keep measure when happiness is there. 
Again, it can also not keep even when it is in trouble, so 
that [it] should not despair and sink. It is too soft and too 
weak on both sides, but much weaker. Fortune to bear 
than misfortune, as one says: A man can suffer all things 
without good days. And again: It must be even strong 
legs, which should carry good days. This can also be 
seen in experience: to whom good, honor, and all kinds 
of happiness come to him according to his will, he cannot 
stop strutting, defying, prouding, raving, until misfortune 
comes and fights him; as it is said: good makes courage, 
courage makes arrogance, arrogance makes poverty, 
but poverty is painful, pain seeks good again. 2) This is 
the course of the world in its ripeness and circle, and the 
way of man; nothing else turns out differently. 

48 Take an example from the next uprising among the 
peasants. For the sorry example is to be remembered for 
eternity and never forgotten. Since the peasants got 
what they wanted, God help them, what defiance, pride, 
glory, splendor and all the courage and arrogance there 
was; there was no more hearing nor seeing, no more 
measure nor wisdom, but with the head through, up out, 
and nowhere on. Again, the same misfortune, how faint, 
despondent, and ruinous it makes the overlords, who 
before had vain lion hearts, there was no courage nor 
glory, but vain flight and trembling. But now the wheel 
has turned, and the overlords have prevailed and are 
fortunate, but the peasants have been slain, and once 
again there is no measure nor wisdom on either side. 
The overlords do not know how to cool their courage 
sufficiently; the peasants are so despondent that they do 
not know what to do. May God grant that no evil come of 
it, that both lords and subjects fail, just as happened to 
these Babylonians in the end, as we will hear later.

1443 





when they saw that he was so slimy and happy for his 
kingdom, and that no king, prince, city, or country could 
resist them, they grew in courage and took on a new 
courage (as Habakkuk says here), that is, they first 
became more defiant and proud than they had ever been 
before, for the sake of great happiness; they could not 
measure up, nor recognize themselves, nor give glory to 
God, when all his happiness was a mere, undeserved 
gift from God. Just as even now our princes and bishops 
do not give glory to God, that they remain, nor can they 
recognize and humble themselves. 

(50) But "they go on (says Habakkuk) and sin," that 
is, they pass through, boasting and defying, truanting, 
and going along as if they were now sure, and jumped 
over all mountains, and thus sin with two abominable 
sins, which shall at last overthrow them most 
abominably. One sin is the same arrogance that they 
practice against the people they have overpowered, and 
they tyrannize against them with all their might. The 
other is blasphemy, that they do not give glory to God, 
but make themselves believe that they are so pious and 
worthy before God, despising and blaspheming those 
whom they have overcome, as those who have been 
condemned and rejected by God and deserve it. So they 
run away and sin against God as well, so that they may 
burden both God and man, and become untrustworthy 
of both, and soon perish, which is what they are striving 
for. 

(51) The first sin, pride, committed against men, is 
grievous to the human heart; but the prophet, like all the 
saints, is much more grieved by the other sin, 
blasphemy, which they commit against God. Therefore, 
he continues to point them out and answer them. The 
first he calls badly by a common name and says: "They 
sin with pride. But the others he attacks with bitter and 
sharp words, and says: "Then his victory must be of his 
god", that is, he has not enough in his arrogance that he 
overcomes the people and weighs them down, he must 
also give glory to his idol in Babylonia, as if the same had 
given him such power and victory. Yes, yes, the true God 
of Jerusalem must not have done this. 


but, as a much weaker and lesser God, be overcome 
together with his people, the Jews, and succumb to his 
Babylonian God. This is the one whose great victory 
must be called. Where is the God of the Jews now? Just 
as 2 Kings 18:33-35, the archbishop of the king of 
Assyria said that his lord had conquered all the gods in 
the lands around him, and that the God of the Jews 
would not be able to resist him. 

52] This is what greatly perverts the prophet, that the 
wicked not only do not recognize their power and victory, 
from whom they got it, but also harden themselves in 
their wickedness, blaspheme God freely and surely, give 
to the devil what they have from God, and make their 
wickedness a virtue, and the people of God sinners and 
boys. That is why the prophet is so angry and impatient 
with this sin until the end of this chapter, that the 
Babylonians should be right and defy it, and the people 
of God should be wrong, because they suffer misfortune 
and those have happiness. 

(53) The Jews also defied Christ in the same way 
when they were on top and had crucified Him, 
blaspheming and saying, "If He is the Son of God, let 
Him help Him now" (Matth. 27:40,42). Just as if God was 
on their side and they were right and Christ was wrong. 
Then their victory and power must also be of their God, 
that is, of their devil and idol, not knowing and thinking 
that the right God had thus abandoned Christ and given 
Him into their hands, and yet loving Christ and being 
angry with them; as all godless tyrants do, and measure 
God's grace according to bodily fortune or misfortune. 

54. Just as our bishops and princes are doing now: 
because God has given them the victory against the 
peasants, and besides that they have many innocent 
Christians tortured and persecuted, they do not think 
otherwise that their cause is good and right and pleases 
God, are defiant and insolent, think they are doing God 
a service, do not think that their God and cause is vain 
devilry, because they see that they are lucky and the 
gospel is unlucky; but do not know that the same 
persecuted Christians' God and cause is right, and God 
has given them into their hands, as He did with Christ 
Himself and all the 


1444 Erl. 42, 37-39. interpretation of Habakkuk (1.), Cap. 1, 11. 13. w. VI, 3130-3133. 


Saints has done. Therefore they go on and on, 
blaspheming and saying: Where is now thy Christ? let 
him help thee. Then their power and victory must also be 
of their God, and they are right. This is the true Christian 
cross, that one not only suffers evil, but must also be 
wrong, and be reckoned with the wrongdoers, like Christ. 

(55) But it shall come to a desolate end with them, 
and when they have sown their honey, they shall be sour 
mustard. For because they do not fear God in his 
judgments and works, and do not humble themselves, 
he confidently lets them go on, so that they have 
happiness and victory in abundance, and makes them 
fools in their cleverness and conceit, so that they fill their 
sin, and harden themselves, until the hour comes for him 
to deal with them, as with the Babylonians and the Jews, 
and all such tyrants. For where are they now who said to 
Christ, "He hopes in God, who now redeems him, does 
he delight in him"? [Matth. 27, 43.] Where is their God, 
to whom they gave the victory? Christ has remained, but 
they have vanished and flown away like dust in the field. 

(56) We may take comfort in this now. For the hour 
will come very soon, when they will say of our tyrants, 
bishops and priests: Where are they? Where is their God 
now? Where is their precious, right cause? Where is 
their Christian church? Where are they who said, Let thy 
gospel and Christ help thee? But that they now conquer 
and rage, defy and strut, and give the victory to their 
God, as if God were with them against us, this serves to 
make them confident, foolish, obdurate, and finely ripe 
for punishment, and when it is already said to them, they 
should not believe it, but laugh at it, so that they will not 
convert and be preserved. 


V. 12. Who art thou, O LORD, my God, my Holy 
One, from everlasting. Let us not die, but let him, 0 
LORD, be only a punishment; and let him, O our 
refuge, chastise us only. 


(57) Here he reproaches himself with the sin of the 
blasphemers, and punishes them, and comforts his own; 
to say, that the Babylonians prevail and are victorious, 
but we suffer and are defeated is 


1445 


Not because the Babylonian God is a right God, to whom 
they attribute such power, nor because they are so pious 
and righteous, or because we are sinners and 
unrighteous; but it is you, O Lord, who do all these 
things, and trust us, and raise them up; so is your will. 
They know not this, and fight with it against thee, which 
thou givest them, even power and victory, and givest it 
to their god. But there are two reasons why you do this. 
The first is that you use their wickedness as a rod to 
chastise your loved ones, as Isaiah Cap. 10:5 says: 
"Assyria is my rod," and Revelation 3:19: "Whom | love, 
| chastise. The other is that they will run and become 
fools over this counsel of yours, which they do not know, 
and after that they will perish, as is said above (cf. § 10), 
and as he will continue to say in the third chapter. For 
thus one speaks: When the father has punished the 
child, he throws the rod into the fire. 

(58) So the prophet prayed that God would keep the 
punishment and not let the Jewish people fall to the 
ground, saying instead of the people and with the 
people, "O Lord, my God, my Holy One! For no people 
under the sun had or knew the right GOtt, without the 
Jewish people alone, therefore they alone could say, 
"my GOtt." But he calls him his "Holy One," as the 
prophets used to call GOtt the Holy One in Israel, Isa. 1, 
4.: "They blaspheme the Holy One in Israel." Psalm 89, 
19.: "The LORD is our shield, and the Holy One in Israel 
is our King." So here also: "My God, my Holy One." And 
that because they were holy through their God, and 
nothing else; as he says Deut. 20, 8. 21, 8. 15.23.: "It is 
| who sanctify you." Just as we now become Christians, 
that is, saints, through Christ alone, and nothing else, not 
through our work or merit 2c. 

59. Further he says, "O Lord, are you not from 
eternity?" As if he should say: Oh Lord, there is no other 
God than you, the old, true, eternal God, and not a new, 
false God, like the one of Babylon and others, who have 
come and been invented with the time. With this he 
consoles himself and his own, also defies and mocks the 
Babylonian god, whom 


1446 Erl. 42, 39-42. triggers about the prophets. W. VI, 3133-3135. 


1447 





the Babylonians raise so high. For it gives great courage 
when one knows and believes with certainty that there is 
only One God, and that He is our God, our Holy One, 
and holds with us. What can all the gods on earth do? 
Since you alone are God and our Holy One, and we are 
your people, so that everything is in your hands, have 
mercy on us and do not let us die or even be destroyed 
by the Babylonians, but only be punished and 
chastened, so that seed may remain for your people, as 
you have promised. For this prayer is based on God's 
promise, since He spoke to the people that He would not 
completely abandon them, even though He would not 
keep them all [Isa. 1, 29]. Rom. 9, 29. 

60 In Hebrew, this text ba, which can be rendered 
in German, reads thus: Is it not so, O Lord, that from of 
old you are my God, my Holy One, that we shall not die? 
In it, the prophet briefly summarizes and comprehends 
all of God's promises and miracles that befell the Jewish 
people. As if to say: Do you also know, or do you not 
remember, that you promised us to be our God and have 
never let us perish? So you will not let us perish now. 
For you are our God, in whom we live and do not die, as 
you have said to us. And what follows is attached to this 
passage in Hebrew, and may also be read in 
interrogative terms, thus: Is it not so, O Lord, that from 
of old thou art my God, my Holy One, that we shall not 
die, but use him for punishment, O Lord, and set him for 
chastening, O our refuge? 

(61) He asks God whether he will also do so and only 
punish; not that he doubts it, but that he may show how 
faith is challenged, that it seems weak, as if it did not 
believe, and immediately wants to sink and doubt before 
the great calamity that oppresses it. For even though 
faith remains firm, it still cracks and speaks much 
differently when it is in battle than it does when it has 
won. So it was hard for the people to believe that they 
would be preserved in this case of the Babylonian 
prison, or that they would always come back, and that 
this would only be a punishment. Therefore follows 
further: 


V. 13. Your eyes are pure, so that you cannot see 
evil, and you cannot see misery. 


(62) As if he should say, "Well then, be pure of eye, 
that you may not suffer evil, as it is preached of you that 
you are righteous, and leave no evil unpunished; how 
then is it that you do much else, and suffer such evil, and 
do not punish [it]? In Hebrew it reads: Mundare oculis, 
vel sis plane mundus oculis, et est amara concessio! 
) in opere contrario, as we would say in German of one 
who would be of good report, and yet would do 
otherwise: Well, you are pious, but how do you do so? 
should a pious man do this? So also here: "Well, Lord, 
you are righteous, they say of you, but where is your 
righteousness? 

With such words Habakkuk shows what thoughts 
occur to the struggling faith, which thinks that God is 
righteous, but he consumes so long, and watches the 
wicked, that one would almost think that he is not 
righteous, but has pleasure in the boys. Just as we 
would like to think now that God is persecuting and 
blaspheming our gospel so miserably that both violence 
and sectarianism are increasing daily, and we would 
also like to say, "You are pure of eye and do not like to 
see violence and injustice, but when will you prove it in 
action? Methinks thou wilt think us wrong, and them 
righteous, when we are sure that we are right, and they 
wrong. 

64 Not only the common people had such a 
weakness or challenge of faith, but also the prophet 
himself, as well as all other prophets; as Jeremiah Cap. 
12, 1. ff. also does, and says: "Lord, you are righteous, 
if | would be right with you; but yet | must speak to you 
of the right. How is it then that the wicked prosper so, 
and all the scornful are so blessed? Thou hast planted 
them, and they are well rooted; they continue, and are 
fruitful; thou art near their mouth, and far from their 
kidneys." And Psalm 73, 2. 3.: "My feet would have 
almost slid, and my gait would have almost strayed.

| rejoiced when | saw that the wicked were doing so well" 
2c. For it grieves us exceedingly that the unrighteous 
should suffer so long, and at the same time earn so much 
happiness through injustice, and the righteous earn so 
much misfortune through their piety. But all this is done 
so that they may prosper, and our faith may be extended, 
strong and rich in God. As Habakkuk also says hereafter 
of the king of Babylon; as also the above-mentioned 73rd 
Psalm, v. 18, says that God lifts up the wicked, so that he 
brings them low. And [in] Jeremiah follows swiftly upon 
the foregoing words, saying [Cap. 12, 3.], "Gather them 
like sheep to the slaughter, and prepare them for the day 
of strangulation." 


V.13. Why then do you look to the scornful, and 
keep silent, that the wicked devour him who is 
more pious than he? 


(65) Then the fighting faith clashes with the happiness 

of the wicked, and tells it one after another. As if he 
should say: | believe it, and | am sure of it, that you alone 
are God, and the wicked may do nothing without your 
will; why then do you watch and keep silent? And uses 
strong words. He calls the wicked despisers, which 
means the reprobate, secure, free men who think nothing 
at all of God's word and work, so that no man can think 
nothing at all of any thing, which St. Paul calls Eph. 4, 19. 
apilgicotes atnAynxotec, which we call "the wicked". 
In Latin: qui non solum contemnunt, sed etiam 
negligunt, quasi indignos habeant, quos contemnant; 
in Hebrew Boged. Just as we think of the Jews, and the 
Jews think of us, since one considers the other to be 
nothing at all. Just as some wicked people now think 
nothing at all of the gospel, that it is a joke to them, and 
have nothing more certain than that it is nothing. 
Such people, who neither feel nor accept anything, are 
called Bogdim and apilgicotes, wicked, so that there is 
no taste or smell, and everything is gone in their hearts. 
Thus the pagans write of the tyrant Dionysio, when he 
had robbed the temple, and got good weather to ship, 
that he boasted and said, Behold, how good 








God gives weather to the church thieves. Where there is 
no Christian patience, flesh and blood should wish that 
ten thunders would fall on such a one's head and strike 
nine cubits deep into the earth. We call such a one 
daring, who waved it freely, 1) and almost agrees with 
the Hebrew boged, or woged. 

67 Secondly, that God does nothing at all to such 
reckless, wicked people, that he keeps silent, and 
strengthens them equally, as if it were nothing at all, as 
they hold, and is also wicked about them, as they are 
about him, also does not feel, and does not accept 
anything, that there are two reckless people against each 
other, God and the wicked: oh, this is a displeasing 
silence to God, and an unpleasant contempt to the 
reckless people. So he also shows the Babylonians here, 
that they were sure of their things and bold, that they 
might have believed everything before, before they 
believed that God considered the Jews to be His people 
and the Babylonians to be His enemies. There was 
nothing more certain than that we Babylonians are God's 
children and the Jews are His enemies. They were so 
deceived by fortune; as it is with all the wicked. 

Now, this is not yet beyond measure, when a prophet 
is to stand for himself in such fighting faith; but when he 
enters his office, and is to comfort and sustain a whole 
people in the same fight with him, there is trouble, 
lamentation and distress; there the people wriggle, and 
hardly two or three in the whole crowd shall believe and 
fight with him, the others all get angry at the bold tyrant, 
and think: Oh, it is nothing with us, God is against us. Do 
you not see how he lifts and carries those, but leaves and 
despises us? Yes, preach what you want, | see 


1) So in all editions. It seems to us that it should be read: "We call 
such a one daring, who freely woget'-), and almost agrees with the 
Hebrew Boged or Woged", so that the opinion is: it is a consonance in 
the words "vermégen" and "Boged". The Latin translator offers: 
Hujusinodi nos autiaeom, Hui nullo N6qu6 veuin ne‘ne bonnnuin 
rospeotu Huidvis attontaro audet, Hui non lonAO ab bebrasa voos 
(bo*sd) ant (VuoAsd) intorvallo distat, vooaN1U8. 


that is: dares.

W. VI, 3138-3140. 1451 





what the opinion is. It is like Moses at the Red Sea 
[Exodus 14], and at Paran with Korah [Exodus 16], 
where neither speech nor counsel helps. That is why 
Habakkuk writes this piece with important and many 
words, to strengthen and comfort the people. 

69 Third, that God gives the wicked such great 
fortune that he devours those who are more pious than 
he is, that is, the Jews in particular, along with many 
other countries and people who have also been more 
pious than the Babylonians. For so it is, where there is 
great wealth and power, there is also great sin and 
injustice. Money makes thieves, fortune makes husks. 
As has been said, great fortune is too heavy for a man 
to bear. Now it would be a little easier if the wicked did 
not eat the pious, but those who are worse or equally 
wicked. But now God allows them to devour the most 
pious. Sometimes it would be easier if the wicked alone 
would punish or do a little harm to the pious; but this is 
especially wretched, that the wicked devour and even 
devour the pious, leaving nothing, but destroying 
everything, as the 79th Psalm, v. 7, says: "Lord, they 
have devoured Jacob and made his cities desolate" 2c. 
And in addition to all this, they have the glory and honor, 
as if God were with them, and have done well, as 
Habakkuk says above [v. 11] with bitter words: "Then his 
victory must be of his God." 

70. All this is quite a cross for the children of God. 
Their suffering must be done in such a way that they 
must succumb and be wronged, and see that their 
enemies lead the victory over them, and still boast of 
God; as Christ also says John 16:2: "The hour is coming 
that whoever kills you will think that he is doing God a 
service. This is how Christ himself was on the cross. But 
there lies hidden the high and deep wisdom of God, 
there He is wondrous in His saints [Ps. 4, 4.], even in His 
enemies. All this goes beyond all reason and experience 
of human understanding. 


V.14. And let men go like fish in the sea, like worms 
that have no master. 


71 All this is still talked about in martial faith, by the 
godless Babylonian fortune. 





about other country and people. How do the fish in the 
sea go? They have no rule nor order to defend 
themselves against anyone, but float along; he who 
sows sows, he who eats has; there is no one to defend 
or defend, so that such fish are no different than those 
laid before the eyes of the eaters. Men saw them and 
eat them, great fish and vipers eat them, eagles, harriers 
and other birds eat them, beavers and other animals eat 
them, they are only food, both to 1) men, birds, animals 
and fish. In the same way you let all the lands and people 
be to the Chaldeans, that they only saw, eat and gobble. 
Is it not grievous then, that to such wicked, ungodly men, 
all godly lands and people should be like kitchen tables, 
which they saw, slaying and devouring as they will? Just 
as Paul [Rom. 8, 36.] also leads the saying from the 
Psalter [Ps. 44, 23.]: "We must die daily for thy sake, yet 
we are counted as sheep for the slaughter." 

The other, "like worms that have no master," is just 
the same. For he speaks not, in my opinion, of the 
worms of the land, but in the sea, as there are the small 
fishes, as Ps. 104:25: "There are worms without number 
in the sea." For Remes, in Hebrew, means everything 
that crawls and creeps, which | call worms, although the 
word is too narrow, but | have no other. We speak: It 
creeps and swarm. And Habakkuk adds this to indicate 
which fish he is talking about, namely the small ones, 
which are poor little worms compared to their eaters. For 
man has fishing rods, nets, twine, baskets, fish traps and 
all kinds of gear to sow and eat them, without what birds 
and large fish do with beaks and claws. All these have 
no master, that is, they have no order, nor do they know 
how to keep to anyone, but go astray, only to feed 
others. 


V. 15: He draws it all with his heels, he fetches it 
with his net, and gathers it with his yarn. 


73. he makes fishermen out of the chaldeans, like 
Moses, Genesis 10:9, out of the nim-. 


1) Instead of "the" in the original and in the editions we have put 
"den". Walch already had: "at the".

rod makes a hunter. And as | have said, man hath divers 
instruments to see the fishes: so here also he giveth 
unto the king of Babylon, that he is a mighty and skillful 
fisherman, who with divers painting draweth, seeth, and 
gathereth all things unto himself. These "fishes, nets and 
yarns" are nothing else than his great and mighty 
armies, so that he has won all the lands and people, and 
has drawn all the world's goods, jewels, silver and gold, 
interest and annuity to himself in Babylon, so that he 
also takes away the vessels in the temple at Jerusalem. 
For what is it but for a great king to send forth his army 
over a land, and to gain it, to take all the Baar's burden 
of money and treasure, and to carry away the people, 
and at the last to keep interest and rent in the same land, 
as a fisherman that casteth out his net, and draweth all 
that he soweth, and keepeth that is good? 


He rejoices and is glad. 


(74) How perverted it is to the prophet that the wicked 
Chaldeans have such good fortune, and that they are 
glad of it, when all the earth and people weep and are 
grieved. They are in good spirits and think they have 
done well. How they are tickled by such victory and 
happiness, and they feel so good, but they do not know 
that God is fattening them up for the slaughter. 

(75) Now all these things are written for our sakes, 
that such and such an example may be our consolation, 
when we also see that the wicked are so well off, and 
they glory and rejoice over us in our misery, and shall 
not think otherwise, it is fattened cattle. 12, 3.] For the 
cattle that are fattened are not put forth for pleasure or 
for custom, but into the kitchen for the meat-bank; but 
those that are put forth for pleasure and for custom are 
kept lean and slender. God is a great cook, has also a 
great kitchen, therefore he fattens great beasts, that is, 
mighty kings and princes, and fattens them well, that 
they may have more than all abundance of goods, 
honor, pleasure and power, makes them merry and 
dance, even over the necks and bodies of his children, 
as Herod's daughter danced over St. John. John danced 
[Matth. 14, 6.], and the world was joyful when Christ said 
[Joh. 16, 20.],since the apostles were grieved. So tickled 
the king of Babylon and 


He was especially successful in winning over the Jews, 
who were famous for being unconquerable because of 
God, 1) and dealt with them more cruelly than with 
others. 


V.16. For this reason he sacrifices to his net and 
burns incense to his yarn, because through them his 
portion has become so fat and his food so complete. 


76) Above [v. 11] he says: "Then his victory must be 
of his god", that is, he gives the honor to his idol Bel and 
Nebo (for so Isaiah Cap. 46, 1. calls the god of Babylon), 
and not to the right God of Jerusalem. Here he says, 
"that he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense to his 
yarn," when we have now said that his net and yarn are 
to be understood as his army power. How then does he 
sacrifice the same, and yet at the same time give glory 
to his God? Answer: The prophet is so inflamed about 
the Chaldeans that he mocks the king of Babylon and 
the Shemites, along with their god and worship, for the 
great zeal he has for God and his people. As if he should 
say: To whom do you burn incense and sacrifice? If 
there is no God, then the idol is nothing, as St. Paul says 
1 Cor. 10:19. | will tell you 2) to whom such sacrifice and 
incense is done, that is, to your own net, to your own 
power. For whoever boasts about a thing and is happy 
and joyful about it, as you are about such happiness, but 
does not give thanks to the right God, as you also do, 
makes himself an idol, gives him the glory himself, does 
not rejoice in God, but in his power and work. Therefore, 
even though you call God with your mouth, and sacrifice 
and burn incense before the idol with your hand, it is 
nothing in the bottom of your heart, but you think highly 
of yourselves, and please yourselves that you are able 
to do such things, and think that you are worthy and 
deserving. Therefore your net, that is, your power and 
authority, is your God, to whom you sacrifice and burn 
incense. For you rely on your power, defy it, boast of it, 
rejoice in it. If this were not the case, your idol would be 
of little help or pleasure to you.

1455 





77 Inthe same way, Isaiah Cap. 2, 8: "They worship 
the work of their hands and the work that their fingers 
have done"; and Apost. 7, 41. Stephen says: "They 
rejoiced in the works of their hands." For what a man 
rejoices in that he relies on is his God; for he should rely 
on no one but God alone, nor rejoice in any other thing 
but God. But the wicked must take comfort in their works 
and violence; that is their God, they cannot do otherwise. 

78. Now the prophet will say: How fine a God you 
have! Your net, your own power is your God, which you 
do not have, but from our God. He also rebukes 
blasphemers for not giving glory to God, and accuses 
them before God for such great ingratitude and perverse, 
blasphemous idolatry. As if to say: This is the fruit of your 
not punishing them, and making them so fortunate that 
they not only oppress men, but also touch you 
themselves, and give your honor to their net, the violence 
they have from you. This makes "his portion so fat, and 
his meat so full," that is, by such violence he has got so 
great a good and kingdom, and is well fattened. But to be 
well fattened makes idolatry, as Moses speaks in his 
song [Deut. 32:5]: "He is fat, and fat, and became 
complete; therefore he became rebellious." The two 
divine services, sacrifice and incense, are almost 
common in Scripture, and 





come from the Law of Moses; but whether the 
Babylonians also had the two, or whether the prophet 
intended to interpret those services by these names, | 
leave to each one his own discretion; there is nothing in 
it. 

V. 17 For this reason he still casts his net and will 


never stop strangling people. 


The more money becomes, the greater avarice 
becomes, that one can never satisfy it with good, but 
only continues. So also all other human evil airs. The 
greater honor one has, the more he wants to have, the 
more land and power, the more desire to increase the 
same. Thus the pagans write of the great Alexandro that 
he was not satiated with a whole world. For when he 
heard from a philosopher that there was much more 
than one world, he sighed and said, "And | have not yet 
gained one. So here Habakkuk chides the king of 
Babylon's insatiable avarice for not allowing him to be 
satisfied, but because his portion is so fat, he still casts 
his net to gain more land and people, and is called 
strangling people. Because to win land and people, 
there is no other way, one strangles people over it. But 
there the murderous avarice does not ask, that he is only 
rich and fat. And here you see for yourself that his 
violence is to be understood by the net, by which he 
strangles the people and draws their goods to himself. 


The second chapter. 


V. 1. Here | stand upon my guard, and tread upon 

the stronghold, and watch, and see what shall be said 
unto me, and what shall answer him that reproacheth 
me. 
(1) Here it comes to pass, and rightly so, that | have said 
above [Cap. 1, § 68] that the prophet does not stand 
alone for himself in the battle faith against the Babylonian 
fortune, but must also fence and fight against the 
unbelief of his people, to whom he preaches, and 


comfort and strengthen them. Therefore, before he 
prophesies against the Babylonians and proclaims their 
calamity, he must first break with his unbelieving people, 
so that he will keep them in the sermon and they will 
listen to him. Just as if a preacher were now preaching 
about a future or present evil, and the people were 
beginning to despair and run as if there were no hope 
left, he would have to be truly bold and praise his 
ministry, 


1456 Erl. 42, 50-52. interpretation of Habakkuk (1.), Cap. 2, 1. W. VI, 3146-3149. 


to admonish them to stand and listen fully to how it 
should go out and how God would punish such iniquity 
again and redeem them. 

2 Habakkuk must also do this for the sake of those 
who had to experience the future of the Babylonian 
tyranny of which he spoke, so that they did not despair, 
as if all hope was over. For the people had been 
promised by God that Christ would come and begin a 
glorious kingdom in Jerusalem; they were now 
persuaded of this and awaited it. Therefore they also 
thought that Jerusalem must remain before all the world, 
and that they also must remain in the land, so that they 
could not believe Habakkuk's prophecy about the future 
of the Babylonians. But when they came and learned the 
prophet's prophecy by deed, they believed it 1) too 
much, so also that they now also despaired of the future 
kingdom of Christ, because it did not come while 
Jerusalem stood and they dwelt in the land. Then these 
and similar words will have gone in the common clamor: 
Where are the prophets who promised us Christ? How 
finely they have deceived us! Yes, believe now whoever 
wants him to come. How should he come? Jerusalem 
lies in ashes, and we have been led away to foreign 
lands. Fie on you prophets, all in a heap! You are 
nothing but knaves who deceive the land and the 
people. 

So reason does when God fulfills his word in a 
different way than it had modeled for it. For it always 
wants to determine God's measure, time and way of 
keeping his vow, or no longer wants to believe. So God 
cannot do otherwise than to fulfill his word in a strange 
way, and much differently than we think. Thus it is that 
one does not want to believe God at any time. When he 
prophesies, the present happiness and the fact that we 
do not yet feel the future misfortune prevent us from 
believing his prophesy. If he promises grace, then the 
present misfortune hinders us, and that we do not yet 
feel the future grace. 


1) Jenaer and Erlanger: "des"; Wittenberger: "es". The latter is 
probably a conjecture for "des", which will be found in the original, 
brought in by a printing error. Dmn "believe" with the genitive does 
not occur. 


1457 


not feel that we believe his promise either. 

(4) The prophets first of all had to deal with the timid, 
unbelieving people. For how could God begin Christ's 
promised kingdom in a more foolish and strange way, 
than by letting Jerusalem, where it was supposed to be, 
be disturbed by godless despisers and his enemies, and 
by letting his own people be led away? How could they 
believe that Jerusalem would lie in ashes and at the 
same time become the most glorious kingdom? Reason 
had to sink here and despair, and who should remain, he 
had to hover and hang above all senses and reason, 
alone in God's word, so that he would see a new 
Jerusalem, which was still nowhere to be seen, and 
completely have an invisible Jerusalem for certain, as if 
it were there, since the visible one lay in the ashes before 
his eyes. Likewise, you will find a beautiful example of 
this very thing in Jer. 32, where the prophet marvels at 
how it is possible for God that Jerusalem should be 
desolate at the same time, and yet be raised up again so 
that people can buy and trade in it. Read the same 
chapter, for it serves here as the right gloss. 

5 For so Habakkuk also does here, that he proclaims 
the destruction, and yet again promises that all the 
prophecies of Christ shall be fulfilled, against and above 
all sense and reason. Therefore he now says, "Here | 
stand on my guard, and tread upon the fortress." He 
stands like a man of war who steps on a guard to defend 
himself. But to whom is such waiting and guarding? 
Against whom does he contend? Against the unbelief 
and impatience of the people. As if he were to say, "You 
grumble and are impatient, and make many others also 
unbelieving, so that they do not believe me or all the 
prophets, but despair of the promised Christ; so | will not 
cease, but will prepare myself and stand against you, 
and now preach all the more, if some will still keep the 
faith. Therefore | stand as one who stands on the 
fortress, guard and guard, and fights; so | also guard and 
fight strongly and steadfastly for the

vsluti.

3149-3151. 1459 





Weak in faith, against you unbelievers and 
despondents, and so stand that you shall not overthrow 
me. For | stand "on the stronghold," that is, | have God's 
word for me, on which | rely and believe; therefore | also 
speak and preach to others. This, as | have said, is of 
great need when the people tremble, so that the prophet 
may stand firm on his word, may stand firm, may not 
waver or falter, either because of misfortune or because 
of unbelief, grumbling and blasphemy among the 
people. For if he who is to guide and keep the word and 
comfort waver and falter, the banner is lost, and the 
watchman is dead; but if he stands, some cling to him 
and look to him. 

6 "I look," he says, "what is said to me, and what | 
should answer him who reproaches me," that is, | wait 
for the reproaches of the unbelievers and blasphemers, 
how | should answer the same, who deceive and deter 
the weak, and reproach me and all the prophets, as if 
we were liars, because God's word and work go 
differently than they thought. For if | did not answer them 
and preach against them, but remained silent and 
suffered their rebuke, they would turn the people away 
from God's word completely, so that no one would wait 
for Christ's future kingdom, but all would despair of it. 
Therefore | will wait stiffly for my office, and guard whom 
| can guard. 

(7) And here you see that the prophets had every 
intention of keeping the people in faith in the Christ who 
was to come, and so they attached themselves to Christ 
by saying that they believed in him, just as we now 
attach ourselves to him and believe. For this reason the 
prophet does not want to suffer reproach and 
blasphemy, even though we should gladly suffer 
reproach and blasphemy for God's sake. For where it 
concerns us, we should suffer it; but where it concerns 
doctrine, we should answer for it and excuse it, as Christ 
did in Joh. 8, 18 and (Cap. 18, 19. ff.) before the high 
priest 1) Annas. For he who leaves doctrine and the 
word in blasphemy, if he can defend it, helps the weak 
to be overthrown into unbelief. 


1) Wittenberger And Erlanger: Priests. 





Therefore it must always be on guard, taught, 
admonished, punished, preached and driven, for the 
sake of the elect, but who do not believe that they are let 
go after two or three admonitions, as St. Paul teaches 
Titus 3:10. 

8 The part: "what will be said to me", may perhaps be 
understood thus: | will see what God will say to me, 
because in Hebrew it reads, what will be said in me, so 
that this part would be understood by God's word, and 
the other afterwards by the blasphemers' word. But 
methinks both are to be understood of the blasphemers 
who speak and reproach in Habakkuk, that is, speak 
against him and 2) his word, and punish it with lies, as 
also Zach. 3, 2: "The Lord reproach thee, Satan"; that is, 
the Lord wanted to persuade thee, to take hold of thee, 
and to resist thee. Because Habakkuk stands on his 
guard and stronghold, he already has God's word on 
which he stands. And because he looks around and 
sees what is said to him, it is important to note that such 
looking and seeing is directed at people who speak 
against him, and therefore he stands and looks, so that 
he may comfort the weak and uphold them against those 
who speak against him. And so the word of God follows, 
which he is to hold up to the weak and to parents, saying: 


But the Lord answered and said unto me, Write the 
vision, and set it forth upon a tablet, that whosoever 
passeth by may read it. 


(9) He introduces the name of the Lord to frighten his 
wicked and to strengthen the weak, because it is not he 
himself who says and commands this, but God. Here it 
is to be noted that because things are always so high 
and strange in divine matters, that a man must leave all 
senses and reason behind, and cling to the mere word 
of God alone; otherwise it is all foolishness and 
foolishness what God does, 1 Cor. 2:11, 4, so God also 
uses an outward gesture or sign in addition to the word, 
just as one puts a seal on a letter to strengthen faith. So 
Jeremiah had to give a wooden seal. 


2) Wittenberger and Erlanger: "and in". 


1460 Erl. 4S, 55-57. interpretation of Habakkuk (1.), Cap. 2, 2-4. 


W. VI, 3151-3184. 4461 





The king of Babylon had to wear a chain on his neck next 
to the word when he proclaimed the imprisonment of all 
countries, which the king of Babylon would do, Jer. 28, 
10, and Isaiah [Cap. 20, 2.) had to go naked when he 
proclaimed how Egypt land should be despoiled; item, 
Jeremiah, Cap. 32:8, had to buy a field from his friend, 
next to the word, when he proclaimed that Jerusalem 
was to be rebuilt. And so on in many more places, that 
also in the New Testament, besides the Gospel, baptism 
and sacrament are used as outward signs. 

(10) Habakkuk also does this by divine command. 
Besides the word where he proclaims the future of the 
promised Christ and his kingdom, and that Jerusalem 
should be built again, he adds the outward sign or gift 
that he takes a tablet and writes on it with clear, coarse 
letters the same words as the prophecies of Christ are 
to be sure and come, unhindered by the king of Babylon, 
even if he turns Jerusalem into ashes and leads the 
people away from the land. This tablet was hung in a 
public place, as in the temple or in the marketplace, so 
that everyone could see and read it, and thus shut the 
mouths of those who failed and kept the weak in the faith 
as much as was possible. 

11 This is what he says: "Write the face and write it 
out on a tablet. What face? Not that Habakkuk saw, but 
of all the prophets who prophesied of Christ. For in 
Hebrew the prophecies are called visions, and the 
prophets are called seers or showers, as the text clearly 
indicates in 1 Sam. 9, 9. 1). So Gabriel also speaks, Dan. 
9, 23, that the vision and prophecy will be fulfilled. As if 
to say, "All the prophets' visions and prophecies go to 
Christ; therefore, when he comes, the vision will be 
fulfilled. From this it is clear that among the common 
people all prophecies about Christ were called visions 
by a common name. So much is said that Habakkuk 
says here, "Take a tablet and write on it the vision," that 
is, write on it a scripture of 


1) Wrong in all editions: 1 Reg. 5. 





of the prophecy concerning Christ, what is to be thought 
of the same, because the Jews are so hesitant and think 
that it is completely over. For Habakkuk did not write the 
vision, that is, all the prophecies of all the prophets who 
spoke about Christ, may be written on it; otherwise it 
would have had to be a large tablet, especially because 
he should write it so roughly that [it] could be read by 
someone in the course, but that he "writes the vision", 
that something is written, what is to be held of it, namely 
the words that will follow. And that he should strike it out 
or lay it out is nothing else, but that he should write it 
clearly, plainly and coarsely, and so coarsely and plainly 
that one does not have to stand before it and look, and 
count the letters and read them together, as is done in 
small or briefly recessed writing, but that [they] are quite 
large letters, that one can certainly see and read it, as in 
a glance, and grasp everything immediately in the run; 
yet not very run, but that he may nevertheless know the 
letters in the run. For one would run so much that he 
could not read them if they were letters like the pillars in 
the church. 

(12) The prophet's purpose is that it may be seen and 
read with certainty. This is what he means by the word 
"and strike it out," that is, make it clear, coarse, distinct, 
and knowable enough. This is to indicate that just as this 
tablet is read and seen clearly, plainly and distinctly, as 
it is known even to one who passes by, so it should also 
be certain that Christ will come, as the visions and words 
of the prophets speak of him, so that they will not be too 
frightened by the destruction of Jerusalem and their 
imprisonment, which they suffer from the king of 
Babylon. 


V.3. 4. Namely: The vision will come in its time, and 
will finally act freely, and will not remain outside. But 
if it delays, wait; it will surely come, and will not last 
long. But whoever strives against it, his soul will not 
succeed. For the righteous lives by faith. 


2) Wittenberg and Erlangen "also" instead of: but. But our reading 
(even in the Erlangen edition) is confirmed by the translation 
preceding the interpretation. 


1462 Erl. 42, 57-59. 


Interpretations on the prophets. W. VI. 3154-3157. 


1463 





(13) This is the text that was written roughly and 
clearly on the tablet. For this is what he was to write of 
the vision. And we see that [it] is fine words of comfort 
and promises for the weak, of the future fulfillment of all 
prophecies in Christ. So now the faith in Christ, who was 
to come, is kept, and it is guarded that one does not 
punish God in his prophets, as if his promise were false. 
For although Jerusalem was destroyed and the people 
were led away, the Jewish kingdom remained written in 
the Word of God, and there were prophets who endured 
and admonished the people to suffer such punishment 
for a certain time. This has not happened to the Jews 
now, in the last destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, 
when they were also driven away; but there is no prophet 
to comfort them and keep them from suffering such 
punishment until a certain time. Neither is their kingdom 
set in the word, but all things are forsaken, both of 
prophecies and royal persons; which was not done in the 
Babylonian disturbance. 

14 Therefore he says: The prophecies or visions of 
the future Christ and his kingdom are not over, although 
we are now disturbed for a time, but stand and still hold 
fast, as the prophets have spoken of it. But it has its 
appointed time, which no one knows, and is commanded 
by God. And when she now comes in her time, "she will 
act freely" and not lack or lie. For in the Hebrew it reads 
thus: "She will act freely and not lie," which | have 
translated: "She will not remain outside." Because that's 
what he wants, since he says they shall not lie or be 
lacking. And the "act freely" he does not mean 
differently, for as the 12th Psalm, v. 6, also uses the 
same word, saying, "I will establish a salvation, which 
shall act freely within." All of which is said: The 
prophecies of Christ, when they are now fulfilled, will go 
forth freely and break forth, which now lies hidden, so 
that they will be preached and spoken of in all the world, 
so that no one can hinder them, even if the gates of hell 
oppose them. For this is the nature of this Hebrew word 
"to act freely," that it means to freely, manifestly break 
out of the gates of hell. 





They lead with speeches, and confidently and boldly 
speak of one thing, not regarded by anyone, as Lucas 
writes of Paul, Apollo and others, that they acted joyfully, 
and spoke freely of Christ. 28, 31. 18, 26.]. 

(15) Then Habakkuk exhorted the weak who had 
difficulty believing this promise. Yes, they would say, | 
hear it well, it shall come in its time; but when will the 
time come? It is getting long, we are always being 
teased, and told, as Isaiah Cap. 28:13, "Wait and see, 
wait and see; here a little, and then a little; here one is 
called, there one is called, but once"; when will it be? | 
can see that if we hear and wait a lot, we will perish at 
last and become distraught. To such and such words, of 
which all prophets must hear much from the unbelievers 
or weak believers, Habakkuk now answers and says: 
"Well, if it delays a little, then wait, it will certainly come, 
and will not delay or take long. 

. (16) Further, over such a promise and exhortation he 
also gives counsel, that he may seek all ways to 
establish and maintain them in the faith. For no more 
ways can be found to strengthen the faith than the three 
things written on this tablet, which are promise, 
exhortation, and exhortation. If these do not help, 
nothing can help. But the forewarning is the last, 
according to good order, and the promise the first. For 
when one promises good things, and beseeches and 
exhorts, one must let go those who do not want to stay, 
and give the exhortation last; as one says to the 
disobedient: Go thy way, thou shalt prosper. And this is 
a right, godly, natural way of teaching. For these three 
things Christ and the apostles also hold, as did Moses 
and all the prophets. 

17) The words of persecution are these: "But whoever 
strives against it, his soul will not succeed. The Hebrew 
word Uphla, which in Latin they call contentio et 
pertinacia, we call reluctance, as the stubborn go 
against God's word, and do not let them be told badly, 
which St. Paul calls Rom. 2, 8, "quarrelsome", as he 
says: "Those who are quarrelsome and disobey the word 
of God". 


1464 Erl. 42, 59-62. interpretation of Habakkuk (1.), Cap. 2, 3. 4. W. VI, 3IS7-315S. 


1465 





not to the truth, but obey unrighteousness" 2c. With 
which words he shows us the very ones that Habakkuk 
means here with the word Uphla. They always find 
something that they speak against God's word, so that 
they do not have to believe. A peevish people that 
neither asks for promises, nor admonitions, nor 
prophecies. 

(18) Now whatever they gain by it, Habakkuk is not 
silent, saying, "Nothing will succeed for his soul." So 
also Isaiah [Cap. 7, 9.] drieth unto them, "If ye believe 
not, ye cannot abide." And Moses speaks in many 
places that they shall have no happiness where they 
would not be obedient to God. As then also happened, 
and always happens. And Christ Himself says [Marc. 16, 
16.], "He that believeth not is damned." For how can it 
be well with him who contends against God, and does 
not consider God faithful and true? He condemns God, 
so God condemns him again. And even if he is well for 
a short time, it is only his great pity and worse 
condemnation. 

(19) Finally, Habakkuk inscribed this scripture on the 
tablet with a master saying: "For the righteous lives by 
faith. That is, if someone is to be righteous and live, he 
must believe God's promise, then nothing else will come 
of it; again, the wicked dies of his unbelief. So also here, 
if you want to remain and be preserved, you must 
believe this scripture on the tablet, that Christ will come 
with his kingdom, and not be deceived that outwardly 
the thing looks much different to you, because you will 
be disturbed. For this is the nature of the divine word, 
that it holds things up higher and more senselessly than 
all sense and reason comprehend, and all experience 
feel. You see and feel the disturbance of your kingdom, 
therefore you must pass over your feelings by faith, and 
be sure, even in the midst of the disturbance, that your 
kingdom will come and be gloriously established. 

(20) Here we see how the prophets have preached 
and urged faith in Christ, as we do in the New 
Testament, and that Habakkuk is so bold as to condemn 
all other works and ascribe life to faith alone. For he 
saith aridly, Let the unbeliever not prosper. Let him now 
pray and be put to death. 


If a believer does not work or labor, his works are 
already condemned to be worthless and false, and shall 
not help him, and the believer shall live without the works 
of his faith. 

21 St. Paul uses this saying Rom. 1, 17, and quite 
well. For it is a common saying of all God's words that 
one must believe them to be spoken at the beginning, 
middle or end of the world; as the epistle to the Hebrews 
Cap. 11, 4. ff. counts many examples of faith from the 
beginning of the world, and yet also applies this saying 
to all of them at the same time. Habakkuk instructs him 
to believe the writing on the tablet: Paul [Gal. 2, 16.] 
instructs him to believe the gospel. Genesis 15:6, in 
other words, says the same thing, when it says: 
"Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for 
righteousness." What else can be said, because 
Abraham lived by his faith as a righteous man? 

(22) | say this for the sake of the Jewish objection, 
which some are industrious, want to be wise, and judge 
Paul as if he had introduced Habakkuk unjustly and by 
the hair by force, because Habakkuk speaks of his tablet 
and not of the gospel, although this tablet also speaks 
of the gospel, but of the future, but Paul does not speak 
of the tablet, but of the present gospel. But there is still 
one gospel, which was future and is now to come, just 
as there is one Christ, yesterday, today and forever, 
Hebr. 13:8, without him being proclaimed in a different 
way before and after his future. But there is nothing in 
this; it is nevertheless one faith and one spirit that 
believeth on him. 

23 But this is even cleverer thing, because they drool. 
St. Paul has not interpreted Habakkuk correctly. For 
they pretend that Habakkuk does not speak of faith but 
of truth, because he says: The righteous lives by his 
emunah. But emuna means truth. Now truth and faith 
are not one thing. Here | answer: It is true, in Hebrew the 
two words Emeth and Emuna are very similar, both 
come also from one trunk, which is called Amen. 
Therefore, because Emeth means truth, Emuna should 
also be called truth, as the Greek and Latin Bible 
interprets it from the Hebrew. But it is not 


1466 


Erl. 42, 62-64. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 31S9-3163. 


1467 





right, Paul has interpreted it differently and right, Emuna 
faith. For let it be said that emunah in Hebrew also 
means truth (which they will not prove), so the common 
usage of the Scriptures compels everywhere that 
emunah means truth, as a pious man is true and faithful, 
and keeps what he speaks. But emunah is the name of 
the truth that a man has in his heart, and is connected 
with the other man's truth and truth. Therefore emunim 
are called those who trust and believe, or rely and cling 
to another's truth, Ps. 31:24: "The Lord keepeth the 
emunim," that is, those who trust and believe him. Now 
| let it happen. 


Whoever wants to be so quarrelsome that he attaches 
the mind in his heart to another than the faithful and true, 
and relies on him, call it truth or whatever he wants; Paul 
and we do not know how to call such courage anything 
else but faith, and those who have such courage are 
believers. For by this they also become truthful, that is, 
righteous, faithful, devout people. So God is called in the 
Scriptures: Deus Emeth, as Ps. 31, 6. 1) about Deus 
Emuna, as 5 Mos. 32, 4. For it is both His, both His truth 
and our faith. But enough of that. 


1) In all editions: Ps. 30. 


The third chapter. 


Cap. 2, 5. But the one who entrusts a proud man, so 
that he cannot stay, who opens his soul like hell, and 
is just like death, which cannot be satisfied, but draws 
to himself all the nations, and gathers to himself all the 
peoples. 


In the first chapter, the prophet mourned over the 
people of Israel, proclaiming the destruction and 
lamenting over the destroyer, the king of Babylon. In the 
second chapter he comforted them again by word and 
outward signs, with the future of Christ and his kingdom. 
In this third chapter, he now condemns the king of 
Babylon and his kingdom with many words and sayings, 
and all this so that the Jews will not despair, as if their 
prison would remain forever, but will be comforted, so 
that their enemy will be destroyed again, and they will be 
redeemed and become much more glorious. As he will 
also comfort them in the fourth chapter with the previous 
miracles of God. 

(2) For, as has been said, it is the chief desire of him 
and of all the other prophets to comfort the people and 
keep them in faith and hope in the Christ who is to come, 
so that they will not despair of him because things are 
going so badly for them, and so that they will not lose 
hope in him. 


It seems as if it is lost and nothing will come of it, just as 
the apostles also comfort us Christians that under the 
cross we nevertheless hope in firm faith of an eternal life 
and kingdom in heaven. 

3. above [v. 15] he compares the king of Babylon to 
a fisherman who snatches up everything and eats and 
devours it. Here he compares him to a drunkard who 
drinks so much that he spits. And thus he wants to say: 
Just as the wine at first comes down so smooth and 
sweet, especially when the drunkard is defiant and 
wants to be praised for his drinking as a beer hero or 
wine knight, so the wine can be drunk confidently, and 
the drunkard wants to chase the prize with drinking. But 
at last the drunken wine becomes master in the head, 
and throws the boozer under the bench, that he 
becomes a sow cook, fpeiet and unflatet therefore, that 
house and yard stink. There the proud man and fine hero 
lies as a dumb, unreasonable animal, like a sow, so that 
there is nothing more human about him than his outward 
appearance. And that is shameful to see and to hear, so 
much more, so much more honest the man should be. 
So wine has deceived him, that is, as it says in Hebrew, 
it has disgraced him so that he is despised and no one 
thinks anything of him, so that even a child is disgraced. 


1468 Er1. 42, 64-66. interpretation of Habakkuk (1.), Cap. 2, 5. W. VI, 3163-3166. 


1469 





not afraid of him, yes, not even the swine, which 
nevertheless eat his gurgle soups around him. For what 
should a full man do? He can neither speak nor create, 
as he is deprived of all reason, senses, language, wit and 
strength; there he lies as a block. If he were the cruel 
Hector or Achilles before, then he is also the mockery 
and song of the children, who point at him with their 
fingers, laugh and mimic him with mocking words as they 
wish. So also the Latin sages wrote that a drunken man 
is neither alive nor dead. 

4 The king of Babylon is a great and proud drunkard, not 
one who drinks wine, but, as Habakkuk says, "he opens 
his mouth as wide as hell, and cannot be satisfied, like 
death,” and he takes, drinks, and devours all the land and 
all the people. Well then, the wine is sweet to the taste; 
for it is pleasant to see so great a land and people thrown 
under one another, and to become so powerful, that is, 
to become so full and drunk. But in the end it is shameful 
when he has to spit them all out again and give them 
away, so that he is destroyed and retains no kingdom, 
land, people or city, as happened to the king of Babylon 
when he was destroyed by the Persians. Then it 
happened, as Habakkuk writes here, that he had to spit 
again with all the shame everything he had drunk. For he 
had to lose all land and people, and he also had to be 
destroyed. This is what it means, "the wine depresses or 
disgraces the proud man, so that he cannot remain. For 
the word "afflicted" is just that of which we said above, 
Cap. 1, 14, boged or woged, when one is so utterly 
destroyed or despised that one is immediately certain 
that he is and counts for nothing. Item, where he says, 
"that he cannot remain," means that he keeps no house, 
nor dwelling, as he is driven out of his kingdom. 

(5) We Germans have a proverb that is almost equal 
to this saying of Habakkuk, because we say: A drunken 
house spits out the host. If, as Habakkuk does, we were 
to draw such a line and point to a tyrant who flays and 
scrapes the people as some bishops and princes do now, 
we would also say: "Awe, he drinks too much, and gets 
too full, the drunken house will 





The king will spit out the host, that is, he will rob and 
squeeze so hard that he will be despised, and in the end 
he will have to perish; yes, he will not only be despised, 
but also hostile, to whom no one will be friendly and 
everyone will be hostile. But such an empire, which is 
maintained by fear and violence through hostile tyrants, 
and not also with love and favor of the subjects, it cannot 
exist, as all history testifies, and all experiences prove 
daily. 

(6) And Habakkuk's saying is true, that wine despises 
and disgraces proud tyrants, when they drink too much 
and are so full of the goods of the land and the people. 
For his neighbors do not like his power, because they 
fear that it will become too great over them. Therefore 
they put their heads together and sit down against him. 
Then his power is over. Because he has his own people, 
land and people against him, that they are hostile to him, 
they want other lords; then his enemies rely on that. So 
he is worthless inside and out, and must spit out what he 
has drunk. Likewise it happened to the king of Babylon, 
that both the Medes and the Persians set themselves 
against him as his neighbors, and disturbed him, which 
gladly saw much of his land and people. 

(7) Now watch how the prophet scolds the king's tyranny 
with sharp, bitter words. First he calls him "a proud man. 
For so are tyrants, so proud by force that the common 
man must become an enemy to them, because they not 
only oppress and oppress, but also act proudly and 
arrogantly with the people, and do it with all their might. 
(8) Secondly, he compares it to "the mouth of hell," which 
is so wide that it swallows up the whole world, and yet it 
does not close. So too, death, though it strangles all the 
world, is not satisfied. These words speak powerfully of 
the insatiable avarice of tyrants. The prophet also shows 
how 1) a human heart is minded when it desires good 
and honor, namely, that the more it has, the more it wants 
to have; if it had the whole world, it would gladly have 
two; if it had two, it would gladly have two. 


1) Wittenberg and Erlanger: what. 


1470 Erl. 4s, 66-68. interpretations on the prophets. W. vi, 


3166-3169. 1471 





have ten. Summa, if death and hell become full, a stingy 
heart will also have enough, and not before. 

(9) Therefore it is not to be done how to satisfy 
avarice, death, hell, and give so much that they say: 
Enough; but avarice must be put to death, as well as 
death and hell. But as no one but Christ kills death and 
hell, so no one but Christ can kill avarice, like all other 
sins, unless bodily death takes away the avaricious man, 
so that he can never practice avarice, as it is said, "You 
will be full one day when they hit you with shovels. But 
the miser goes with him nevertheless, and remains with 
him, like other sin. Otherwise the miser can do no good 
on earth (as the pagans say) without dying. 


V. 6. But what is the matter? All these will make a 
saying of him, and a legend and a proverb, and will 
Say. 

(10) The prophet continues in the similitude of a full, 
drunken man, how he becomes disgraced, and (as said 
[§ 3]) that one points fingers at him, laughs and mocks 
him, when before he was so strong that everyone feared 
him, but now he is so full that he lies there like a sow; or, 
when he walks, he staggers and staggers so foolishly 
that one has to laugh at him. He wants to do a lot and 
can't stand on his legs. The tyrant's splendor is the same 
in the end, that they not only lose power and property, 
and, like the drunkards, can neither stand nor stay 
anywhere, but that they are also mocked and laughed at 
with pointed and colorful, mocking words: Where are you 
now, Squire? Where is your anger? In short, they show 
him the figs, and as highly as he was feared, so deeply 
is he now despised, as we fehen in the course of the 
world. As it is now with the pope and his servants, 
everyone sings, writes, laughs, mocks, and scorns, who 
before was not allowed to gape or murmur. Just such 
mockery and laughter Habakkuk announces here also 
about the king of Babylon in all countries (since he is 
cruel now) in the future. But who would have told it to 
him, he would have thought: It is impossible, and are 
foolheidings. 





Yet it is proclaimed to the Jews for comfort, even though 
few believed it. 

(11) God also makes it especially strange. He says 
that the tyrants will be laughed at, and yet they are so 
firmly established and deeply rooted, as Jeremiah says 
[Cap. 12, 2]; just as Ps. 2, 4 also says [Jer. 12, 13] that 
God laughs at and mocks the nations, princes and kings 
who oppose His Christ. Does this mean that they 
laughed and mocked, when they were so powerful that 
they crucified Christ and persecuted and killed all his 
disciples, but they still remained in the land and in their 
power? Yes, therefore faith belongs to it. These are 
sermons of faith, which do not declare what they say, but 
promise in the future, contrary to that which is before the 
eyes and stands. Christ's gospel has never been 
stronger in any place than when it was least wanted. For 
when the hour came, the tyrants perished, and the word 
remained on the scene. And now also, when the princes 
and bishops most vehemently resist the gospel, there it 
must come and go the most. So they will mock and say: 
Where are they now, who did not want to suffer this? In 
the grave they lie, the worms devour them, the word of 
God nevertheless stands and goes in their dominion. So 
Annas and Caiphas had to let Christ remain in 
Jerusalem with the word, and have the mockery of it. But 
where Christ's word is and remains, there it is said: 
Christ's victory and kingdom remain; he keeps the field 
with his teaching, and other teachings must remain 
silent, like mice, as we see in experience. 


Woe to him who increases his wealth with the 
wealth of others. How long shall it last? And only loads 
a lot of mud on himself. 


(12) Here he counts in order some of the mocking 
words that would go against the Babylonian tyrant in the 
land. There are four of them; Habakkuk adds the fifth for 
himself. And that he makes such a mockery, and has his 
mockery of the mighty king, we must always understand, 
where his heart stands, namely, to comfort the Jews, so 
that they do not despair of the future of Christ. For, as 
has been said, this is the prophet's foremost cause and 
opinion, 


1472- kx. 42, 68-71. interpretation of Habakkuk (1.), Cap. 2, 6-8. 


W. VI, 3169-3172. 1473 





That he would comfort the weak and endure in the 
disturbance Jerusalem 2c. 

The first mocking song that will be said and sung about 
this impotent, drunken tyrant in all countries is about his 
avarice, so that he has scorned great goods from all 
countries. For this is the louse and order of the world, 
that it first seeks money and goods; after that one builds, 
after that one seeks pleasure and joy, at last power and 
honor. We will also see these four pieces here one after 
the other in the mockery of the drunken tyrant. He has 
made his possessions great, not by God's blessing and 
gift, as the kings of Israel and Judah did in their own land, 
but he has taken them by force from others, that is, he 
has conquered all the lands and put interest and all kinds 
of valuations on them, until he has seized all that was in 
the land. And this not by God's command, but out of 
avarice and arrogance (though by God's decree), as the 
tyrants use to do, and all kingdoms do, which arise by 
strife and violence, without God's command. Therefore 
such kingdoms are also called "mountains of robbery", 
Ps. 76, 5. 

Fourteenth, "How long shall it last?" That is, he does 
not act differently, as if it should last forever. Such 
mockery should not have been sung when the king sat 
in the kingdom, he would not have suffered it. For tyrants 
want to be right, and what they gain in this way should 
not be a foreign good. But now he is gone, they sing it 
freely, and mock his avarice with all certainty, to his great 
shame, that he has perished cheaply, as a public land 
robber, and so long possessed foreign property, which 
he must now return with shame. And he calls such 
property much and thick mud, not only because of the 
property, but because he thereby incurs the hatred, envy 
and enmity of all people and countries, under which he 
must be suffocated and crushed, and cannot turn it away 
or throw it away. For in the mud no one can stand either 
behind or in front of him, and must stand. So, whoever 
loses the common prayer and favor, he is badly lost 
without all comfort. ; : 

V. 7. 0 how suddenly those who bite you will wake 
up, and those who push you away will awaken, and 
you must be given to them. 





(15) Habakkuk 1) speaks these things for the future, and 
yet they shall be words of mockery to them that shall see 
Babylon disturbed, saying, Behold, how soon are they 
come that have bitten thee. But because it had not 
happened yet, he comforts the Jews with it, and gives 
comfort to the king. He describes how it happens when a 
tyrant is safely asleep and suddenly comes into trouble, 
and takes a likeness of a sleeping or snoring man, who 
lies safely there in sleep and does not move; but comes 
that bites him hard or stings him, as a horn or worm, he 
wakes up from sleep, is frightened and starts up, as if the 
country were full of enemies. 

(16) The same thing happened to the king of Babylon. 
When he was safe, sitting and drinking, and had good 
courage, as Daniel writes, the Persians and Medes came 
suddenly, won Babylon, and killed the king in one night, 
Daniel 5:30. Then the king rose up and became brave, 
and, as the text says here, he was pushed away, chased 
out of the secure camp, and yet could not escape, but 
had to give himself to them, so that the Persians and 
Medes divided up his property, land and people. It is a 
great pity that a man would like to escape, but he cannot 
escape and must be given to his enemies. This is how he 
pays for what he has done to others, as follows. 


V. 8 For thou hast robbed many nations; so shall all 
the remnant of the people rob thee again, for the blood 
of men, and for the iniquity of the land, and of the city, 
and of all that dwell therein. 


(17) He accuses the tyrant of robbing other nations and 
oppressing them by force as the least of it, but for the 
comfort of the Jews he especially accuses him of 
destroying the land of Judah and the city of Jerusalem 
with its people in order to increase his wealth. For when 
he says, "for the blood of men," he means all the other 
Gentiles, who were not Jews but were like other men, 
over whom he shed much blood without cause, only that 
he might become rich and a great lord. That he might call 
him an abominable murderer, because of his shameful 
avarice.

for the sake of it. How still today worldly bishops and 
princes pay no attention to how much human blood it 
costs that they only become rich and great lords, how the 
course of the world and the devil's rule goes. 

018 But the iniquity of the land of Judah, and of the 
city of Jerusalem, he reckoned greater, because God 
dwelt there, who had his worship, his people, his temple, 
and his word. Because of this, the king there sinned the 
most iniquitously, that is, with violence and injustice, 
against divine and holy things. Therefore he does not call 
the land, the city and the people by their own names, but 
speaks of them by common names, as if there were no 
more land, city or people that the king had corrupted. For 
what he has done to other godless lands and cities and 
people is small compared to this land. 

19 The histories also write that all sacrilege 
committed against sacred things is commonly quick and 
soon smelled. Hence the saying: It is not good to joke 
with saints, they like to draw. Item: You do not believe 
the saints, they draw. So it is said of Cn. 1) Pompejo, the 
most blessed prince of Rome, that he never had any 
more luck, since he had defiled the temple at Jerusalem. 
And it had also been Babylon, which [it] should become, 
2) since the king had disturbed Jerusalem; soon after 
that it decreased, that he himself became an 
unreasonable animal, and no one more so powerful, and 
his kingdom after his son even fell away, in the third 
member, as Daniel writes at the 5th chapter. 

(20) For God is so firm about His name that He does 
not allow it to be blasphemed in the idols, since all idols 
bear God's name and are called God. Those who have 
mocked the idols or blasphemed them are often 
punished, as the pagan books testify. Hence also such 
fear came among the people that they also feared the 
idols; not that therefore idolatry was right or 
unpunishable, but that a heart that is so rough and 
impudent to mock the idol, also mocks the right and 
wrong idol so much.

God, because God's name is there. For they do not do it 
out of faith, as the Christians do, but out of sacrilege and 
presumption. So God lets the devil punish and torment 
them. Just as in our times St. Anthony, St. Ballen, and 
the like have often plagued the sacrilegious, that is, the 
devil has done it out of God's decree, so that such 
blasphemers and sacrilegious people would do the 
same to the right saints and to God Himself, as they do 
to the saints whom they consider holy. So | said that this 
proverb comes from this: The saints like to draw. For 
what one considers holy, even if it is not holy in itself, it 
is still holy to him who considers it so. For he takes God's 
name, which alone is holy, and misuses it, and 
blasphemes it, and does it wrong. Enough of that. 


V. 9 Woe to him who is stingy to the misfortune of 
his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he 
may escape disaster. 


21 The other mocking song that will be sung is about 
his solid building. For that is how it is: When one has 
gained great money and property, land and people, one 
thinks how it will be preserved and kept. Here avarice 
has first of all to do, yes, as much or more, than how he 
gains it; 3) then he drives that one builds firm, strong 
chambers, castle and cities, so that one is safe from the 
enemies. For since they did not receive the property 
from God by faith, but brought it to themselves with 
avarice, they cannot trust or command God, but seek 
themselves with great wit, counsel and art how to 
preserve and defend it. Thus miracle after miracle is 
written of kings, how they built strong cities, as Judith 
1:2-4 Arbaces king of Media built Egbathanis, that the 
walls were thirty cubits thick, and seventy cubits high, 
and the towers a hundred cubits high. People listened to 
this, and | believe that work was done. 

22. still one says of this Babylon much greater thing, 
what an excellent, unbelievable thing it was, that 
Aristotle says it was 


3) In the editions: gewinnet. In Latin: luerstur.

would not be a city, but a whole country, enclosed in the 
ring walls. For the circular wall had around it sixty 
thousand paces, as Pliny writes, which makes fifteen 
German miles. Fifteen miles within the ring wall would 
make a city five miles long and wide. Thus the walls were 
fifty shoes thick, and two hundred shoes high, to reckon 
a shoe almost as long as an elbow, that is, three great 
fingers long, and there were six hundred council houses 
in it, and many other things. Therefore Babylon was 
counted as one of the seven wonders that were in the 
world. Of course, it is a miracle that people were able to 
build such a structure. 

23) Now the king and the Babylonians defied such a 
city, and were proud, as certain that it should be 
impossible to win it, or to disturb the kingdom. Just as 
Isaiah 1) Cap. 47, 8. tells how Babylon boasts and says: 
"lam alone, and there is none else, | will never become 
a widow, or be without children" 2c. And it is no wonder 
that a human heart relies on such mighty power and 
good, if it relies on lesser good and defies it. But it was 
hard for the Jews to believe that they should come again 
from Babylon, after they had been so captivated by great 
power, corrupted and disturbed. That is why the 
prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah and here Habakkuk cry out 
with all their might against this city, so that they may 
keep the people with comfort in the faith in the future 
Christ. For who could believe it now, if such a sermon 
were preached, that such a mighty kingdom should be 
so easily destroyed, and the captives loosed? It is so 
high and far above all reason and sense. 

24) But if God did not perform miracles otherwise, He 
would have proven enough here in this city and in the 
kingdom how no power nor force helps when He turns 
away His hand, and no building nor fortress exists. 2)

Where he ceases to protect, as the 127th Psalm, v. 1, 
says: "Where the Lord does not keep the city, the keeper 
keeps in vain. In this way he has shown how he is to be 
feared, even by all the great lords of the earth, and that 
they should not be proud of their possessions and 
power. For if Babylon has not remained, where will the 
Turk, where will our emperor, kings and princes remain, 
who hardly want to be citizens of Babylon? 

25 Again, all those who are persecuted, imprisoned 
and tormented by tyrants are comforted. For if he was 
able to deliver the Jews from Babylon, where there were 
such proud, mighty and wicked tyrants, how should he 
not also deliver them from many lesser ones? This is 
why Habakkuk comforts the Jews with a future 
redemption, mocking the tyrant of Babylon, and sings: 
"Just as the great good of Babylon, made up of all the 
nations, has been destroyed, cut in two and brought to 
nothing, so let the great, strong, precious building be 
destroyed and torn in two when the hour has come. 

(26) Thus sounds the mocking song, "Woe to him 
who is stingy to the misfortune of his house," that is, how 
sore it will turn out, how they will mock thee, that thou 
hast been so cruelly stingy to build thy house, and to 
make the city of Babylon strong and firm. What is the 
use? It is nothing, but that thou cause the more mischief 
to thyself and to thy house. For if thou buildest much, 
much shall be broken; if thou spendest much, much shall 
be lost, and thy shame and loss shall be the greater, 
because thou shalt be destroyed with such a beautiful 
building; and thou shalt have built in vain, so that all the 
world shall mock thee, saying, Where is the goodly 
building? Where is the strong city that would be safe 
from the whole world? How useful has such food and 
labor been? How finely it has been preserved! All the 
world has throbbed and defied it, and it is so shamefully 
won and destroyed. It would have been less misfortune 
and disgrace if they had not built so firmly, and had not 
been so stingy, so hard-working, and had not done so 
much harm to make themselves strong. 

27 Did it not happen the same way in the next 
uprising? There were castles and houses that had 
previously wanted to surrender to the Turk; but since the 
peasants only knocked, they went away. 


1478 Erl. 42, 75-77. interpretations on the prophets. W. 


VI, 3177-3179. 1479 





there. Why? Were they not strong enough? Certainly, but 
the right builder and protector were missing, he was not 
at home. That's why neither a building nor a hat helped. 
One does not yet want to recognize it, so blind and hard 
is the human heart. 

28 By saying, "He who is stingy," he shows how the 
king of Babylon did not build his edifice with proper 
goods, but stinted the land and the people, that is, he did 
not let him have the cheap and fair income of the land 
and the people, but put on them tax money, building 
money, estimated here and estimated there with various 
surcharges, as it is customary to do. When lords 
undertake great buildings, it is over the common man; so 
that this saying may be painted and written over all such 
buildings: "Woe to him who is stingy to the misfortune of 
his house. For it does not end well what is built with 
unrighteous goods, especially if one also wants to rely on 
it, and does not have God in mind as the right protector. 

29 Thus, when he says, "That he may lay his nest on 
high, that he may escape the calamity," he indicates that 
this building was done for a fortress against the enemies. 
For he felt in his conscience that he did not have much 
good prayer among the common people, because of his 
tyranny, avarice, and arrogance, so he had to be afraid, 
and could trust no one, but worried about accidents 
everywhere. To prevent and ward off this, he sows and 
calls on wood and stone, builds and fortifies himself with 
the same, which shall protect him. But it is a miserable 
guard and protection, where stone and wood are to 
guard, since God and men abandon and hate, as the 
tyranny, even much have known. 

(30) He calls the kingdom "a nest," and its fortress 
"the height," and its security "escaping the accident. For 
thus speaks the Hebrew language, that it calls dwellings 
or houses nests, which the birds, especially what are 
great birds, as the hawk, the sparrowhawk, the eagle, are 
wont to make high, that they may be secure to hedge, 
feed, and keep their young. So do the rich and great 
lords, as Obadiah, v. 4, also says of Esau: "If you make 
your nest among the stars 


| will cast you down, saith the LORD. For even if we build 
and create for a long time, it is no more than a nest that 
we have on earth, even if it were the world's good, in 
which we nurture and wait for our young. Next to it 
comes some animal or accident, and spoils nest and 
young with each other, or is taken away with young and 
with all. So it goes with the temporal life and being; it is 
temporal, and must go as it comes. 


V. 10. But the council will be a disgrace to your 
house. 


(31) That is, such building and fortifying is in vain, as 
it has been said that the harm and shame will only be 
the greater, because it is a man's counsel and 
undertaking, without God and His counsel. "Your 
counsel," he says, as if to say, O you attack it almost 
wisely, and suggest it 1) well with your building and 
fortifying. But they are own suggestions, as one says: It 
is an oak attack; as one wants to say: It is an own attack; 
as one says: Oak leaves stink; as one wants to say: Own 
praise stinks; therefore all own counsels are certainly 
missing. But one's own counsel means that which God 
does not give, and one's own reasoning and thinking, of 
which all Scripture says that they are in vain; as 1 Cor. 
3:20: "God knows the counsels of men to be vain"; and 
again 1 Cor. 1:19: "I will reject the wisdom of the 
prudent." And the whole of Ecclesiastes Solomon rejects 
such vain 2) suggestions. For man is vain, (that is,) 
nothing; therefore his counsels are nothing. But the 
counsel of the Lord stands [Ps. 33, 11]. 

32 So this attack of the Babylonians was with all 
shame, for they thought it was an everlasting kingdom. 
But before they knew it, it lay in ashes. The Romans also 
thought that their empire would last forever, and they 
had much advice and counsel about it, but it is all gone. 
And still today | see no fine carnival play, for the pope,

How many times have they failed and are still lacking, so 
that one can grasp it, as it goes according to the second 
Psalm, v. 2, 4, 5. How many times they have failed, and 
still fail, that one can grasp it, as it goes according to the 
2nd Psalm, v. 2. 4. 5: "The kings rebel, and princes 
counsel against Christ. But the Lord in heaven mocks 
them" 2c. But they do not stop because of this, although 
they often become lies and disgrace, so that they even 
go to ruin with sins and disgrace; as also the same 
Psalm, v. 10, says: "His wrath will soon burn. 


V.10. For you have broken too many nations, and 
have sinned with all your might. 


33 Therefore, he says, your strong building will not 
help. For thou hast done too much, God and man are 
enemies to thee, because thou hast been so tyrannical, 
and hast so violently oppressed the people, and taken 
their goods unto thee. And Habakkuk stirred his 
conscience with these words, that he might terrify him 
with the wrath of God. For when he says, "You have 
crushed too many nations," he shows the greatness of 
their sins, that he has crushed too many, and the 
crushing here means that he has crushed their goods 
and made their food scarce, so that he might be rich and 
have strong dwellings. Just as it happens to people who 
are so oppressed with goods and services that they do 
not want them; their food is also shortened, and it is just 
as much as if they were damaged and crushed by 
robbers. 

34 And when he says, "And you have sinned with all 
your might," in Hebrew it means, "And you have sinned 
with your soul," which means, to sin with all your might, 
so that one immediately cools his evil temper with people, 
and it does him good and good to exercise such pride, as 
if his soul, that is, his life, were in it. In the same way, 
Ezekiel Cap. 25, 15: "The Philistines have smelled 
themselves with their souls," that is, from the heart, and 
to cool their courage. Also Exodus 15:9: "My soul shall 
be filled," that is, | will cool my temper with them. The king 
also did this. Where one is aware of his avarice 


Interpretation of Habakkuk (1.), Cap. 2, 10. 11. W. VI, 3179-3182. 





1481 


and treasures, he dealt with them in such a way that he 
also cooled his temper and exercised all his courage 
over them, just as we now see our bishops and tyrants 
dealing with the poor people. 


V. 11 For even the stones in the wall will cry out, 
and the beams on the bars will answer them. 


35 How is this done? Is this the strong city and the 
high nest, where the stones and beams shout and crash 
against and over their master? If the house itself is 
repugnant to the owner, what will the enemies do? One 
would like to hear the words that the stones and beams 
are the king's own people and subjects, who should 
stand by him and help him, but he has taken it so with 
them that they themselves are against him, leave him in 
his distress, shout about him, and fall to the enemies, 
and help the same; Just as a house that cracks and 
bursts startles and frightens the inhabitant, so that he is 
more afraid of the house inside than outside, and just 
where he should seek and have protection and safety, 
he must flee from it the most. Therefore, it is not a good 
curse to say, "Let an old wall slay you. 

(36) But | think that the prophet is reaching into the 
conscience of the king and his people, and that this is 
the opinion that his best and strongest building should 
not only be lost and in vain, but should also be harmful 
and against himself. For when his enemies fought 
against him, God gave him such a stupid, despondent 
courage that not only his building but also the whole 
world became too narrow for him, and where a beam or 
pillar cracked on the house, he thought that enemies 
were falling in. 

For God can fight so masterfully that he first takes 
away heart and courage; as he says of him Ps. 76:13: 
"He is terrible among the kings of the earth, and takes 
away the courage of the princes. When the heart and 
courage are gone, the manhood is gone, and the man 
becomes cowardly and despondent; he does no good, 
and is of no use except to be beaten like a block. Even 
if he had all the walls and ramparts before him, with all 
kinds of defenses, it would not help. 


1482 Erl. 42, 79-82. Interpretations On the Prophets. W. VI, 


SI82-3185. 1483 





When he hears the crash of a beam, he is frightened and 
thinks that it is falling on him with stones. So Habakkuk 
also wants to say here that the king should become so 
cowardly in his distress that his own building, on which 
he relied, should frighten and afflict him, if only a stone 
on the wall cries, that is, cracks, and the beams answer, 
that is, that stones and beams crack one after the other, 
or with each other. All this is taught by experience when 
a fearful, despondent person is alone in a house, for 
example, as he is frightened when a piece of wood 
cracks in the wall, and sometimes thinks he hears or 
sees what he neither sees nor hears. 

38 Is this not a marvelous judgment of God, that this 
great king, who had conquered all the world, and was a 
terror to everyone, should turn back? that he should 
become so despondent when his hour comes, that he is 
not only uncertain in the land, but even his own building 
should frighten him with a crash in the lock? That is, of 
course, to chase one with a skinny bladder and three 
peas. Where is now the high solid nest? What is the use 
of big money, which has been wasted by all countries, to 
build a strong castle? | think that avarice has smelled that 
such fortresses turn back, and do as much with crashing 
alone as the enemies do with weapons. This is what 
happens to him who is stingy and builds with contempt 
for God, so that such construction does not result in 
happiness or salvation, but, as he says here, in 
misfortune and disaster for himself, with great disgrace. 
That is, wanting to be strong, and not in God. 

39 So princes and lords should do, if they wanted to 
build fortresses 1) that they lay a right good foundation, 
that is, that they should first ask God for heart and 
courage, which could preserve the building in time of 
need, so that a castle would stand firmly on a right 
foundation. But since courage is not provided, but only 
wood and stone are erected, it must finally, when the 
hour comes, go, as the text says here, that a cracking of 
spars and a crashing of stones frightens them. | mean, 
we have also experienced this this year at the strong 
castles, so the peasants disturbed in the uproar.

Woe to him who builds the city with blood and 
builds the city with injustice. 


40 The third mocking song is about the beautiful 
building, so that the whole city was adorned and 
decorated for pleasure. For when he had plenty of money 
and goods, he first built his house, that is, his castle, solid 
and exquisite, as we have heard. Then he adorned the 
city with many beautiful buildings, much of which is 
written about how the king built Babylon. And among 
other things, it is said to be a great miracle that he led 
the great water Euphrates through the city; although the 
Greeks attribute this to Queen Semiramis, but they have 
little reason for it. For Daniel writes [Cap. 4, 27] how the 
king boasted that he had prepared the city of Babylon; 
item, the great pleasure gardens, 2) which he had built 
for the queen on high on vaults above the roofs, of which 
Josephus writes. How then the kings use to build much 
useless building:: whom: they have too much money, as 
those in Egypt with their large tops, towers and graves 
2c. 

(41) Such a beautiful, glorious, delicious building, 
says Habakkuk, will all become a mockery and a 
disgrace. Why? Because he does all this with the sweat 
and blood of the poor, with unrighteous goods, won by 
means of tribulations and strangulation. Because, as we 
have heard, he had to win such great lands and people 
with much bloodshed and injustice, without any hardship. 
That is why Habakkuk says here that he built the city by 
or with blood, because the money was acquired by 
bloodshed, and he wronged the people with it. And Micah 
the prophet speaks almost the same words against the 
kings of the Jews, when he says Cap. 3:10: "Ye build 
Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity," which 
seems to have been a common speech among the 
prophets against the tyrants. 

V. 13. Is it not so, that it shall come to pass from the

For where such great inhumane buildings are built, 
there must be many people who work on them; which 
work is of two kinds: one, of those who must give 
treasure for it, so that it may be built; the other, of those 
who must indulge in it and work with their own bodies. 
Both are difficult for the people, and they become lenient 
about it. So the tyrants of the people need work for their 
pleasure. But now, build freshly and make it fine, force 
the people and make them weary; it shall come to pass 
that we shall sing of thee, saying, Behold, the beautiful, 
delicious building is prepared only that the fire may 
consume the more; and in it the people must be weary, 
it is erected only that the empty, desolate courtyard 1) 
may become the greater. For thus it is said in Hebrew: 


Quae populi laboraverunt, in abundantia ignis 
erunt, et in quo lassati sunt, in abundantia inanitatis 


erit. For this is also what is said when one speaks 
mockingly of a great work, that it is undertaken in vain 
and does not end up where one thinks it will. For 
nowhere has the papacy accumulated so much good as 
to be taken away from it, and for this reason alone has 
it risen so high that it has fallen so low. So one would 
also scoff, if a lord made many bulwarks and fences 
around his castle, and yet the work was lost: It is good, 
let him build, it will be good fireworks out of it; that is so 
much said: It is a fool, the more he builds, the more he 
makes others burn. 

43 Thus he also mocks the great king's building here. 
As if to say: O, you are building a beautiful thing; but 
what a beautiful fire it will be, now that so many people 
are working on it; and how many fine, unadorned 
courtyards 2) there will be, now that so many people are 
working on it, and your plan will turn around and not turn 
out as you want. If you want it to be an ornament and a 
decoration of the city, it shall become an unornament 
and a deformity, so that one finds a desolate burnt place 
where you are now building pleasure gardens. But this 
shall not be done by the subjects.

that there is no rebellion, but "from the LORD of hosts"; 
he will certainly find people for it, namely the Persians 
and Medes. And this is indeed a very fine judgment. He 
smote many people, and weakened and diminished their 
food, that his building might be great, and full, and 
strong; and he shall be again so diminished and 
weakened, that his building shall lie in ashes upon 
desolate places of fire. And because he hath built it with 
blood and iniquity, he will not wash it away with water, 
but burn it out with fire pure, that blood and iniquity be 
no more found there. 

44 But how difficult it was to believe all this, since it 
was said and not yet seen, that such a mighty thing 
should be destroyed with fire. Therefore the spirit must 
be here, which speaks it, and also teaches to believe 
with the Jews. For the Babylonians would have mocked 
if they had heard it, and 3) especially because such 
punishment was to come "from the LORD of hosts," that 
is, from the Jews' God, whom they despised, as they 
destroyed his people. Just as it was a mockery to the 
Jews and Romans that Christ, the crucified God, should 
disturb them, whom they daily killed his saints; and now 
it is still a mockery to our Junkers that the God should 
do something to them, whose word is now preached, 
because they daily persecute it. 


V. 14 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge 
of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea. 


45 The prophets took this saying from Moses, who 
says, Ex 9:16.This is why | raised you up, that | might

in all the earth," that is, you despise me as an 
incompetent god of a wretched people, who is not highly 
renowned; well, | will let you see a little, so that | will not 
be despised and held in low esteem, but all the earth will 
sing and speak of my power. Item, Deut. 14:21: "As |

tempt me and dishonor me; | will be

But to prove it in you, and to attack you, that the world 
may be filled with my glory, that is, that they may sing of 
me, say of me, praise me, honor me, and fear me in all 
places, when they hear what | have done to you, whom 
you have so tempted. Isaiah also speaks of the kingdom 
of Christ, Cap. 11, 9: "The earth is full of the knowledge

world hears the gospel of Christ abundantly, and learns 
to know God in it. One must get used to speaking in this 
way. For they call it "full of honor" when one sings, 
preaches and says about God everywhere. As if one 
said of the great Alexander or Julio Caesare: "All the 
world praises the heroes, and their praise resounds in all 
places from their great deeds. 

46 Habakkuk also rebuked the king of Babylon, 
saying, "You despise the LORD of hosts, our God, as if 
he were a mere fly compared to your God, because you 
do such great things, thinking that your God gives it to 
you, and that our God must suffer such things in us. But 
thou shalt see in a little while that our despised God shall 
also once honor thee and thy God, and deal with thee in 
such a way that all the world shall sing of it and say, 
mocking thee and thy God, but praising and extolling our 
God at all ends, as having done this to thee. All this was 
done in this way. For when Cyrus king of Persia had 
destroyed Babylon, he publicly confessed and 
proclaimed with writings in all the lands that the God from 
heaven who dwelt in Jerusalem had given him such 
victory, power and kingdom. Therefore, in thanksgiving, 
he again built the temple in Jerusalem with his own food 
and money, as Ezra writes in Cap. 1:2 ff. 

47 That is, as the sea is full of water, so shall the 
world be full of the glory of the LORD of hosts; that is, 
such glory as is not like a brook full of water, which can 
be dried up or cut off 1) but like the sea full of water, 
which no one can dry up or cut off. So this honor and 


glory

of God go so mightily in all lands that no one can keep 
him silent nor hinder him. All this, as said, is proclaimed 
to comfort the Jewish people and to keep them in the 
faith. 


V. 15: Woe to you who pour out your neighbor's 
drink and mix in your anger and make them drunk, so 
that their shame Is seen. 


This is the fourth mocking song, about his pride and 
iniquity. Good makes courage, they say. When tyrants 
are firmly established, when they have good and honor 
enough, when they have strong and merry houses, they 
still do not let them use them, but become proud and 
wicked, to exercise all kinds of violence and will of 
courage, they do not want to suffer nor listen, and where 
their mind is not on it, there is vain raging and choking. 
Read in Daniel Cap. 3, 1. ff. how this king erected a 
golden pillar and forced the people to worship it. Item, 
Cap. 2, 1. ff., how he wanted his dream to be guessed 
and interpreted by the wise men and scholars of 
Babylon, you will find out what kind of herb he was. He 
was a fine, prudent tyrant, who wanted his will to be 
taken for a king; in addition, he was highly intelligent and 
clever, who did not want to be rejected with words, nor 
to be led by the nose, but wanted to go through with the 
scholars, since they could not tell him the dream, and still 
meet the interpretation requirements. He probably 
thought that it would have to be a ruse. 

49 Here we have to get used to the Hebrew way of 
speaking, which is almost rich in speaking with twisted 
words and similes. Thus we have just heard in the 
second chapter [Cap. 3, § 3] how the king of Babylon is 
accused of being a drunkard, who drinks up all the lands. 
There, "to drink" means as much as to take from others 
what is theirs, to rob and to snatch to oneself, as Christ 
also says of the Pharisees Matth. 23, 14, "that they 
devour widows' houses,” and in Job the same custom is 
also in words. But here, in this and similar places, to drink 
or to make drunk is as much as to suffer misfortune; and 
to pour or to give to drink is as much as to punish, to 
torment, to torture, and to inflict all kinds of plagues. 
Hence the common word in the Psalter, the cup of the 
Lord; item, her cup. 


1488 Erl. 42, 86-88. 


Interpretation of Habakkuk (1.), cap. 2, 15. W. VI, 3190-3193. 


1489 





is full of sulfur. Revelation 18:6, 7. It is also written about 
the red harlot: "Pour out to her as she has poured out to 
you," and measure her with the measure that she has 
measured you with. So the cup of the Lord is called the 
punishment, which he pours out and apportions to each 
one. Read Jer. 25:15, 16, where it says, "All kings and 
all men drink of the cup of the LORD, that they may drink, 
and spit, and fall. 

(50) And that we may understand it fully and clearly, 
when one is drunk with wine in the flesh, he is a good 
example of two other drunkennesses. One is when 
someone becomes drunk with great pleasure. The other 
is when someone is drunk with great pain. Just as a 
person who is drunk in the flesh presents himself, so do 
the other two. A physically drunk person staggers, falls 
down, spits, talks foolishly, and is insolent, as we see 
every day. So also, if one is too well, has good and 
honor, lust and violence enough, he is a quite drunken 
man, he does not know what to do for courage, he 
staggers, falls, spits, washes, acts impudently, that is, 
Even if he does shameful, blasphemous things, which 
are bad for him and are a disgrace, he does not inquire, 
there is no fear, shyness or measure, he is covered 
behind and in front, that is, one can see his 
unrighteousness and disgrace everywhere: Nor does he 
pass through, nor pay any attention to him; as we also 
see now in our tyrants. The king of Babylon was also 
drunk with delight and pleasure, as is said above in 3. 
Here it is great prudence who can avoid such a drunken 
man, as it is said, "Even a cartload of hay should go out 
of the way of a drunken man. For fools are not to be dealt 
with. 

51 Again, he who is drunk with pain also acts like a 
drunken man, staggering and going astray, complaining, 
crying out, and talking so badly that nothing but shame 
is seen in him. Some blaspheme both God and man, go 
out with impatience, also expose everything they are, 
what they know, and is vain foolish, unreasonable being 
there, like a drunken man. 

52] In this way Habakkuk speaks of the king of Babylon, 
that he was much drunk. 





He himself was full and drunk with pleasure, that is, he 
was a wanton tyrant and afflicted many people, and 
especially oppressed the Jewish people, without any 
mercy; as Isaiah Cap. 47, 6. Says to Babylon, "When | 
was wroth with my people, | made my inheritance foul, 
and delivered them into thine hand: but thou hadst no 
mercy upon them"; item. Zach. 1, 15: "I am angry with 
the great nations. For | was a little angry, but they help 
to mischief"; that is, | only wanted to punish, so they 
even want to destroy my people, and make it too much 
for me. But God's judgment is such that he who is drunk 
in the first way must also become drunk in the other way; 
as this prophet says that the king became drunk with all 
the people's goods, and made many drunk with grief; 
therefore they will mock him again, and sing and say in 
all countries how he also became drunk. Just as Isaiah 
Cap. 14, 10. says of him: "And you also are slain like us" 
(say the Gentiles), that is, you have crushed us, | mean, 
you are hit again and also crushed. Yes, who could hope 
for such a thing! It is especially high and unbelievable 
when the tyrants sit in the nest. 

(53) Now this is what Habakkuk says here: You have 
filled your neighbor 1) and made him drunk. And so that 
no one doubts that he is talking about the other, that is, 
about the drunkenness of pain, he points to himself and 
says: "and mix your anger with it". This is said plainly 
enough, that he drank the people with the cup of his 
wrath, that is, with wanton tyranny, and made them 
ashamed, that one saw their shame, that is, he robbed 
them of all honors, that they became poor, captives, 
tormented people, of whom one has nothing glorious to 
say. 

The prophet refers to the history of Genesis 9:21: 
"When Noah was drunk and lying naked, his shame was 
seen. This means nothing else than shameful suffering 
and misfortune. For to be subdued, to gain good and 
honor, is a glorious thing in the sight of the world, but to 
be subjected to the enemy, to be poor and to be shamed. 


1) Erlanger: probably. 


1490 Er. 42, 88-S1. Interpretationdn on the prophets. w. vi, 31S3-3IS5. 


To be put to shame is a shameful thing. That is why it is 
called "seeing the shame" when one is overcome, 
corrupted and impoverished, and how this king had 
disgraced the Jews and many countries, and he kept the 
victory and the honor as a hero. 


V. 16. You will also be filled with shame for honor. 


This is: You will be made drunk again and made 
drunk, so that your shame will also be seen. For you also 
must be overcome, that your power may be destroyed 
and put to shame. Then thou shalt be filled with shame 
and filled for glory, that is, instead of the great honor and 
glory which thou now hast, thou shalt have vain shame, 
and wedged glory. And all this will be sung of thee with 
joy, and mocked, and laughed at thee. For everyone is 
pleased with you, and you deserve it. 


So now you also drink so that you stagger. 


(56) This is what drunkards do, so that they stagger 
and have nowhere to stand. Those who are full of pain 
and suffering do not know where to stay, and if the wide 
world is too narrow for them, they know neither advice 
nor help. This is also what he wishes and proclaims to 
this king, that the Persians and Medes will come and 
pour out heartache and all misfortune on him, so that he 
will have to drink and stagger until he can neither stand 
nor stay anywhere. Psalm 60:5 says: "You make the 
people see a hard thing, and you water us with 
staggering wine,” that is, with wine that makes us 
stagger, so that we do not know where to stay. And 
Isaiah Cap. 51:22, "Behold, | have taken from thine hand 
the cup of staggering, and the cup of my wrath." Item, 
therein, v. 17. "Make thee fast, O Jerusalem, which hast 
drunk of the LORD the cup of his wrath; unto the ground 
hast thou drained the goblet, and unto the lees." From 
these and similar sayings it is easy to see what the 
prophets mean by such words when they say drink the 
cup, stagger, and what their manner of speaking was. 


For you will be surrounded by the cup in the right 
hand of the Lord. 





1491 


57 That is, you cannot resist nor escape the cup and 
the accident. For the Lord has become your gift, he will 
give it to you to drink, and you must drink it, there is no 
help for it; who can resist God? If it were man's will and 
counsel to give thee drink, thou mightest find help and 
counsel; but now the LORD himself sends thee such, 
thou must be ready. For the cup shall surround thee 
round about, that thou shalt not be able to resist it. Now 
all this is easy to understand from what has been said 
before. 


And must spit shamefully for your glory. 


(58) Just as you have violently drunk up much land 
and people, and have become drunk and angry, so you 
must shamefully spit it out again and give it back. The 
Book of Job also speaks in this way, that the wicked 
must spit out again what they have stolen, which tasted 
sweet when they drank it and took it. For it is true that to 
drink wine is sweet and good; but to spit again is bitter 
and grievous. So robbery and all sin are sweet in fact, 
but bitter in punishment. Habakkuk therefore says that 
the king must not only spit again what he has stolen, but 
must also be disgraced by it, so that it becomes a 
shameful spitting, in which all the world will mock and 
laugh at him, because he must lose it again. And this "for 
his glory" is: As great as your glory is now, because you 
drink and rob; so great will be your shame when you spit 
and lose it again. 


V. 17 For the iniquity committed in Lebanon shall 
overtake thee, and the distressed beasts shall terrify 
thee. 

59 This is what is said above in §36 ff. He will have 
neither heart nor courage, but will be despondent and 
feel that it is not the wrath of man, but the cup of the 
Lord. For his conscience will resist him and punish him 
"for the transgression committed against Lebanon. Then 
Mount Lebanon will come to Babylon, even if it were far 
from it; yes, it will come into his chamber and into his 
heart, and will oppress his conscience and make it 
cowardly, along with all the animals that it has brought 
there. 


1492 En. 42, 91-93. interpretation of Habakkuk (1.), Cap. 2, 17-19. 


W. VI, 3195-3198. 1493 





has disturbed itself. How does this happen? The 
conscience feels this, and thinks that Lebanon is there 
with all his beasts, and they want to devour him, whom 
he has offended before. For sin, when repentance 
comes, brings it with it, and puts, yes, presses into the 
heart with force all those who are offended. Some 
interpret here "Lebanon" the temple at Jerusalem 2c., 
but | hold, he calls the whole country thus from the 
mountain Lebanon. Just as the 42nd Psalm, v. 7, calls it 
from the mountain Hermonim and from the water Jordan, 
when it says: "| remember you in the land of Jordan and 
the mountain Hermonim." For Lebanon is also the same 
mountain Hermon. This is the meaning: You have done 
great evil in the land of Lebanon, that is, in the land of 
Judah, and have disturbed the animals in it, that is, the 
people and the inhabitants; therefore such evil will 
oppress you and your conscience, and you will have to 
suffer the same and much more. 


For the blood of men, and for iniquity, in the land, 
and in the city, and committed upon all that dwell 
therein. 

The text has already been interpreted above [§ 17 ff]. 
For the prophet particularly points out the sin and iniquity 
he committed not only against Lebanon and the whole 
country, but most of all in the land of Judah and against 
the city of Jerusalem. 


v.18. What good is the image that his master has 
made? And the false cast image, on which his master 
relies, -that he worships dumb idols? 

The fifth song of mockery is about his worship. There 
the prophet of the king mocks very vehemently and with 
stinging words. For these are vain and very wicked 
words, when he says: The king has made an image 1) 
of God, and he is the master of such an image and of 
God, and yet he worships his own work. How could one 
be a greater fool? Pfni of God and worship, since the 
God is an image, and the worshiper is a master of the 
God he worships. Item, since he says: It is a false image, 


1) In the original: Images. 





that is, a deceit and a lie, so that people are deceived 
into thinking that they serve God, and rely on such lies 
and deceit rather than on the real truth. Item, that he 
worships dumb idols, which cannot speak, but do or 
make anything. 


022 Therefore now he defieth, and saith, Alas, how 
well then shall thy God leave thee! if the cup of the LORD 
come upon thee, what shall it do thee? For it is an idol 
and an image. But still, let him help, call upon him, let us 
see how he will stand to help thee. Our God, even if he 
punishes us for a while, will redeem us again; but your 
God will never help you. | think Habakkuk means by this 
text, among other images and idols, the most prominent 
idol in Babylon, which is called Bel. For Isaiah calls the 
two highest, Bel and Nebo [Isa. 46:1]. To the same Bel 
he set up the great golden image, since Daniel writes 
Cap. 3, 1. that it was sixty cubits high and six cubits wide. 
The people had a great deal of useless gold. That is why 
the empire was so great and rich, and had seized the 
goods of all the countries. 


Woe to him who says to the wood, "Wake up!" and 
to the dumb stone, "Get up! 


(63) This is the mockery that shall be sung and said 
in the time of distraction: "Now call upon your wood and 
stone, which you have made and held to be gods; how 
wickedly and shamefully they leave you! For though thou 
call upon them, saying, Help my God, watch over my 
Bel, stand up my Nebo, save me; he heareth not, 
because he is wood and stone overlaid with gold. 


Should he teach? 


That is, how should he like to give good advice? After 
all, it is a mute stone. It is fitting for a true God to teach 
and counsel his people with his words. 


Behold, he is covered with gold and silver, and 
there is no spirit in him. 


65. a poor, wretched god, who lets himself be 
grasped and caught in gold, and has no breath nor life 
in him. Such mockery and 


1494 kn. 42, s3-ss. Interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3IS8-320I. 


The prophet is comforting the Jewish people that they 
should be sure of their salvation, as has been said, so 
that they would not fall into unbelief and become angry 
at God's work and words, for which they had great cause 
and movement, because Babylon was so powerful and 
so firmly established, and they were so completely 
abandoned and disturbed. 


V. 20. But the LORD is in his holy temple, let all the 
earth be still before his face. 


(66) He is not wrought or set in silver or gold, but "is 
in his temple," that is, in his palace and royal hall, which 
is heaven, and where he dwells by his word; and yet so 
mighty and glorious that all the world must fear him, and 
be still, that he may do with them according to his will; 
that is, he is almighty, and rules as far as the world [is]. 
This may well be a true God. For though pagans and 
heretics rage and rage against him with violence and 
doctrine, he lets it happen for a while; but soon he can 
let them see a little, that they all perish and come to 
nothing, and so must be quiet before him when he 
comes. For this little word, "before him," or "before his 
face," in Hebrew is thus much as when he comes, or 
turns his face toward us, as he who is coming, as in [1] 
John it is written, "Behold, | send my angel before your 
face," that is, before your future, or when you come. So 
Habakkuk wants to say: "When our God comes and 
visits home, then all the world will be quiet. For then 
everyone will turn away, and pride and boasting and all 
exaltation will cease. 


1495 


muth. For he punishes the wicked and helps the pious. 
Thus he makes it bad and quiet wherever he goes. No 
other God can do that. 

67 Let this be enough of Habakkuk's prophecy. There 
we see how many words it takes to keep the faith in 
people, especially when they are weak, and the 
temptation is strong and powerful, as it was among the 
Jewish people. How he has punished, pleaded, fought, 
prophesied, admonished and comforted; in turn, he has 
crushed Babylon, mocked it, and grieved it with God's 
judgment and wrath. Yet few have been helped, for faith 
is not for everyone [2 Thess. 3:2]. 

(68) Now he adds a prayer, made in the manner of 
Sanglied, to comfort and strengthen the weak in faith 
even more, and reads and records many of the ancient 
miracles of God, which he demonstrated to the people 
in the past and so often miraculously delivered them, so 
that they may remember them and not doubt that their 
God, who delivered them so often and so mightily 
before, will also now deliver them from Babylon again. 
For it almost strengthens the heart and the faith when 
one remembers the previous miracles, as the prophet 
often confesses in the Psalter, and says [Ps. 119, 52]: 
"Lord, | remembered your judgments, and was 
comforted"; item [Ps. 77, 12. 13.]: "Il remember your 
miracles of old, and speak of your doings." So also the 
pious Judith comforted her citizens, Judith 8, 19. 20., 
and Matathia his sons, the Maccabees, saying, 
"Remember how our fathers are redeemed 2c. [Let us 
now see the same song, the title of which is thus: 


The fourth chapter. 


Cap. 3:1 This is the prayer of the prophet 
Habakkuk for the innocent. 
1 David in the seventh Psalm, v. 1, also uses such a title, 
since he presents his innocence to God. But in Hebrew 
it reads as much as ignorantia et ignorantiae, 
Ignorance, ignorance, Ignorance, Ignorance. 


The word inconscientia is, if one could speak in Latin, 


inconscience, when one is not aware of something, or 


has no conscience, as David does in _ the 


aforementioned Psalm. Since Shimei blamed him [2 
Sam. 16, 7. ff.], he would have taken the kingdom from 
Saul hv farce 


1496 Erl. 42, 9S-S7. Interpretation of Habakkuk (1.), Cap. 3, 1. 2. 


W. VI, 3201-3204. 1497 





he indicates that [it] is not in his conscience, and calls it 


ignorantia, which we must German "Unschuld" 
("innocence") for lack of a better word. But it is too 
strong. For this is much more humble and Christian, that 
one should not boast of innocence before God, but of 
conscience. For a person may feel no evil in his 
conscience, but still not be innocent, as Paul says in 1 
Corinthians 4:4: "| am conscious of nothing, but in this | 
am not righteous; but the Lord will judge me." Just as 
Abimelech was without conscience when he took Sarah, 
and yet the work was wrong before God, Gen. 20, 3. ff. 

2 So Habakkuk also wants to pray for the pious who 
were led to Babylon together with the wicked, when 
there were undoubtedly many pious people among 
them, like Daniel with his companions. These were 
innocent, that is, they had no conscience and were not 
aware of any evil deed, but nevertheless had to go with 
them, because God judged them, as St. Paul says. For 
God Himself confesses Jer. 25, 29.Z) that they did not 
deserve such a cup to drink. Now call it innocence, or 
ignorance, or free conscience, or however anyone 
wants; if the sense is there, one may have patience with 
the word. So | think we Germans speak best: "A prayer 
for the innocent." 


V. 2. 2) Lord, | have heard your rumor, and | am 
afraid. 


(3) He begins the prayer with praise and thanksgiving, 
as a good prayer should do. For he counts therefore 
many great wonders, which God proved to the fathers, 
and says: "I have heard many things about you, for our 
fathers told us, and left them behind in writings, as the 
44th Psalm, v. 2, also does, and says: "God, we have 
heard with our ears, our fathers have told us" 2c. Such 
your rumor and preaching of yourself makes that 


1) Here the Jena edition, which is certainly wrong: Jer. 20. This 

has Walch reprinted and from Walch the Erlangen edition instead of 
Jer. 25, which is found in the original, the Wittenberg and the Latin 
edition. 
2) In the original, "the title" is not counted as a verse, therefore only 
here the heading: "The first verse" is found and so on with each 
following verse. But we have kept the counting of our Bible just like 
Walch. 


| am afraid, that is, | think highly of thee, and fear thee, 
and despise thee not, as the wicked do, who hear not of 
thee, nor know, or hear with unbelief, and let it pass. 


For thou makest thy work alive in the midst of the 
years, and makest it known in the midst of the years. 
When there is tribulation, you remember mercy. 


This is "the rumor" that makes people fear you and 
think much of you. For it is said of you, as the histories 
also testify, that you are such a wonderful God who 
helps in the midst of adversity. You let fall and pick up; 
you let break when you want to build and kill when you 
give life [1 Sam. 2, 6. ff.], you do not do like the world, 
which quickly resists the accident in the beginning, or 
even gets stuck in it; but you let us drive into the middle 
of it, and still you pull us out. Thou wilt give us the 
kingdom of Christ, and wilt drive us into the midst of 
Babylon, into the hole of service; yet wilt thou not leave 
us in. Thus doest thou in all thy works; it is thy way; thus 
singest, and hearest, and sayest of thee, that thou art 
indeed a God to be feared and honored with high praise 
in such works. 

5 The text here is obscure, that is, very Hebrew, 
therefore many have stumbled in it. To bring the work to 
life" is nothing else, "than to help in trouble. For he who 
is in trouble is almost as though he were dead, and when 
he is helped, it is as though he were alive and born 
again. 

(6) "In the midst of the years" is just as much as in 
due time, that God does not come soon when the need 
arises, as if there were any time to come. Nor does the 
help remain forever outside, as if all time were over to 
help, but in the midst of time, that is, he knows well how 
to take care that he does not help too soon nor too long. 
For if he were to help too soon, we would not learn to 
despair of ourselves, and would remain presumptuous; 
if he were to help too slowly, we would not learn to 
believe, and would despair of him. But now that he 
meets the remedy, he also keeps us in the remedy. And 
in Hebrew it is not said in the midst of the years, as if 
something were the beginning, and 


1498 En. 42, 97-gg. Interpretations on the prophets. w. vi, 3204-3206. 


something the end, but intra vel inter annos, id est, suo 


tempore, that is, under the years or under the time he 
meets the hour when he should help. Just as | say, The 
sun is among the stars; not immediately in the middle of 
the stars, but mingled with other stars also; so also the 
hour of help is in the middle of the years, that is, among 
the years or under the time, so that he does not let all the 
years come to an end and leave forever, until there are 
no more years. 

007 But he saith, Among the years; not among the days. 
This means that he speaks from the heart of those who 
are in distress; for them a day is a year long, indeed, all 
time is long for them. For this reason also, because the 
year is the longest measure of time, because in one year 
the world always becomes new and old again through 
summer and winter, and again and again to another 
year, 2) that by the years one should understand the 
length of time. So, "Lord, you help among the years," that 
is, in the length; if it seems to us a very long time, then 
you come among the same length. And that he speaks 
of many years, he does so because he speaks of many 
miracles and works of God, each of which was done in 
his time and in his year, so that the years are as many 
as the works, and he always keeps his work so that he 
comes under the year's trouble, that is, in the length of 
the trouble. 

8) "To make alive" and "to make known" is almost one 
thing, without making alive is doing the miracle and the 
help; "to make known" is that one also feels it and has 
joy from it. And "when there is tribulation,” that is in 
Hebrew: in turbatione, that is, even in the midst of 
trouble, when the rope holds hardest, that the trembling 
and shaking is greatest, then, saith he, remember thou 
mercy, that thou mayest help. Whoever wants to be 
saved must learn to know you in this way. To the faithful 
it is comforting, but to the wicked it is unmistakable.

with the people of Israel, He came straight from the south 
to the Canaanites and struck them. Now this was as 
great a miracle that Israel should go out of Egypt through 
so many nations and deserts, and drive out so many 
people, as that they should be delivered out of Babylon; 
nevertheless it happened when the hour came. That 
God is called "the Holy One" in the Scriptures, one 
should be used to it. For where he is, there he sanctifies 
by his spirit. What is also called "Selah" is sufficiently 
said elsewhere, especially in the 68th Psalm. 3) 


4) The heavens were full of His praise, and the earth 
was full of His glory. 


(10) That is, with such work he made it to be said of 
him in all places, in the lands under heaven. And here 
again is a Hebrew eclipse, which reads thus: His praise 
covers the heavens: not above, but below. For the 
Psalter also calls it covering the heavens when clouds 
are on it. Now Habakkuk says: "God's praise resounded 
so thickly under the heavens in all places that if there 
had been clouds or fog, they would have covered the 
heavens. Which we call the sky to be full underneath, 
and is just that Moses says to Pharaoh 2 Mos. 9, 16: "I 
have raised you up, that | might prove my power in you, 
that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth." So 
also the Hebrew way of speaking of heaven is to make 
many heavens. For to every country, as far as it sees its 
part of heaven, it is called heaven of the same country; 
therefore we say in the Lord's Prayer: You are in the 
heavens, that is, in all the heavens, as far as the world 
is. So God's praise was in the heavens, which were 
above the same lands; and in which heaven was his 
praise, in the same land was also his glory.

V. 4, Shem's splendor was like light, shining from 
his hands. There was secretly his power. 


011 Hence it came to pass, that the heavens and the 
earth were full of his praise. For his power, that is, his 
kingdom, was secret among the people of Israel, for no 
one saw him; but since he was so marvelous, such 
works were like light, indicating his presence, and 
proceeded from him like the shining of the sun in the 
clouds, and like rays from his hands, that is, from his 
strength, which he demonstrated. For though the sun is 
hidden under the clouds, yet by the light it is known 
where it is; so these shines did not go out from the face 
of the Lord, he was hidden there, but from his hands, that 
is, by the works it was known that he was there. Then it 
was said that heaven and earth were filled with his 
praise. Such glories the Hebrew tongue calls "horns". 2 
Mos. 34, 2'9. ff. Moses had horns, that is. Shine in his 
face. 


V. 5 Pestilence went before him, and plague went 
out at his feet. 


012 This is the shining of one of his hands, when he 
smote the land of Egypt, that in one night all the firstborn 


were dead. That was Passover Domini, his walk, such 


footsteps he made where he stepped, pestilence went 
out at his feet [Ex. 12:27 ff]. 


V. 6: He stood and measured the land, and looked, 
and brake in pieces the nations, so that the mountains 
of the world were broken in pieces, 1) and the hills of 
the plain were bowed down, as he walked in the world. 


013 Another glory: When he was by the sea of red in 
the world, he stood between Israel and Egypt, and 
measured the land, so that the Egyptians could not go 
further than he had measured for them [Exodus 14:20]. 
In the morning he looked at them and cut them in two, 
so that their order was not only cut in two, but also the 
great princes, who are like mountains in the world, were 
drowned and crushed in the sea at a single sight, and 
had to stoop down and fall to the ground. 


1) In the old editions: worden. In Latin: aissixarsutur. 


The proud hills, the great Hansa, the hills of the world 
will be humbled before him, because he took such a wild 
walk among them on earth. 


V. 7 | saw the tents of the Moors in trouble, and the 
tents of the Midianites in distress. 


(14) This was a piece of his praise under heaven, that 
such great countries round about feared and were 
terrified at such a shining. Some do not want to have the 
huts of the Moors here, but because Chusan stands 
here, it should be the king of Mesopotamia, Chusan 
Risathaim, Richt. 3, 8. | leave them aside, it does not 
rhyme with the order. So one knows well that in Hebrew 
Chus and Chusan may be one thing, is to do one X. So 
also Moses sings in his hymn 2 Mos. 15, 14. 15. that all 
surrounding countries were afraid when they heard such 
work. That is, he says, "| saw (that is, one of them saw) 
how the Moors on the Red Sea, Egypt's neighbors, were 
afraid, in trouble, in pain and in fear; their other 
neighbors on the other side of the sea, the Midianites, 
were also like them; they were all afraid of the God of 
Israel, who thus dealt with Pharaoh. 


V. 8.2) Wouldest thou not be wroth, O LORD, in the 
flood, and thy wrath in the waters, and thy anger in the 
sea? When thou rodeest upon thy horses, and thy 
chariots were salvation. 


This verse may be understood in a yes way and ina 
no way. But | like the no way best, to speak according to 
the Hebrew tongue, that the opinion is this: The prophet, 
after he has told some miracles, makes a joyful noise to 
God and makes love to him, saying: "| mean that | was 
merciful and not angry when you rode on your horses in 
the flood of the sea and its waters and rode on your 
chariots, that is, on the horses and chariots of Israel. For 
thou wast there, and ledst them through, that there was 
salvation and victory. There was no anger or wrath that 
you could have felt. But whoever likes the words as they 
are interpreted there, must

ninth verse." The verse number of the following verses is then higher

pointing the anger and wrath at the Egyptians, whom 
he smote, that he might save his people. But let no 
one doubt that the children of Israel had horses and 
chariots. For they went forth armed, saith Moses, 
Exodus 13:18, as an army that goeth forth to war. 


V. 9. You raised your bow, as you had sworn to the 
tribes. Sela. 

16. by the bow he means the whole battle gear, 
like Ps. 78, 9. the children of Ephraim, who were to 
lead the bow. Now God had spoken Gen 49:24 
through the archfather Jacob that the bow of Ephraim 
should be firm 2c. Here Habakkuk swore to the tribes 
of Israel. And this verse indicates one of the glories 
that God had in mind, and may be the battle that 
Joshua did against the Amalekites, Ex. 17, 13, or 
against King Harad, or against the Midianites and 
Moabites, Ex. 31, 3. ff, or against King Sihon and Og 
[Cap. 21, 23. ff], or against all of them. For he wants 
to say how God awakened and strengthened their 
bow, so that they were blessed in the conflict. 


And divide the streams into the land. 

17. this is also a splendor, when he gave water 
from the rocks, that they flow in the desert divided, 
that both people and cattle could drink [4 Mos. 20, 2. 
ff]. 


V. 10: The mountains saw you, and they were 
afraid; the waters went down, the deep was heard, the 
high places lifted up their hands. 

018 Then he gathered together in one heap the 
works of glass, when the children of Israel were 
passed over Jordan. For then "the mountains were 
afraid," that is, the great lords of the land of Canaan, 
or the land that is all mountainous, with the people in 
it. As Moses also says in Exodus 15:15: "Then the 
princes of Edom were afraid, and the mighty men of 
Moab were afraid, and all the inhabitants of Canaan 
were troubled." At the same time, the Jordan River 
was also dried up, Jos. 3, 16. Item, "the deep was 
heard, and the high lifted up their hands," that is, 
everything that was deep and high was moved and 
moved away because of fear, neither the deep 
waters nor the high mountains could help anyone, 
everything had to give way and give space. 





V. 11. The sun and the moon stood in their dwelling 
place. 


19 That is, they stood still against their nature and 
custom, and served Joshua in battle, Josh. 10:13. 


Your arrows went with gleams, and your spears 
with glances of lightning. 

20] This is the story of God striking the nations 
with a great storm and hail at Azekah, Jos. 10:11; for 
the Scriptures call the hail and lightning of God 
arrows and spears, as Ps. 18:15:"He shot his arrows, 
and terrified them at Mount Sinai." Also one would 
probably like to call arrows and spears here, as it 
reads, and understand the battle that Joshua led 
against the cities of Makkedah, Libnah, Lachish, 
Eglon, Hebron, Debir, Jos. 10, 28. ff. For they were 
so easily won over one by one that it must have been 
said that the arrows and spears of the Israelites were 
God's, and that he shot and stabbed so mightily with 
them. But he saith, they gleam and shine. For so do 
weapons in battle, that they look and shine, which 
they do not in the sheath. And this is the 
interpretation | like best. 


V. 12. You trample the land in anger, and crush the 
nations in wrath. 


21 This happened when Joshua struck the rest of 
the kings by the waters of Merom, Jos. 11:7. 


V. 13 You went out to help the people, to help your 
anointed ones. 

(22) This happened in the days of Samuel, Saul, 
and David, when they went to battle, God helped 
them all the way, as the first and other books of Kings 
testify. 


V. 13 Thou hast broken the head of the house of the 
wicked, and stripped the foundation even to the neck. 
Sela. 


023 These heads and foundations are the kings of 
the countries round about, as Edom, Ammon, Syria, 
Philistim, which David overcame, and cast them 
under him. For this is called "the head broken", that 
is, the kingdom taken, that they had no head nor 


1504 Erl. 42, 104-107. interpretation of Habakkuk (1.), Cap. 3, 13-18. 


W. vi, 3212-3214. 1505 





They no longer had their own kings, but were David's 
subjects. It is the same thing that he stripped the 
foundation, that is, the kings and princes, down to the 
neck, so that the stocking and the body remained, 
and became David's subject. For a king is the head 
and foundation of a kingdom; the people and the land 
are the stockings and the body. So far away he has 
painted with thanksgiving and told the splendor of 
divine hands, of which heaven and earth were filled 
with his praise, to comfort the people. Now he begins 
to plead against the king of Babylon. 


V. 14. You would curse his scepter with the head of 
his spots, which come like a weather to scatter me, and 
rejoice as they devour the wretch in hiding. 

024 That is, to the kingdom of Babylon thou 
wouldest not be favorable, but unkind, "with the head 
of its spots,” that is, to the city of Babylon, which is 
the head of all its cities. Other kings and nations have 
also afflicted us, but they have left us in the land, but 
the Babylonians come like a storm and scatter us out 
of the land, and they are not satisfied with us, but they 
mock us and rejoice in our misfortune, "as if they 
were eating the wretch secretly,” that is, as if there 
were no judge, and he should remain unsmeared. 
For this is what he means by "eating secretly," when 
they think that God does not see it, or does not 
consider it wrong, so that no cry nor justice will go 
over it. 


V. 15. Your horses walk in the sea, in the mud of 
great waters. 


(25) That is, our traveling band and our army, 
which before had had a goodly salvation and victory, 
went everywhere with violence, as if it flew in the air, 
when thou didst help us; but now thou trustest us, "it 
walketh in the mire and deep waters," that is, in 
misery and distress, and canst no more. 


V. 16: Because | hear these things, my belly is 
troubled, my lips tremble with the cry. 

26Thatis, | eat not now, neither drink, that my belly 
may be merry, but fast, and mourn; neither sing I, as 
it were. 


gives at the merry time, when one eats, drinks and 
sings, but my lips tremble, for laughter and singing, 
that | hear such wailing. 


Pus goes into my bones. 

027 That is, my marrow and legs faint. For these 
are all Hebrew ways of saying that a merry heart 
makes the legs fat, a sorrowful or envious heart 
makes the legs fester, and so much is said: Merry 
courage is half the body, sorrowful courage also 
makes the legs weak; as all this experience gives, as 
follows: 


For | am grieved with myself. 
That is how | said, my sorrow makes such in my 
belly, lips and legs. 


O that | might rest in the time of trouble, when we 
go up to the people who dispute with us. 

29, That is, | would | were dead, and rested in the 
grave, because that | should hear the affliction, that 
we must go out of the land into the land of our 
enemies, which lead us away with strife. For it will be 
evil in the land, as follows: 


V. 17 For the fig tree shall not flourish, neither shall 
there be any increase in the vine; the work of the olive 
tree shall be wanting, and the fields shall yield no food, 
and sheep shall be plucked out of the folds, and there 
shall be no oxen in the stalls. 

(30) That is, because the people are carried away, 
the land is desolate, and there is no right cultivation 
nor cattle breeding, and everything is miserable; as 
Isaiah chap. 5:5 ff. also says, the land should become 
cheap, because so few people should remain in it. As 
Moses also writes in the third book [Cap. 26, 34], that 
the land should have its Sabbath, when they would 
be driven out of it. 1) 


V. 18. But | will rejoice in the Lord, and be glad in 
God my salvation. 

(31) This is my comfort in all such distress and 
anguish, that God will yet help us again. For the 
visions of the prophets are not yet ended, Christ will 
still come; let us then be glad again.

V. 19 For the LORD is my strength, and will make 

my feet like hinds' feet, and will lead me on high, 
singing on my strings. 
The verse is taken from the Psalter, because David 
also says Ps. 18:34: "The Lord makes my feet like 
hinds' feet, and leads me on high. All this is said: The 
Lord is still my God, and all my strength. We shall 
rejoice in this, that we shall lope and leap like hinds. 
So light shall our feet become, and shall no more 
wade and crawl in the mud, but shall wholly rejoice in 
soaring and flying on high, doing nothing but 


to sing joyfully, to play and to do all kinds of joyful 
work. This is to happen when the Babylonian scepter 
is cursed and disturbed, but we are redeemed, and 
Christ will come with his kingdom, amen. 

This is Habakuk's prayer and song, made for the 
comfort of the Jews, but with very broken words, 
which are unusual for us Germans. But we must get 
used to the Hebrew poems. For if they should hear 
our songs, it should sound as strange to them as their 
songs sound to us. But | hope that the prophet's 
opinion is correct; praise and thanks be to God 
forever. Amen.

Habakkuk beheld]. 

"The Prophet." Apparently a hopeful title. For apart 
from this, almost no other prophet calls himself a 
prophet. 


V. 2. How long shall | cry for iniquity? 
(vim patiens) ? 

As if he wanted to say: | do not cease to call, to 
preach and to reveal their godlessness to the people. 
| admonish the people against violence and injustice, 
but | do everything in vain, nothing happens less than 
that they should listen to me. This seems to me 1) to 
be the opinion, because Jerome and those who 
followed him think that this must be referred to the 
king of the Chaldeans, which does not have my 
approval. Whoever wants to, may follow Jerome, | do 
not follow him. For this is absolutely the rule 
(canonicum), which | also reminded above several 
times, that God, when he wants to punish the godless 
people, sends his prophets before the plague, who 
proclaim the word, reveal the sin and indicate the 
future wrath of God because of the sins, if perhaps 
there are some who convert. Moreover, | am also 
moved by the circumstances of the text that | cannot 
subscribe to Jerome's opinion, which | will indicate in 
its place later, where the passages occur. 


V. 3. Why do you let me see toil and labor? 

The holy scripture often uses these two words, 
which it also almost always tends to connect. But the 
Latin interpreter, who delights in an_ ill-applied 
abundance of words, has almost everywhere 
rendered them differently, while in Hebrew the same 
words are there. So it is also said in the 90th Psalm, 
v. 10: "Thus it has been toil and labor." The same is 
said elsewhere [Ps. 55, 10. 11.]: 


1) Instead of még, midi will be read. 





"Under their tongue is toil and labor." The same 
words are here; the meaning is, What is it that thou 
hast sent me to preach? | accomplish nothing, they 
do not repent, and so | must see only misery and 
misfortune, since | preach in vain, since they persist 
so blinded in their sense; "| see nothing but misery 
and misfortune". 


why do you show me robbery and iniquity around 
me: 

This | understand from the injustice of the people, 
as | have said, to whom | refer all this, not to the king 
of the Chaldeans. What now follows from this place, 
up to the place where he says: "Violence goes over 
right", is to be erased, since it does not stand in the 
Hebrew; perhaps it is added by a clever one. 2) 
Therefore, we read what is written in the Hebrew text 
(codicibus). 


Force prevails over law. 

As if he wanted to say: No matter is judged and 
spoken about according to the laws, no matter is 
heard, no matter is discussed, but they rule and 
abuse all laws and courts that are powerful according 
to their will. Through quarrels and disputes they hold 
up the court; there is not equal justice for all; even 
everything is violent and tyrannical, as he adds: 


: V. 4: Therefore, it is done differently than it should 
é. 

That is, the laws do not take place, there are no 
people who adhere to the laws, there are none who 
speak equal law, but the tyrants make laws 
according to their arbitrariness, and repeal them 
again. 


And cannot win any right thing. 

He speaks according to the Hebrew way [Vulg.: 
"Therefore judgment does not come to an end", as 
also in the Psalm is a similar way of speaking, the

here with the note: These four verses are not here in Hebrew. - In our 
Vulgate this addition is not.

1511 





means, no one carries out what is established by the 
laws. All this cannot be understood by the king of the 
Chaldeans. For what do the weapons have to do with 
the laws? The laws must be silent under arms, as he 
said: And by force the cause is carried on; the terrible 
warrior is loved, with the sword they claim their right 2c. 


For the wicked overpowers the righteous. 


(Instead of praevalet in the Vulgate) the Hebrew verb 
should more correctly be translated thus: For the wicked 
overpowers the righteous 2c. For it actually means to 
surround, to go around, to catch, as it is also in the 22nd 
Psalm, v. 13: "Great bullocks have surrounded me, fat 
oxen have surrounded me." Here he gives the reason 
why wrong judgments go, and the law does not stand 
right or waver (as is actually read according to the 
Hebrew); for, he says, the tyrants act with violence, they 
do not keep to the law, they oppress the righteous, 
therefore the judgments cannot be other than wrong and 
abominable. Justice is not pronounced rightly, but the 
tyrants make their pronouncements as they please. 
Therefore they err, just as someone on the wrong track 
is wont to err, as is also to be read according to the 
Hebrew. Namely, everything that follows is quite 
appropriately related to our view. It is impossible for this 
to happen with Jerome's opinion. But this can be seen 
not only in this passage of Jerome, but everywhere in all 
prophets, yes, almost in every single chapter of each. 
Since they (Jerome and his successors) twist them in 
their own way, | do not know how, it happens that they 
treat everything fragmentarily and the preceding is in no 
way connected with the following, and again. 


V. 5 Look among the Gentiles, behold and be 
amazed. 


Lucas has quoted this passage in the Acts of the 
Apostles Cap. 13, 41. according to the Septuagint 
translation, because he adds many words that are not in 
the Hebrew. And what is read here: "Look among the 


Gentiles," he translated, "Behold, ye despisers." This 
error could easily be produced in Hebrew by a single 
letter, and perhaps it happened by a mistake of the 
scribes that a letter was changed. But because 
nowadays all Bibles agree, so we also read, "Among the 
Gentiles." Perhaps it was also badly translated by the 
seventy interpreters, in whose translation, as they were 
negligent and careless, there are also many other 
errors, which must necessarily happen where there is 
not a careful and attentive interpreter. Next, what we 
read: Admiramini et obstupescite, is in Hebrew only 
one word, but twice shredded: "Be astonished, be 
astonished!" For this is the nature of the Hebrew 
language, that it often repeats the same expression, 
either for the sake of emphasis or distributionis, as: 
rejoicing | will rejoice, rejoicing | will be glad 2c., that is, 
| will rejoice greatly. And Moses used to repeat 
distributive (distri- butive), as he says: take the man and 
the man, that is, the individual men. The same (figure of 
speech of) distribution is also in this place. 


For | will do something in your days 2c. 
(Quia opius factum est in diebus vestris etc.). 


Here is what 1) moves me, why | think that this 
prophet prophesied before the time of the Babylonian 
captivity, because he speaks clearly about the king of 
the Chaldeans, who will come 2c. And the opinion is: 
Your sins have the upper hand, my preaching you 
despise, | produce no fruit among you, therefore look 
among all the Gentiles around, be amazed! A new thing 
will happen, the vengeance will not be postponed, the 
greatest misfortune threatens you. But you do not 
believe this, since it is now

is said. Thus, this saying applies in general to all 
unbelievers who do not believe until they fall into 
misfortune; they despise all threats as well as the 
promises of God. And so the question that could be 
raised here can be answered: why did Lucas cite this 
passage about Christ and the grace of Christ, while 
the prophet from whom he quoted had something 
quite different in mind, namely the king of the 
Chaldeans, of whom he threatens that he will come 
upon them. For how does Christ agree with the 
Chaldeans? It is to be wondered at how Jerome did 
not consider this question, who is otherwise in the 
discussion of such questions extraordinarily 
tormented, what one can see enough, if nowhere 
else, but in the epistle of Paul to the Galatians. Now 
| answer thus: that Christ and the apostles have this 
way, that they put on certain general sayings, which 
serve not only for the purpose (propositum) 
undertaken, but also in many similar things. Such is 
the saying, One blind man leads another [Luc. 6:39]; 
likewise [Luc. 14:11], "He that exalteth himself shall 
be humbled." This saying teaches humility 

and Christ referred it to the guests of 
hope, as the Gospel story teaches. Namely, all the 
works of God are such that the understanding of the 
flesh does not believe them at all, does not 
understand anything about them at all; they are 
higher than all understanding of reason, but this is to 
our great misfortune 2c. 


V. 6 For behold, | will raise up the Chaldeans, a 
bitter and quick people. 

Thus, the Lord is all in all. Without his will, nothing 
happens; it is he who awakens both the good and the 
bad to avenge himself.

It indicates the immense quantity and power of the

which announced the future destruction. And this 
they did by scriptures and promises of the Scriptures, 
which were given by God to this people, namely the 
Lord would not leave his people, to whom he had 
promised that he would be in their midst. Likewise, 
because he had promised them an everlasting 
kingdom, it would not happen that they would be led 
away into captivity, 2c., which | have reminded above 
almost in all other prophets. 


V. 7. 1) The one who gives and forces as he wills (Ex 
ipsa judicium ejus et onus ejus). 

That is, you have neglected judgment, you have 
perverted the law according to your arbitrariness, you 
have not given equal justice, but have done 
everything by force. Because you have therefore not 
wanted to judge rightly, therefore the judge will finally 
come upon you, who will teach you to judge: from him 
will proceed justice and compulsion (onus); because 
you do not follow justice, therefore the judgment and 
compulsion of the Chaldeans will occur; so that, as it 
were, it is said mockingly: if you do not want to judge, 
then he will judge. 


V. 8 Their horses are swifter than the horses of the 
parade; they are also more biting than the wolves of 
the evening. 

| know that | have read this of the wolves in the 
evening, as translated by our interpreter (lupis 
vespertinis), in two places in Scripture: in Zephaniah 
[Cap. 3, 3.] and in this prophet. But it is an ambiguous 
word, and there is dispute among grammarians as to 
whether it should be translated: Evening wolves or: 
wolves of the desert. Jerome has replaced it with 
evening wolves, namely, for this reason, because the 
hungry wolves in the evening, having suffered hunger 
all day, rage more among the herd into which they fall 
than others, and do not go away, because they are 
satiated. Who does not see that this is cold? 
Therefore | will rather accept the other opinion, that | 
translate: Wolves of the desert, that is, wild and not 
tamed. For so also the Germans use to say: "That the 
wild wolves

tear!" And Christ calls the wolves "ravening" [Matth. 
7, 15.]. So he indicates the heat and the impetuosity 
of the Chaldeans. 


Their riders move along with large piles from afar. 


Here is the same word diffundentur == XXXX,! ) - 
which also Moses [8rd book, 13, 5.] is wont to make 
frequent use of when describing the leprosy which 
has spread on the skin of a man. 


V. 9: They all come to harm. 


The prophet remains with the description of the 
power and the troops of the Chaldeans, namely they 
would come so armed and equipped that nobody 
could escape them. But | translate after the Hebrew 
thus: All will come to violence against their face, like 
the east wind. As if he wanted to say: No one can 
hope to resist the Chaldean, because he comes with 
violence like the wind; he will exercise violence and 
steal everything. And he compares him to the east 
wind. It does not only indicate that the Chaldeans 
have their residence in the east, but also their power 
and violence, as that wind is a violent one. Moses 
calls it everywhere in the Vulgate 2 Mos. 10, 13.] a 
burning wind, as can be seen in the second book of 
Moses. For it tends to dry up, just as the south wind 
tends to be rainy, as the Latin poets also call it 
Pluvius. 


Where they want to go, they will tear through like an 
east wind; and will gather prisoners like sand. 

Just as no one can hold back the wind from 
rushing through, so the Chaldean will rush in with 
such great troops and forces that you will not be able 
to resist, that he will gather all the people together as 
the wind gathers the sand of the sea. Thus he 
describes the innumerable and infinite multitude of 
the captives. 


1) In this remark, [proudly step in] is confused with XXX [sjch 
spread out]. 





V. 10. They will mock the kings. 
That is, not only the Jews, but also any kings he 
will lead away captive and display them in triumph. 


And of the princes they will laugh. 
That is, his power will be so great that he will easily 
overcome all, and he will laugh at those who try to 
resist him. 


All fortresses will be a joke to them. 


No city will be so fortified that he should not 
destroy it with easy effort. 


For they will make rubble and yet win. 

Jerome writes that Nebuchadnezzar made Tyre a 
peninsula, which before was a complete island. This 
has certainly made him great work, required 
extremely large crews and caused costs. However it 
may be, it is already quite certain from Ezekiel that 
he fought very fiercely against Tyre, as can be seen 
from the 26. 2) chapter of Ezekiel. For it was a very 
strong and rich city, so that it is also called "the 
strong" in Joshua [Cap. 19, 29]. And the prophet 
seems to allude to this here as well. 


V. ii. Then they will take a new courage, will 
continue and sin (Tunc mutabitur spiritus et pertransibit), 

This passage is dark [in the Vulgate translation]. | 
translate the same after the Hebrew thus: Then his 
heart will rise and go on and sin. This is how it tends 
to happen in human affairs. The human heart is too 
weak to make humble use of the good. It cannot be 
other than unruly, for well-being overpowers even the 
heart of the wise, as all the histories of all pagans and 
the exceedingly fine poems of the poets show: 
Luxuriant animi rebus plerumque secundis [The 
hearts are mostly luxuriant in well-being]; likewise: 3)

1516 L. xxvil, 179-181. interpretation of Habakkuk (2.), Cap. I, 11. 12. 


Nescia mens hominum fati sortisque futurae, Et 
servare modum, rebus sublata secundis. 


(The human heart does not know its future fate and 
destiny, and does not know how to measure up, 
puffed up by happiness]. The Scripture also indicates 
this, since it says [Ezek. 28, 2.], "Your heart arises as 
a heart of GOD." This is seen in the Romans, the 
Persians, the Medes, and all very powerful empires. 
The prophet says the same here of the king of the 
Chaldeans, as if to say: in the progress of all things 
so great and exceedingly blessed, he will boast of his 
power, he will be defiant, he will not be able to make 
use of victory (which the prophet required above all 
things in the case of the king), but will attribute the 
attainment of victory to his idol. Therefore he will sin, 
as he adds here: 


Then their victory must be of their God. 

This is how the prophet distinguishes the idol of 
Nebuchadnezzar from the true God. An idol is a 
conceit of the true God, but nevertheless false, since 
we want to please him with our intentions and our 
works. The true God, however, is the one who wants 
to do us good. He does not demand our goods or our 
works, as | have abundantly said above in Nahum 
about idolatry. For all pagans, however godless they 
are, boast of the name of God and the service of God, 
but they err 2c. And so our opinion is an idol for us. 


V. 12. But you, O LORD, my God, my Holy One, who 
are from eternity. 

Also here the prophet speaks in his special way of 
speaking, by which he differs from the other 
prophets. But here he 1) contrasts two Gods, the true 
and the false God, as if he wanted to say: He 
attributes the victory to his God, while in the 
meantime he does not know you, the true God, my 
God, so that the emphasis and the force lies in the 
words "his God" and "my God". And so the prophet 
speaks in the person of the people. For it was to him

so to the meaning: Lord, why do you suffer that the 
godless enemy tramples on your people, who are far 
better than he, since he does not acknowledge you 
as the leader and the author of this victory of his. Are 
you not my God? Thus the Scriptures use to call God 
the God of Israel and the Holy One in Israel, as the 
prophet also calls Him here, that is, the One who is 
holy and sanctifies Israel. Therefore the opinion is: Of 
course you give salvation to the godless kings, 
although you are my God and my holy one, so that 
we can already see from this that there is neither 
salvation nor victory, except from heaven. For the 
LORD hath no pleasure in the strength of rust, nor in 
the legs of any man 2c. [Ps. 147, 10.) "Neither do 
grates help" [Ps. 33, 17.]. 


Let us not die. 


Above | said that in all prophets the same thing is 
to be seen, because all prophets envision that the 
people will still be saved, that the kingdom of Judah 
will last until the future Christ, as Jacob had 
promised, as it is written in the first book of Moses 
[Cap. 49, 10). But against these sayings of the 
prophets and against the promises of the eternal 
kingdom the captivity fought. For who could hope for 
an eternal kingdom, since all have been led away into 
captivity into very distant lands, and the tribes are 
perishing? Here the human reason could not believe 
GOtte. Therefore the prophets strengthen the people 
that they may not doubt that they shall be led back 
and remain unharmed even in the midst of captivity 
2c. Therefore, he also says here: In this you are our 
God and our Holy One, that even though we are 
afflicted, even though we are led away captive, yet 
we do not perish, but only for this reason you punish 
us, that you may show us our sin, not that you may 
destroy us, as he adds here: 


But let them, O Lord, be only a punishment to us, 
and let them, O our refuge, chasten us only. 
He calls the king of the Chaldeans a scourge of 


God, by which the Lord chastises them. So the 
scripture also calls in a suffering way (pas-.

1519 





sive) the kings whose service God has used in disturbing 
any kingdom, a rod or staff of the Lord. Thus, in Isaiah 
[Cap. 10, 5], He calls Assyria the rod of His wrath. But 
they themselves, who thus triumph through God, in that 
God drives them and works them, think, because they 
are godless, nothing less than that God works through 
them, but attribute the victory to their forces, their 
weapons, not knowing that they are not able to do more 
than the Lord allows them, but meanwhile crying out [Ps. 
137, 7.]: "Clean off, clean off, down to their ground!" 
Habakkuk says the same thing here, as if to say, 
"However much the king of the Chaldeans may think that 
he will destroy us completely, he will not be able to do 
anything. We are to be restored to our land from which 
he takes us away, as if we were to be exiles forever. For 
you have set him only for chastening and judgment; he 
himself would not be able to do anything by himself. Nor 
will he be able to hold us back in captivity, because you, 
our refuge, have set him only for punishment. For other 
than in you we cannot stand. But all these things are 
known only by faith. The flesh believeth or knoweth 
nothing of these things, as he said above [v. 5.], "No man 
shall believe it, when it shall be told of it. "2c. For in 
temptation it cannot but despair; it cannot see and 
perceive life in the midst of death, not glory in disgrace 
2c. Only faith can do that. 


V. 13. Your eyes are pure. 


All this is connected with the foregoing, as if to say, 
The Chaldean sacrifices to his God, whereas he should 
sacrifice to thee, since thou givest us over to him to be 
chastened. Why then, O Lord, do you suffer that that 
wicked man should so exalt himself that one who is twice 
worse should prevail against us, who far surpass him in 
righteousness? We would bear it with greater equanimity 
if any godly king came against us. Because thine eyes 
are pure, and because thou canst not suffer evil, "why 
then lookest thou to the despisers, and holdest thy 
peace, that the wicked devour him that is more pious 
than he?" Then follows: 





V. 14. 1) And let the people go like fish in the sea. 


That is, you deal with Nebuchadnezzar in such a way 
that you make all other people before him as if they were 
fish and worms, that is, wandering about without a guide, 
given up to robbery. For as the fish are devoured, so thou 
offerest all men to him to be devoured. 


V. 15: They do it all with the name. 


He now remains in the image of the catch of fish until 
the end of the chapter. "All", that is, all kings, all peoples, 
he draws with the Hamen. Thus he makes a comparison 
between the fishing and the robbing of the king, as if he 
wanted to say: First of all he catches the most powerful 
among the people, then, when the kings, princes and 
nobles of the people are taken away, all the others are 
caught as the common fish (vulgus piscium) are usually 
caught. 


V. 16. Therefore they sacrifice to their net. 


From this it is quite clear what | said just before about 
the idol, that the prophets call that another God in which 
someone trusts, as the prophet says in such clear words 
that the king of the Chaldeans sacrifices to his net, that 
is, to the army with which he captures all nations, and 
said above [v. 11.] that he will sacrifice to his God. 
Therefore someone has that in God's stead in which he 
trusts, as power, troops, works 2c. 


Because through them their part has become so fat 
and their food so complete (electus). 

That is, he does not attribute the attainment of victory 
to you, but to his army, to his forces. - "Completely", [that 
means fat and strong, that is, exceedingly powerful and 
rich kingdoms. 


V. 17. For this reason they are still casting their net. 


That is, attracted by the loveliness of the prey, he 
does not stop, but continues to rob and devour, he is 
insatiable. For the more he catches, the more he desires:

everything he wants to subdue, with these very great 
kingdoms he is not satisfied. For so great is the 
ungodliness of the human heart and the urge or 
desire to obtain something, that it will never be 
satisfied. 


can. It always desires to attain more and greater 
things, as Alexander was not satisfied with having 
subjugated the whole world, but still desired another 
world, and | don't know what else. 


The second chapter. 


In the previous chapter the prophet described the 
power and the exceedingly mighty troops of the king 
of the Chaldeans, and his coming over all nations 
and against all kingdoms, from which it is clear that 
we are right in thinking that this prophet was before 
the Babylonian captivity. In this second chapter he 
prophesies again against the Chaldeans, namely 
punishment and vengeance, because they had 
disturbed everything, especially Jerusalem and the 
holy land, which finally happened completely after 
they were led away into captivity. Therefore he lived 
before the captivity and in the captivity and after the 
Babylonian captivity. Or, to whom this is more 
pleasing, he described according to prophetic 
manner as past or as already present what was still 
future. But the heart of the prophet or his intention 
(and this is common to all prophets) is that he keeps 
the people in faith, that he strengthens them through 
manifold consolations and the declaration of the will 
of God regarding the promises that had been made 
by God, so that the so afflicted people would not fall 
into disbelief, but give God the honor that he is true: 
Let it come to pass that they will not perish, let it come 
to pass that they will remain in the land until the 
coming of Christ, as the prophecies testified. For the 
flesh cannot entrust itself to GOtte in the temptation, 
cannot believe GOtte that he is true and keeps his 
promises. Namely, the prophet here fights against 
this doubt of the flesh, and so he finally comes to the 
main point in this matter, namely, that he strengthens 
and sustains the weak in faith. For as he describes 
above the battle of the army of the Chaldeans against 
the kingdoms and all the 





In the same way that he has described the struggle 
of the nations, here he describes his own struggle 
and conflict against those who were troubled by the 
temptation of despair, since they, bowed down by 
misfortune, could not believe that God would 
preserve his people and thought that it was all over 
for them and the whole kingdom because of the 
imminent miserable captivity, rather, because all had 
already been led away into captivity. But he begins 
the consolation with a parable, which is taken from a 
good and valiant watchman, who carefully observes 
and keeps off the approaching enemies on the 
lookout 2c. This seems to me to be the opinion of this 
chapter, otherwise, if we did not understand it in this 
way, we would not be able to understand ourselves 
from this passage, just as Jerome and all other 
writers have not been able to do so. For what they 
have brought up about this passage is absolutely 
nothing, lacks all sound judgment and is 
inappropriate. 


V. 1. Here | stand on my guard and tread on my 
feasts. 


He strengthens himself and raises his heart and 
mind in confidence against the people, who, 
frightened by the captivity, trembled and distrusted 
the promises of God, as if he wanted to say: However 
much you doubt, however much you may accuse me 
of lying, you will not convict me of it, but rather | will 
fearlessly persevere in the faith in the promises that 
have been made to us by God. 


And watch and see what am told. 


Namely from the Lord. That means: The Lord will 
say something to me. Through this. 


1522 xxvii, 186-188. Interpretations on the Prophets. 


what | hear, by this revelation of the Lord | will be 
instructed, that | may answer you who reproach me, 
as he says here: 


And what | should answer the one who scolds me. 


In this word the short epitome and the purpose of 
this whole chapter is shown. For he fights, as | have 
said, against the plots of the unbelievers, who thought 
that it had now happened to the kingdom, after the 
city had been set on fire, the kingdom disturbed, and 
they led away into captivity, and therefore they 
accused the prophets of lying, who promised that the 
kingdom would remain unharmed 2c. -Namely, he 
opposes these poisonous blasphemies, saying that 
he will stand as a faithful guardian, that he will see 
how the Lord is preserved, and that he will hear the 
Lord's counsel. 


V, 2. Write the face and draw it on a blackboard. 


This is a prophetic way, which is taken from the fifth 
book of Moses [Cap. 27, 4. 8.), where a command is 
given by smoothed and whitewashed stones, on 
which the renewed law (Deuteronomy) should be 
written clearly and distinctly. Moreover, God always 
confirmed the words of the prophets with hasty signs, 
or He always added a sign to the visions. Thus, when 
Isaiah foretold the destruction of Egypt, he confirmed 
his sermon by a sign, namely that he went forth naked 
and barefoot, Isa. 20:2. And thus he explained by a 
similar deed or sign the thing that he threatened 
Egypt with. So in the New Testament, baptism is 
given to us as a sign that the whole of the old Adam 
is to be put to death. For we are baptized into the 
death of Christ, as Paul says Rom. 6, 3. So there are 
many such signs; in Isaiah Cap. 8, 1. of the great 
letter, [v. 2.) of the witnesses 2c. Such is anch this 
sign in Habakkuk. He preaches that the vision of it, 
that the kingdom should be preserved, is certain and 
reliable. Therefore, he is commanded to write clearly 
and appropriately, so that it may be read by all without 
any stay. By this sign nothing else is indicated, than 





1523 


that what he promises will certainly come to pass. But 
he calls the vision in general a prophecy of Christ and 
the kingdom of Christ, which was already prophesied 
before in all prophets. And so he does not speak of 
the vision which he saw at that time, but of the vision 
of the prophets, that is, of the prophecy which is 
spoken of the future Christ, that he should present it 
on the tablet and present it most clearly and, as it 
were, point to it with his finger. That the word "vision" 
is to be taken in such a general way is clear from 
Daniel Cap. 9, 23: "Take heed therefore that thou 
understand the vision" 2c. Likewise, v. 24: "And the 
visions and the prophecies shall be sealed, and the 
holy of holies shall be anointed." In this passage he 
calls the vision the prophecy of the preservation of the 
Jewish people, which had already been prophesied, 
and of the future of Christ 2c., for besides Gabriel 
Daniel saw nothing else 2c. 


That it could be read by anyone who walks by. 

That is, make the writing exceedingly clear and 
distinct, so that the reader may not be hindered by the 
writing that is not clearly written, but that someone 
may be able to read it even as he passes by. Now he 
adds the face or the word: 


V. 3: The prophecy will be fulfilled in its time. 

Everything in this passage is poorly translated [in 
the Vulgate) from the Hebrew. [Instead of: Quia visus 
adhuc procul, et apparebit in finem) | translate thus: 
for the vision still takes place at the appointed time, 
or still more clearly: "in its time." That is, this vision, 
foretold by the prophets, has its certain and 
predetermined time; it will not deceive us, it will 
undoubtedly come to pass in its time what is foretold. 
Then follows: 


And will finally come free to day and not remain 
outside. 


For our [Latin] interpreter has translated badly [et 
apparebit). But it is 


1) In our original: Nese instead of: Oadriolsm, as should be 
read according to Dan. 9, 2 


1524 L- xxvn, 188-IW. Interpretation of Habakkuk (2.), 


Cap. 2, 3. 4. 1525 





the same word which the evangelist Lucas uses to 
translate by TrappnoidZelv [Apost. 

26, 26.]. So it is also in the 12th Psalm, v. 6.: 1) "I will 
make a pod, that one may teach with confidence." 
Likewise elsewhere in the Psalm: He will speak 
defiantly to his enemies. The evangelist John 
expresses this figure of speech almost everywhere 
like this [Joh. 16, 29.]: "Behold, now thou speakest 
freely" 2c. It is therefore the opinion of the prophet: 
One must await the end until that comes to pass 
which is promised by Christ. He had to use these 
excellent words and signs to strengthen the people, 
who were already despairing in the so great 
misfortune, which became more severe day by day. 


But whether it consumes, wait for it. 


With a great fullness of speech and power he 
comforts, so that what he had expressed shortly 
before in a negative way, he expresses here in an 
affirmative way, and answers, as it were, with an 
objection to those who could have objected to him: 
You promise us a Savior, you promise us an inviolate 
kingdom, but when will that finally come? The matter 
is always postponed. We see nothing less before us 
than that we and the kingdom will remain unharmed, 
since the kingdom will be devastated and we will be 
led away captive 2c. To these the prophet replies, 
"Wait," he says, "even if the face is distorted and 
does not come immediately; even if we do not see 
salvation coming immediately, we will see it at last; it 
will surely come and will not delay. Thus the prophet 
stands firm in his office and comforts the weak in 
faith, who were oppressed by the temptation of 
despair when the calamity became so heavy. And not 
only that, but he also chides his blasohemers, whom 
he in turn bites with accusations and accuses them 
of impiety, as he adds here: 


V. 4. See who is stiff-necked. 
This is also poorly translated sim Latin: Ecce, qui 
incredulus est | but over- 


1) In the text (according to the Vulgate) correctly: in psalmo 11. The 
Weimarsche has in the margin: Ps. 10, 5. which, according to the 
Hebrew, almost agrees with the passage that follows. 





set like this: But behold, where there is 
stubbornness, his soul will have no rest in it. That is, 
whoever resists or defends himself against this 
prophecy and, as it were, will not listen with clogged 
ears, whoever will stubbornly defend himself, he will 
find no rest for himself, he will not delight in this 
vision, he will gain no fruit from it 2c. Here the prophet 
acts, as | said, against the blasphemers, as if he 
wanted to say: Beware, you who neither move the 
public Scripture (pictura) nor the Word, since if 
someone resists this promise out of stubbornness, 
he will be in a bad situation: he will not have a part in 
this vision, he will not obtain fruit from it, which is 
promised to come at the time when it will be fulfilled. 
This is it, that he says: His soul shall have no rest in 
the same, that is, in the promise. This is what Christ 
says in other words in the gospel parable of the 
invited guests who refused to come, saying [Luc. 
14:24]: "None of the men who are invited will taste 
my supper" 2c. The author of the Epistle to the 
Hebrews has drawn on this passage in the 10th 2) 
chapter, v. 38. and translated it thus: "But whosoever 
shall depart, with him shall my soul have no 
pleasure." In this he followed the Septuagint 
translation, which translated it this way, but the 
Hebrew text (Hebraism) has it quite differently. For 
they have referred it to the soul of God, which does 
not fit. But although the author of the letter to the 
Hebrews has erred in the words, he has nevertheless 
quite appropriately and aptly obtained the right 
opinion of the prophet 2c. 


For the righteous lives by his faith. 


This passage has been magnificently treated by 
the apostle Paul in his letter to the Romans and in his 
letter to the Hebrews, as it is also worthy. As a 
conclusion and summa, the prophet added it to this 
opinion: The godly wait for the Lord, therefore they 
live, therefore they are preserved, therefore they 
receive what is promised, namely through faith, 
because they have received God. 


2) In our template: in vax. 11.

give the glory that he is true, because they endure 
the hand of the Lord. And so the prophet does not 
look at this promise alone, but at all the others that 
deal with the preaching of the gospel or the revelation 
of grace. Therefore it is as if he wanted to say: | 
cannot get it into your hearts; you have the public 
Scripture (picturam) and the Word. If ye believe, ye 
shall live: for the just man liveth by faith, waiting on 
the Lord, he liveth: if ye believe not, ye shall not live. 
2c. But this seems to be quite impossible according 
to the flesh, which cannot help but look at the present 
misfortune, at the present evil. Hence it is that it 
forgets the promises. For what seems to be less 
acceptable to the flesh than to see the most 
miserable captivity, to see the desolation of the 
kingdom, to see the inhabitants carried away, and yet 
to believe that the kingdom shall be preserved, that 
the people shall be unharmed in their land 2c. as the 
prophecies read. Thus, the prophecies seemed to be 
completely opposite, about which we have dealt 
above quite abundantly in the preface to Jonah and 
other prophets, where we read the passage from 
Jeremiah Cap. 32, 8, about the buying of the field. 
God's works and words are so wonderful that they 
are neither understood nor understood by the flesh.

can be believed, as the prophet also said above. Only 
faith knows and understands and believes this. So 
we also believe that we are to be restored to body 
and spirit, through Christ and with Christ, which is 
quite impossible for human nature to believe, which 
has not been born again through the Holy Spirit 2c. 

And this is the first and most important part of this 
prophet, in which he promises that Christ will come 
and that the promises made to the fathers will be 
fulfilled. Now follows the second part, in which he 
describes the destruction of the kingdom of the 
Chaldeans, however exceedingly powerful, rich and 
famous it was. And thus he prophesied two things 
impossible in the sight of the flesh: the one, that those 
who had been carried away into captivity, whose land 
had been laid waste by conflagration and robbery, 
should be brought back again and restored to their 
former kingdom 2c.; the other, that he who was so 
exceedingly mighty a king, who had subdued all 
kingdoms to himself, with whom was the dominion of 
the world, - | say, that he should be punished again, 
that his kingdoms should be laid waste and snatched 
away from him 2c. Namely, this is how he destroys 
all the reasons of the flesh, so that we may cling to 
the word of God with closed eyes, and give glory to 
God that he is true. 


[The third chapter. | *) 


Cap. 2, 5. But wine deceives the proud man. 


According to the Hebrew it is said: As wine makes 
someone bad or reprehensible, so will it be with the 
proud man. That is to say, as wine makes men 
become lavish, ungodly and impudent, as gluttons do 
who get drunk on wine, so will my Nebuchadnezzar, 
king of the Chaldeans, be with his own. 





who are already drunk with wine, that is, have 
overloaded themselves with exceedingly great 
goods and have filled their dens to the top; but what 
will happen to them is what is commonly said in the 
common saying: "A drunken house spits out the host 
again," as he recites here: 
That he cannot stay. 

[Instead of: Et non decorabitur] it should be much 

more correct name: therefore it will not

remain or non ornabitur. That is, they will not remain in 
their palaces, in this abundance of all things. With them 
the supremacy will no longer remain, but will be taken 
away from them, they will become lowly on earth 2c. 


Who unlocks his soul like hell. 


He gives the reason for the preceding and interprets 
the exceedingly great drunkenness of the king of the 
Chaldeans, namely his immense avarice and insatiable 
greed, as if to say: he could not get enough, he robbed, 
he robbed as long as he could, never could he rid himself 
of this greed. "His soul," that is, he has a mind 
(affectum) like hell, which cannot be satisfied, as it is 
said in the Proverbs of Solomon [Cap. 30, 16.]. A similar 
passage is also in Isaiah [Cap. 5, 14.]. 


. But gather to himself all the heathen. 


That is. The possessions of all peoples, the wealth 
and the very best kingdoms of the world. But this power 
of his will pass away, he will not be able to endure, since 
an all too great power falls by its own mass, as he said, 
and as one is in the habit of saying: No act of violence is 
long-lasting, as he soon adds here: 


V. 6. But what is the point? All these will make a 
saying of him. 

That is, they will seize a joke word or a mocking 
speech 1) or a proverb with which they will mock him, 
they will throw up proverbs against him and will quite 
brazenly and publicly poke fun at him, sparing nothing. 
Thus the prophet describes the very miserable and 
lamentable disturbance of the kingdom of the 
Chaldeans, as Ovid 2) says of destroyed Troy: Now the 
seed stands where Troy was, and must be cut off with 
the sickle 2c. Now he adds one of the proverbs:

1529 


Woe to him who increases his wealth with the wealth 
of others. 


That means: Badly won, badly lost. That which comes 
quickly, quickly passes away. "It will be to you as the 
grass is to the dog.” 


And only loads a lot of mud on itself. 


In Hebrew it is only One word, which our [Latin] 
interpreter translated by two [namely lutum densum], 
but it means "mud". He punishes the king's avarice. 
Since he does not cease to gather together many 
kingdoms, they will at last be a burden and ruin to him. 
For he compares them to mud and says that he will be 
weighed down by it. This is what he said in a fine and 
wise way: He whom many fear must necessarily fear 
many. Therefore, "to bring much mud upon oneself" is to 
rule in such a way that one must fear. Thus it happens, 
as Ennius said: They may hate, if they only fear. 3) The 
prophet indicates that all the kingdoms will revolt against 
the king, since he has obtained dominion by force. 


V.7. 0 how suddenly shall they awake that bite thee. 


He explains by a simile taken from a sleeping tyrant, 
who is fearful by nature, how heavy the mud will be. As 
if he wanted to say: You are now safe. Since things are 
still going well, you have confidence that you will remain 
in your kingdom and in your tyranny. But soon, since you 
do not think of it, those will rise against you who will bite 
you, namely those whom you now think are on your side. 
You will become a robber, they will rob you as you 
robbed them and made them tributary to you by force. 


V. 8.4) For the sake of men's blood, and for the sake 
of iniquity in the land and in the city. 


The prophet indicates in this the chief sin, namely, 
that he led away captive the people of God and laid 
waste Jerusalem, the city of God, in which was the word 
of God. For

1531 





He emphatically calls Jerusalem "the city", as if it was 
the only city on the whole earth where the word of 
God is. The king of the Chaldeans fought against this, 
and this was his first sin, which the prophet puts on 
him here. All this is said to comfort Judah, which the 
prophet wanted to strengthen so that it would not 
despair, but would believe that the kingdom would 
remain unharmed until Christ came. But, as | have 
said, he prophesied something incredible to both the 
Jews and the Chaldeans: salvation and _ the 
preservation of the kingdom to the former, and 
destruction and ruin to the latter, as indeed it came to 
pass. For Cyrus king of the Persians disturbed the 
whole kingdom of the Chaldeans 2c. 


V. 9 Woe to him who is stingy to the detriment of his 
house. 


He points to another sin, namely, the great avarice 
of the king and the princes, by which they made all 
the nations weak and helpless, by burdening them 
beyond measure, by imposing intolerable burdens on 
the subjects, so that they might build themselves very 
strong and beautiful castles in which they could dwell 
safely. 2c. He says of this avarice that it will bring 
misfortune to the house, as if he wanted to say: This 
avarice will finally be harmful and evil for your house. 


V. 10 But your counsel will be to the shame of your 
house. 


That is, all this will be to the shame of your house, 
all that you have feared will pass over your head. 


And you have sinned with all your might (Et peccavit 
anima tua), 

By the term anima [soul] the whole devotion is 
indicated, that is, the ardent and complete desire. 
Thus Moses says of Pharaoh [2 Mos. 15, 9.]: Et 
implebitur anima mea etc., that is, "I will cool my 
weary on them." The same way of speaking is here: 
With thy soul thou hast sinned, that is, out of pure 
wickedness thou hast sinned, "that thou shouldest 
cool thy little weal." And that this is the right opinion 
is proved by what follows: 





V. 11. For even the stones in the wall will cry out. 

A tyrant has so little courage that he is not safe 
anywhere. He does not trust anyone even among his 
own; he is also afraid of a flying leaf. He says exactly 
the same thing here, as if he wanted to say: You will 
fear so much for yourself that, when the lowering 
buildings crack, you will think that a misfortune is 
threatening you. Because he alludes to it, since he 
says of the screaming of the walls. For it will soon be 
remembered that all these buildings and riches were 
obtained by evil artifice, namely from the sweat of the 
poor, and so they will accuse your conscience that 
you have ungodly brought about your riches by 
violence and robbery. 2c. For this is what such men 
do when their conscience makes them guilty, that 
they think their sin is manifest to all creatures, as it is 
commonly said, "The world is too narrow for him." 
Likewise, "Methinks the walls look upon me." Thus 
the prophet spoke in a poetic manner. For poets are 
wont to describe thus: The happy seeds and the 
laughing meadows 2c. 


Woe to him who builds the city with blood. 

He describes the third sin, in which he declares 
the king and his kinsmen guilty not only of avarice, 
namely, that they collected and extorted taxes by 
force, but also that they accomplished many things by 
blood, that is, that they killed many innocent people, 
whose possessions and goods they then seized. 
They had oppressed many innocent people, against 
whom they had exercised unjust justice and had 
pronounced unjust judgments, so that they, by 
condemning many, might take property, as he says 
here: "You judge the city with injustice,” that is, with 
unjust judgment. 


V. 13. What the nations have worked for you must 
burn with fire. 

That means, for this your godlessness you will 
receive this reward: You will suffer this punishment 
from God, namely that Babylon and your whole 
kingdom will be set on fire, and thus everything will 
perish by conflagration. 


1532 xxvii, iW-i98. Interpretation of Habakkuk (2.), cap. 2, 13-16. 


1533 





will. Meanwhile, the inhabitants will struggle 
miserably to extinguish the flame, but will be unable 
to do so; they will be deceived in their efforts. 
Therefore, they will be tormented in two ways: that 
their goods and everything they have will be set on 
fire, then that they will be lacking in their great effort 
and endeavor, wanting to preserve theirs while they 
are unable to do so. 


V. 14 For the earth shall be filled with the 
knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters that 
cover the sea. 

A similar passage is in Isaiah [Cap. 11, 9.], where 
he describes the glory that shall be revealed through 
the gospel, namely, that it shall come to pass that 
throughout all the world, where the gospel is 
preached, there shall be abundant remission of sins 
2c. But here the prophet does not speak of the 
revelation of grace, but, as other prophets are wont 
to speak, of the knowledge of the Lord's vengeance 
on the wicked, which he visited home, as [Num. 
14:21]: "As truly as | live, so shall all the earth be filled 
with the glory of the Lord." And as the Lord says to 
Pharaoh in the second book of Moses [Cap. 9, 16.]: 
"Therefore have | raised thee up, that my power may 
appear in thee, and that my name may be declared 
in all lands." The prophet says the same thing here, 
as if to say: Just as the Lord was glorified by killing 
the godless Pharaoh and others against whom he 
proceeded with punishment, so he will cause, after 
Babylon is destroyed, all nations to glorify him, to give 
thanks to him, and to ascribe to him the attainment of 
victory. 


V. 15 Woe to you who pour out your neighbor's 

drink and mix in your anger and make him drunk so 
that you see his shame. 
The fables of the Jews, which they bring up about this 
passage, are null and void: the king of the Chaldeans 
gave Hezekiah a potion to make a covenant with him, 
and | do not know what else, as the Jews are 
extraordinary artists in making their things great. But 
it is a figure of speech that is common in Scripture. 
For by 





the cup and the drink the Scripture denotes wrath and 
vengeance, as it is said in the Psalm [Ps. 11, 6. 
Vulg.]: "A weather (spiritus procellarum) is the theil of 
their cup." Very frequently Jeremiah and Isaiah used 
this idiom. "To drink the cup" therefore means to 
suffer misfortune and punishment; but "to give to 
drink" to inflict punishment, to afflict someone. He 
therefore speaks of the excessive cruelty and tyranny 
of the king, namely, that he had exercised excessive 
tyranny against those whom he had conquered in 
war, had afflicted them more than the Lord wanted 
them afflicted, as he said above in the first chapter, 
v. 12: "Let them be to us, O Lord, only a punishment; 
let them, O our guardian, only chasten us. "2c. The 
HErr was intent only on chastening, not that he would 
destroy, but the king was intent on disturbing. And 
this is what he calls here: "to mix in the wrath". 


That you see his shame. 


This image is taken from a drunkard who lies bare, 
exposed to the eyes of all, like Noah. It is therefore 
the opinion: All wealth, all power, all goods you have 
taken from them, so that nothing else is left to them 
but shame and the highest poverty 2c. 


V. 16: You also drink so that you stagger (et 


circumcidere). 


For so it is to be read according to the Hebrew, 
and the opinion is, | will make thee drunken again, 
that thou shalt lie bare and shameful, so that as a 
drunken man all the heathen shall utterly cut thee 
down, that is, that, being thus afflicted and cast down, 
they shall plunder thee again, and rob thee of all that 
is thine. 


For you will be surrounded by the cup in the right 
hand of the Lord. 


That means your misfortune will be very great. 


And must spit shamefully for your glory. 


Alnstead of vomitus ignominiae] in Hebrew is only 
One word, which our “Latin” interpreter translated by 
two. But | confess that | do not know what the Hebrew

1535 





word actually means. Therefore, for the time being, | 
follow the interpretation of our interpreter, that it 
means: a shameful spitting, a shameful and not a 
respectable one. Therefore the opinion is: Just as 
someone who spits shows that he has drunk too 
much or eaten too much, so all will bear witness of 
you that you are already deprived of all your glory, all 
goods and all honor, while you were both exceedingly 
rich and exceedingly glorious until now, namely, you 
had eaten so much. 2c. 


V. 17 For the iniquity committed in Lebanon shall 
overtake thee. 


He says that the most prominent cause of the 
disturbance of the kingdom of the Chaldeans was 
that they had set themselves against Judah, the 
people of God, and raged terribly against Jerusalem, 
against the city of God, where the Word of God 
reigned. For this is how Satan uses his powers most 
where he sees the Word of God reigning. But he calls 
Judea "Lebanon" according to the way of the 
Scriptures, because in distant lands Judea was 
called after the name of famous mountains or rivers, 
as can be seen from the Psalm [Ps. 42, 7.]: "I 
remember you in the land by the Jordan. "2c. - 


And the disturbed animals will frighten you. 


That is, you laid waste the land, you carried away 
all the cattle. According to your will you have 
exercised tyranny against the people you have 
conquered. The same will happen to you 2c. 


V. 18. What then will help the image that his Master 
has formed? 


So far we have seen prophetic threats against the 
kingdom of the Chaldeans. At last he adds here a 
kind of mockery, imitating in it Moses, who similarly 
mocked the idolatrous children of Israel, who had 
departed from the true God and the service of the 
true God, saying [Deut. 32:37.], "Where are now thy 
gods?" 2c. According to this example, the prophet 
here also mocks the king and the kingdom of the 
Chaldeans, as if to say: Behold, | have given you the 





You will be disturbed, you will lose the kingdom, 
yours will be taken away captive, because all your 
sins deserve this. But now may your gods help you, 
whom you worship and adore as true gods. Call upon 
them, now may they deliver thee from this ruin 2c. But 
how will they be able to help you, since they are mute 
images, stones that cannot speak? With great 
emphasis he calls their idols "dumb idols" and stones 
that cannot speak, as if he wanted to say: Now finally 
you realize that your idols are not true gods, since 
they, where your affairs are extremely desperate, 
cannot help you where they should help the most. So 
the Jews also mocked the other nations, as it is 
written in the Psalm [Ps. 115:3-6]: "Their idols are 
silver and gold, made by the hands of men. They 
have mouths and do not speak; they have eyes and 
do not see; they have ears and do not hear. "2c. [V. 
3.:] "But our GOD is in heaven, He can create 
whatever He wills." Thus the prophet also adds a 
comparison here; for he compares the true GOtt with 
the idols of the heathen. 


V. 20. The Lord is in his holy temple. Let all the 
earth be silent before him. 


That is, our God lives in such a way that even all 
the world trembles and is silent before him. That is, it 
falls silent, it does not even dare to murmur before 
him, as it also says in Isaiah [Cap. 41, I.]: "Let the 
islands be silent before me" 2c. This is indeed a short 
word, but, short as it is, it nevertheless comprehends 
very great things in itself. For it embraces both 
testaments, the old and the new. The face of the Lord 
in Scripture means the knowledge or future of the 
Lord when He is made known and revealed to us. 
Therefore, before the revelation of the Gospel, God 
is known throughout the world, but much more is He 
known after the revelation of the Gospel. Gospel. And 
before this knowledge of God, every man lays down 
his hope (ponit cristam), so that no one has anything 
to boast of except the Lord 2c. This is what the 
prophet calls here: that all the world is silent before 
the face of the Lord.

the commentators. For almost every single interpreter 
has invented such a different opinion that to this day 
everyone is uncertain from their writings what the 
prophet had in mind in this prayer of his. For as 
hitherto, so even to this day, the writers of Scripture 
disagree [about the interpretation of the text] in both 
languages, Greek and Hebrew. Jerome has often 
been quite ugly, not only in his opinion and in his 
evaluation of the prophet's intention, but also in his 
grammar, so much so that sometimes even someone 
who understands Hebrew only to some extent can 
recognize Jerome's error with complete certainty. | 
wonder very much why the dear God has allowed 
such excellent and excellently learned men to have 
erred in such a childish way. Then they treat the 
Proverbs as if they were individual chunks, 
interpreting one passage from the king of the Persians

not know at all, as if it did not concern me. And this is 
what the whole seventh Psalm has in mind when it 
says [v. 4]:. "O Lord, my God, | have done these 
things, and there is iniquity in my hands," 2c., as if to 
say, "A guilt is laid upon me of which | am not at all 
aware. They accuse me of impiety, while | am 
innocent in this matter 2c. Therefore, the prophet 
prays for the unconscious things (ignorantiis), that is, 
for himself and the rest of the godly who are 
innocently imprisoned, that the Lord may bring them 
back, since their conscience is not aware of the sin 
for which the others deserved imprisonment. And so 
he laments that the guilty and the innocent are 
equally afflicted, as is wont to happen in wars. So 
also Jeremiah was led away into captivity with many 
other godly people. This seems to me to be the

1538 L. XXVII, 202-208. Interpretations on the prophets. 


1539 





The prophet David speaks of his cause, of his tribulation, 
and soon turns to the history of the expulsion from Egypt, 
saying [v. 8]: "The earth quaked and was moved, and 
the foundations of the mountains were stirred" 2c. 
Similarly, in the 68th Psalm, when he wants to tell how 
Christ will rise and go to heaven, of the grace that will be 
revealed through the gospel, he goes far and tells the 
earlier stories by which he makes his way, as, of the 
miracles performed by the hand of the Lord to the 
Israelites, when he brought them out of Egypt, when he 
duked before them, when he led them, when he gave 
them food from heaven 2c. For this is the way of the 
Hebrew language, that they [the prophets] praise this 
history of the bringing out of Egypt as the head of all the 
other histories, and frequently mention it, and go on very 
far, and add to it the other histories. The prophet 
Habakkuk does quite the same thing here; since he asks 
for salvation, he first inserts this miraculous work of God 
and has woven it for himself, as it were, as a kind of 
curtain on which he lists the various deeds and miracles 
of God, just as if someone were to present a painted 
panel depicting Christ's suffering and, as it were, set it 
before his eyes. And through all these miracles of God 
he strengthens himself 2c. It is therefore the opinion, "O 
Lord, | have heard thy rumor," that is, of all thy miracles, 
of the works of thy goodness which thou hast done to thy 
people, by which thou hast shown thine extraordinary 
goodness. So it is also said in the Psalm [Ps. 44, 2.]: 
"God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told 
it to us" 2c. 


That | am horrified. 


That is, when | was frightened by the greatness of 
these miracles of yours, a great awe seized me, because 
| became aware of your great goodness and majesty. 
Thus, spiritual people are struck with terror and awe 
when they hear such wonderful works of God and 
examples of divine goodness, since they consider the 
matter a little further by thinking about it. Others, 
however, who only read about it, are not moved by this 
reverence and fear. 


O Lord, you make your work come alive in the midst 
of the years. 

The word illud, which the Latin interpreter added, is 
superfluous, because the Hebrew way of speaking is 
very often that the relative is prefixed, as it is said in the 
1st Psalm, v. 4: Like chaff, which the wind scatters 2c. 
In my opinion, however, it is as if he wanted to say: Lord, 
do what you are used to doing. But you used to do so, 
that you made your work alive with the years and made 
it known, and were mindful of your mercy in wrath. But 
all interpreters have struggled extraordinarily with what 
the prophet calls the middle of the years. With large 
agreement they want that this is spoken of the donkey 
and the ox, in whose middle the Christ child in the 
manger lay, as the fable is used to be told. Who does 
not see how inconsistent this opinion is, and does not 
hold true in this place? | translate first after the Hebrew 
thus: Lord, make your work alive within the years, as if 
he wanted to say: Your work, which | ask now, do not 
postpone within the years. Help us, deliver us from 
captivity, since the time of captivity seems too long to us. 
Therefore, O Lord, make your work endure, make it live, 
fulfill what the other prophets have promised. For to us 
the delay seems too long 2c. Thus he uses very fervent 
words, as those are wont to use such words who suffer 
evil, who are in the greatest danger. And when they 
already think that it is all over for them, when there is 
despair everywhere and no hope to escape, then the 
Lord is there and helps them. And so the Lord is there 
"in the midst of the years," that is, a helper in the midst 
of great troubles [Ps. 46:2, 138:7], and at the right time, 
as it is said in the Psalm [Ps. 9:10, Vulg.]. So also Job 
says [Cap. 11, 17. Vulg.]: "And when thou thinkest thou 
art gone, thou shalt arise as the morning star." All this is 
perfectly illustrated by the exodus of the children of 
Israel from Egypt through the sea, when Pharaoh 
harassed them and pursued them with his whole army, 
but they escaped safely through the sea, thinking that it 
was all over for them.

happened. In the desert the rock gave them water, 
the food came from heaven 2c. The same is what is 
added: 


And let it be known in the midst of the years. 


This means: Lord, show yourself at last; there are 
many years, the captivity is hard for us, finally break 
the delay and the lukewarm duration, cut off the long 
duration or the delay, show yourself that you are our 
God, deliver us, "dear Lord, strike three" 2c. 


When there is tribulation, remember mercy. 


According to the Hebrew, | translate thus: in 
perturbatione recorderis misericordiae [instead of: 
cum iratus fueris, misericordiae recordaberis in the 
Vulgate]. He speaks of perturbation (perturbatione), 
not with which God is perturbed, but by which we are 
perturbed. Bernhard treats this passage well, but 
what he brings up is not said in the right place, it does 
not serve the purpose of what is being discussed 
here. But the Hebrew word which we have translated 
here by perturbatio is also in the 4th Psalm, v. 5, 
where it says, "If ye be angry, sin not," that is, do not 
be agitated, do not be so impatient that ye sin, that 
ye give place to wrath 2c. It is therefore the opinion 
of the prophet: O Lord, may you remember mercy in 
our trouble or in our affliction, so that we may not be 
overcome by trouble, as he says in Psalm [Ps. 85:9], 
"Oh, that | should hear the words of God the Lord" 
2c., "lest the saints fall into foolishness,” that is, lest 
they finally grumble against God, overcome by the 
longsuffering of temptation. Thus the Lord is there in 
His place and in His time, as the apostle says in the 
Epistle to the Corinthians [1 Cor. 10:13]: "God is 
faithful, who does not let us be tempted beyond our 
ability, but makes the temptation come to an end so 
that we can bear it." 


V. 3. God came from the midday. 


As | said above that this was the way of the prophets 
and other saints in Scripture, that when they prayed, 
they immediately prayed in 





the first verses present their cause and then digress 
into a long prayer of praise to God, which they take 
from all the miracles and works of God, the prophet 
does quite the same here. For now he presents, as it 
were, a curtain on which all this is woven, which he 
preaches about God, as | have said. Therefore, one 
must imagine here nothing but person poetry, and 
the words which [in the Vulgate] are in the future 
tense are to be read in the indicative prasentis. Then 
it will be more easily understood, not unlike someone 
pointing his finger at the history of the Passion of 
Christ painted on the wall, if he told everything in the 
right order. This is also how the prophet is to be 
understood here, since he comes to the narration of 
the miracles of God. First of all, he also remembers 
the Exodus from Egypt, as the main piece of all the 
miracles of God known to the people of Israel. Egypt 
lies in the southern direction, therefore he says: the 
Lord came from the south. 


And the saint from the mountain Paran. 


"Paran" is the proper name of the desert, which 
was near the tribe of Judah, where the Israelites 
stayed for a long time 2c., as the sacred history [4 
Mos. 13, 1.] says. It is called in the Scriptures [4 Mos. 
32, 8.] also with another name KadesBarnea. 


Heaven was full of his praise. 


Many psalms are full of it. [Ps. 148, 13: "His praise 
goes forth as far as the heavens and the earth." 
Likewise [Ps. 8, 1. Vulg.]: "For thy glory is higher than 
the heavens." The prophet says the same thing here, 
as if to say: "Throughout the world his name, his 
honor and glory were praised by the wonderful work 
of bringing out of Egypt the people whom he had 
chosen for himself. And that this is the right 
conception is indicated by what follows: 


And to his glory the earth was full. 


Thus Rahab says, Jos. 2, 9. ff.: "I know that the 
Lord has given you the land, for a terror has fallen 
upon us before you, and all the inhabitants of the land 
have become cowards before your future. For we 
have heard. 


1542 L. XXVII, 207-2M. Interpretations about the prophets. ; 


1543 





as the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea 
before you, when ye came forth out of Egypt” 2c. "For 
the LORD your GOD is one GOD, both in heaven 
above and on earth beneath." 


V. 4. Shem's splendor was a light. 


What our [Latin] interpreter has translated by 
splendor, one would translate more correctly by 
radius, "the shines", that is, his rays spread far. And 
itis the opinion: His manifestation and revelation, the 
price of his power is so spread and revealed that it is 
known far and wide; in short, everywhere in the world 
one praises his deeds. 


Shines went from his hands (Cornua in inanibus ejus). 


Cornua [horns] he takes here figuratively also for 
rays or for shine. For this is how the Scripture speaks 
of the face of Moses [Ex 34:29, Vulg]: "The face of 
Moses was horned," that is, it cast forth rays that 
shone like straight horns. Then, according to the 
Hebrew, it is to be read thus: Cornua de manu ejus, 
that is, according to the winnowing of the rays of light, 
the miracles spread from his hand. 


There secretly was his power. 

Namely, in this light, in this letting see, in this 
preaching and this glory of his miracles was his 
power, as if he said thus: He did not make known 
these his miracles, he did not let these his rays shine 
in other peoples, but in the midday and in Paran. 


Vv. 5. Pestilence went before him. 


Here a new section begins. For he presents a 
whole new painting, as he will enumerate many in 
turn, and that in great and prophetic abundance, as 
we shall see in turn. And here he presents a real 
painting, in which he describes, as in the others that 
follow, what he called the light and splendor of the 
Lord, namely his exceedingly glorious works and 
miracles, which were publicly made known to the 
Gentiles, especially to those who lived around. 


But the Hebrew word means both death and 
pestilence. | translate it here "pestilence". It means 
the plague with which the Lord struck the Egyptians, 
so that in one night all the firstborn died, both of men 
and cattle. Then what follows: 


And plague went out wherever he stepped. 


[Instead of: Egredietur diabolus ante pedes ejus in 
the Vulgate] | translate thus: Et exivit febris ad pedes 
ejus. For the Hebrew word does not mean the devil, 
as those think, but a pestilential fever. For such fevers 
are wont to be very injurious. And the same opinion 
is repeated. For not only do the prophets repeat the 
same thing, but all Scripture has this usage. 


V. 6. He stood and measured the land. 


Another picture, which also Moses describes in the 
second book Cap. 14, 19. f., and it happened, that 
after the children of Israel had gone out of Egypt, 
Pharaoh followed with an exceedingly well-equipped 
crew, with chariots and horsemen, in order to destroy 
the people of God, and then, as God thus preserved 
His people, the angel placed himself between both 
armies, so that the Egyptians could not advance that 
night or injure Israel. For so it is clearly written in 
Moses: "The angel of the LORD came between the 
army of Egypt and the army of Israel" 2c. This is what 
the prophet calls here, that the land is measured. 
Then, as he adds: 


He looked and cut down the heathen, 


Did he use almost the same words as Moses in the 
second book of Moses, Cap. 14. For Moses says the 
same thing in the same words [Cap. 14, 24. f.]:. "And, 
behold, the LORD looked upon the host of Egypt, out 
of the pillar of fire and cloud, and made a terror in their 
host, and thrust the wheels from their chariots, 
overthrowing them with impetuosity." This is how 
GOD fights by His sight alone, namely when He 
instills horror and fear in the hearts of those He wants 
to destroy. With such an easy effort, those who are 
best equipped are overcome and fall, and they flee, 
and cannot withstand, namely, when they are the 
opponents. 


1544 L. xxvn, 209-211. interpretation of Habakkuk (2.), cap. 3, 6-8. 


1545 





The Egyptians also said [Ex. 14:25], "Let us flee from 
Israel; the Lord is fighting for them against the 
Egyptians." 


That the mountains of the world were shattered. 


In figurative speech he calls "the mountains of the 
world" the princes and great ones with whom is the 
supremacy, as also Moses speaks in the fifth book 
[Cap. 33, 15.]:] "According to the desire of the 
sovereignty of the world.” And this separation and the 
stooping of the high ones happened. 


As he walked in the world. 


For this is how | translate according to the Hebrew. 
For the Hebrew word means both eternity and the 
world, as it is said in the Psalm [Ps. 24:7], "Lift up the 
doors of the world," where we read [in the Vulgate], 
the eternal [aeternal] doors. The Lord has 
Therefore he divided the flocks and bowed down the 
high ones of the world, because he himself walked in 
the world, that is, had contact with his people, walked 
among them as their duke and victor, as he had 
promised. 


Vv. 7. | saw the huts of the Moors in trouble. 


In our Latin translation, the darkness of the words 
is so great that one would rather say it is an 
incantation than a prayer; in fact, nothing else can be 
inferred from this passage. But it is again another part 
of the painting, another radiance (radius) of the Lord. 
Therefore, because our interpreter translated very 
badly, | give it after the Hebrew thus: "| saw the Moors' 
tents in trouble, and the Midianites' tents sorrowful." 
For what our interpreter has translated by iniquitas is 
in Hebrew the word p.y, of which we have said above 
several times that labor means, in German, "toil," as 
appears from Ps. 90:10: "If it has been delicious, it 
has been toil and labor." And it is the opinion: The 
Mohren, the Midianites and all the other peoples 
became restless and were seized with a great fear 
when they heard of the coming of this people, 


1) However, the expression: eollium aeteruoruna is found here, but 
the citation is from Gen. 49, 26. 








which the Lord had so wonderfully and with such a 
strong hand and great signs led out of Egypt and had 
delivered out of the hand of Pharaoh, because it had 
been led wonderfully through the Red Sea, but 
Pharaoh had been drowned in the meantime with his 
whole army 2c. The Moors and the Midianites are 
neighboring peoples, especially those who are called 
Egyptian Arabs, who live on the western shore of the 
Red Sea, because there is the crossing to Egypt, as 
the maps show. 


sAnd the Midianite tents grievedZ 


"Tents", because they did not build with such great 
expense, as we do in Germany or in other areas, but 
lived in tents, just as our Turks today also laugh at the 
foolishness of the Germans, that they hew so 
precious, as if oh they would always stay here. But 
they have taken this from their ancestors, namely 
from the Arabs, from whom they originated. - Curtains 
(cortinae), 2) that is, tents made of curtains. 


V. 8. Would you not be angry, O Lord, in the flood? 


This whole verse can be understood either in a 
negative or in an affirmative way. But the prophet 
shows his heart movement in it. Here he stops in his 
heart movement and admires that great work of which 
he had said above. Therefore, if we want to 
understand it in a negative way, this will be the 
Opinion that he is talking about the grace and 
goodness of God by which he has preserved his 
people, and even let them escape the flood 3). If it is 
taken in an affirmative way, he is talking about the 
anger and indignation of the LORD with which he 
resisted Pharaoh and drowned him in the sea with his 
whole army. But it seems to me that the Hebrew way 
of speaking has to be understood more in a negative 
way, as it is said in the Psalm [Ps. 95, 11.]: "I swore 
in my wrath: They shall not come to 


2) The word eortiune is highlighted as a keyword in our original, but 
it will be the explanatory word to peil, which is here in the Vulgate. 

3) In our original lumeu. This is not a misprint, because the Erlanger 
also reads this way. We have assumed lumen. 


1546 xxvii, 2ii-2i3. Interpretations on the prophets. 


come to my rest." And so, through the negation, he 
expresses the affirmation in this way: Thou wast 
angry with the adversaries, thou didst destroy them; 
but us thou didst save. As if he wanted to say: Are 
then the signs of the wrath, that he leads us through 
the waters? Not at all. For with such great grace he 
preserves us when all the nations are raging. He 
leads us safely through the flood in a wonderful way. 
And that | approve of this opinion, | am moved by the 
fact that the prophet here describes the salvation of 
the chariots. For the Israelites came out of Egypt 
equipped with trucks and other chariots, as can be 
seen in the fourth book of Moses [Cap. 7, 3]. Thus, 
the prophet makes abundantly known his 
exceedingly great movement of heart by mentioning 
the benefits of God and strengthens himself as if to 
say: These are strong horsemen and swift chariots in 
which God drives. 


V. 9. You drew out the bow. 


This is another part of the painting. He 
understands in this picture the killing of 1) Sihon, the 
king of the Amorites, and Og, the king of Bashan, 
which is described in detail in history (Num. 24, 24. 
ff.) and the Psalms [Ps. 135, 10. f. 136, 17. ff.]. For 
after they had passed through the sea, they were 
attacked by these kings, who overcame them through 
the Lord. But the word "bow" must be taken quite 
simply, as it reads, for warfare and armor, so that it is 
not necessary to invent a spiritual bow, as some have 
done. For the prophet used this word in quite the 
same way in the 78th Psalm, v. 9: "The children of 
Ephraim, who held the bow, fell at the time of the 
battle." That is, the tribe of Ephraim was brave, it led 
the wars, it had to do the war service 2c. Therefore 
the meaning is: The LORD drew forth his bow, that is, 
he performed his war service in his people, he made 
them strong by his power, that they might be subject 
to all enemies, as he had also promised victory, and 
that he would be the enemy of their enemies [Ex. 
23:22, 27]. Here again follows

Sela, 

Which is also added above [v. 3]. But what is 
meant by this word has been disputed among all 
ecclesiastical writers, both Greek and Hebrew, from 
the beginning of the early church to the present day. 
The seventy interpreters have translated it by 
didwadua, that is, a pause or cessation. | hold entirely 
with those who say that it is a kind of supplement for 
a gap or an empty space in the verse, just as our Latin 
and Greek poets often insert filler words in verses out 
of necessity, in order to make the number of verse 
feet full. Otherwise they could be omitted, since they 
add nothing to the sense 2c. 


You divide the streams into the land (in terra). 
Now he describes the passage through the 
Jordan. 


V. 10 [The mountains saw you, and they were afraid]. 

But here are all person poems, as they are also in 
the Psalm [Ps. 65, 13.]: "The hills are merry all 
around." Likewise elsewhere [Ps. 114, 4.]: "The 
mountains skipped like lambs, the hills like young 
sheep." | think it is a synecdoche that by "the 
mountains" the people are meant who live on the 
mountains, as if he wanted to say: You can divide the 
rivers, and this the people saw. That is why they bear 
sorrow, they have suffered birth pains (for this is the 
meaning of the Hebrew word), that is, according to the 
manner of those who give birth, they have grieved, 
"they were afraid". They were dismayed and terrified, 
they despaired of their strength, namely, seeing that 
you were so mighty with your people that they could 
walk in the waters also. (See the beginning of the fifth 
chapter in Joshua.) 


The depth could be heard. 
He sat together in a summa, as if to say: both the 
depth and the height serve them. 
V. 11. Sun and moon stood still. 


Here he summarizes two works. The first one, 
when the sun and the moon stood still, 


1548 L. xxvil, 213-216. interpretation of Habakkuk (2.), Cap. 3, 11-14. 


1549 





until the Israelites had avenged themselves on their 
enemies. See Joshua Cap. 10, 12. f. The other work: 


Your arrows passed with brilliance. 


The same is described in Joshua Cap. 10, where 
the Lord, when the five kings were killed, sent a great 
hail on those who fled [Jos. 10, 11.], as history says. 
This thunderstorm he describes here. "Arrows" he 
calls the lightnings, which are the arrows of the 
LORD, as it is also said in the Psalm [Ps. 144, 6.], 
"Let lightning flash, and scatter them; shoot thy 
beams, and terrify them." 


V. 12. You trampled the land in anger. 


According to the Hebrew | translate thus: In anger 
you walk in the land, in fury you crush the nations. (In 
the country namely in Canaan. That is, in a great 
majesty of anger you walk, because many 
adversaries of your people are there, whom you 
destroy all. Here he groups all the other peoples of 
Canaan, who have set themselves against Israel, the 
people of God, into one, as can be seen in Joshua. 


V. 13. You went out to help your people. 


So far he has described all the histories that 
happened after the Exodus from Egypt, before they 
took possession of the land that was promised to the 
fathers. Now he adds the histories, in which he 
shows what works the Lord had done, since the 
Neichruhig was, after they, since the hostile Gentiles 
were completely defeated, remained at home. But he 
describes the histories that happened under the 
kings, and especially under Saul and David, when 
they had taken the land and dwelt in it. Therefore he 
describes them going forth. "The anointed of the 
LORD" he calls the king, both Saul and David. For so 
the Scripture also calls Saul, though he was ungodly. 
For he also often fought very happily, and that for the 
sake of the people, to whom the Lord had promised 
that he would be with them and fight for them, as the 
promises say 2c. 


You crush the head in the house of the wicked. 


The Hebrew reading connects this generally with 
the preceding. But I, if | could only dare, would like to 
connect it with the following. But which of both views 
is to be regarded as the better one, | leave 
undecided. For it may be understood in two ways: 
first, that he speaks in the singular instead of the 
plural, as he also called "the anointed of the Lord" the 
kings. And so the opinion, which | do not approve, is 
that he speaks of different kings, namely, of the king 
of Moab, of the Ammonites, of the kings of Syria 
2c.,0f all of which he says that they were broken up, 
namely, by the kings of Judah and Israel. But | would 
like to understand it of the king of the Assyrians, that 
he has broken him of the house of the wicked, that 
is, deprived him of the kingdom 2c. But if someone 
does not approve of this opinion, | will not object. But 
"to strip the foundations" and "to shatter the head" 
means to shatter the kingdom and to deprive it of the 
king, whom the Scripture calls "the head", to leave 
the great multitude without king and leader- and this 
is also called "stripping" by the Scripture, as Moses 
says about the stripping of the head. 


Up to the neck. 


This image is extremely hard and alone in this 
prophet. But he adds a twofold image by which he 
wants to designate the princes, since he says about 
the uncovering of the foundations, calling the princes 
"foundations"; then that he calls them "heads" 2c. 


V. 14. You wanted to curse the scepter of the head 
with its spots (Maledixisti sceptris ejus cum capite oppidorum 
ejus). 

This actually goes against the king of the 
Chaldeans. For here he again presents a new 
painting. However, he combines it with the king of the 
Assyrians (for so, | believe, the previous passage 
about the king of the Assyrians must be understood), 
since he adds: ejus, as if he still speaks of a king of 
the Assyrians. It is therefore the opinion: The 
kingdom of the Chaldeans is not yet destroyed, like 
the other kingdoms. 


1550 L. XXVIL, 216-218. Interpretations On the Prophets. 


1551 





and kings, but now his destruction is imminent. The 
sentence is pronounced; you have cursed his scepter, 
now execute it, O Lord, let that come to pass which you 
have threatened. Let the king of the Persians come and 
avenge our reproach, for you have cursed his scepter 
with the head of the cities, that is, Babylon. 


That come like a weather to scatter me. 


In Hebrew there is only one expression where we read: 
venientibus ut turbo, just as if he said: the tempestanti- 
bus. For this is how the Hebrew language uses such 
dainty words. But the opinion is: Until now our kings have 
suffered many things, we have been miserably plagued 
by other hostile kings and nations, but still you, O king of 
the Chaldeans, have been our fiercest enemy. For thou 
hast assailed us like the weather, and afflicted us 
miserably, and led us into captivity, and not only that: we 
serve thee for a mockery, thou despisest us, thou art so 
hopeful of the victory thou hast gained, that thou 
rejoicest even when an ungodly man oppresses a poor 
man secretly, that is, with impunity, where there is no 
judge to avenge the wrong. And this is what the prophet 
means when he says: "And rejoice as if they were eating 
the wretch in secret." 


V. 15. Your horses walk in the sea (Conculcasti in mari 
equis tuis). 
That is, before, we were victorious over our enemies 
everywhere through GOD, as many as they were, as He 
also said above [v. 8J: "Since you rode on your horses, 
and your chariots kept the victory." But now we are 
overwhelmed with tribulation, now you have trampled us 
in the sea, that is, in tribulation. 


In the mud of large water. 


It is the same expression in the 69th Psalm, v. 2. f.: "The 
water comes up to my soul. | sink in the deep mud where 
there is no bottom; | am in deep water, and the flood 
wants to drown me." With all this he _ indicates 
exceedingly great tribulation. It is also quite the opinion 
of this passage how he further explains this trampling, 
since in what follows he tells how the Chaldean disturbed 
them. 


V. 16. Because | hear these things, my belly is 
troubled. 


As if he wanted to say: You plagued us 
extraordinarily, you oppressed us, we crawled, as it 
were, in the mud of great waters. When | heard this, my 
stomach was saddened and my lips trembled, that is, the 
boasting and scoffing of your horsemen and men of war, 
who trampled and ravaged us, caused me great 
heartache. 


Pus goes into my bones. 


This is also a way of speaking peculiar to this prophet, 
and it is the opinion: "My bones became weak with fear, 
with shame, when | had to hear all this. And "I am 
afflicted with myself", that means, only with me, what 
concerned me, | was afflicted, as we say in German: "Ich 
saB und fra sich darum. 


O that | might rest in the time of trouble, when we 
go up to the people who fight against us. 


That is, our people were led away into captivity; those 
who disputed us (latrocinabantur), who made us 
prisoners in the war, kept the upper hand against us. For 
this is what the Hebrew word actually means. 1) The 
Lord had allowed them to have the upper hand against 
us; no prayer helped, as also Isaiah says [Cap. 64, 7.]: 
"No one arises to hold you" 2c. But now peace will return 
for us, we will return unharmed to our kingdom, we will 
be snatched out of the captivity with which you now 
oppress us, and you now have the curse. That is why, 
when you oppressed us like this, | could not rest. 


V. 17 For the fig tree shall not flourish, neither shall 
there be any increase in the vine. 

That is, everything was devastated, so great was your 
rage against us, SO great your tyranny.

remark refers to the word tatroeiriAi-i, which here stands for war 
services thun, as also otherwise the word latrunoulus in the Vulgate 
stands for man of war.

That is, the oil tree bore no fruit, however well it 
was worked. 1) 


And sheep are torn from the hurdles. 


That is, the Chaldeans robbed everything so that 
nothing remained in our land. 


V. 18. But | will rejoice in the Lord. 


That is, | will give thanks to the Lord because of 
our salvation. For it will one day come to pass that 
the king of the Persians will be subject to you; you 
will no longer be able to exercise your tyranny over 
us. Destruction is in store for you, but we shall be 
returned to Jerusalem unharmed, and therefore the 
time will one day come when | can again be joyful 
and praise God. The same is what the prophet David 
says in the Psalm [Ps. 42, 12.]: "Why do you grieve, 
my soul, and are so troubled within me? Wait upon 
GOD, for | shall yet thank Him that He is my help and 
my GOD." 


V. 19. He will make my feet like the feet of a deer. 


This is taken from the Psalm, for the same words 
are also in Psalm “Ps. 18, 34.], "He maketh my feet 
like hinds,” 2c., that is, he will give me a happy 
outcome to my affairs, he will be gracious, he will 
lend. 


1) This explanation refers to Luther's view that he opu8 olivus refers 
to the work that the oil tree does, that is, bears fruit. 


that | may have my course safely, both in the ministry 
of the word, and in that the kingdom is inviolate, as 
he adds here: 


And will guide me on high. 


That is, the kingdom will still flourish. Because he 
includes here the kingdom after the return, as if he 
wanted to say: It will happen that | will be led back 
again from this mud into the glory, in which you 
trample us now. 


That | sing on my strings. 


This word is very frequent in the titles of the 
Psalms, which one translates by the Greek, that is, a 
triumph song. And so the opinion is: | will still ride 
high, | will still be placed high again, with victory 
songs on my strings. In the German translation of the 
Psalms, | have translated this word like this: "hoch zu 
singen". That means, such a psalm should be sung 
with a high and bright sounding voice; we usually call 
this voice the discant. Hence, the opinion is: On high 
| will sing with rejoicing and with gladness. Now | am 
afflicted, now | am oppressed, but in a little while it 
will come to pass that | shall also glory again, that | 
shall be glad, namely since we are brought back from 
captivity. This is a short summa of all the preceding, 
in which he indicates all the fruit of the redemption 
from captivity. 

End.

1555 





3, interpretation on the prophet Habakkuk, 


according to the Zwickau manuscript. *) 


From Luther's lectures from July 18 to August 2, 1525. Printed in 1886. 


Translated from Latin. 


About Habakkuk. 


First, the question arises about the short epitome of 
this prophet. Some think that this prophet worked at 
the time of the Babylonian captivity, when the two 
tribes were led away by Nebuchadnezzar, and so he 
directed his prophecy against the king of the 
Chaldeans 2c. This they have from Daniel, but this 
story does not have sufficient standing since it is not 
in the Hebrew Canon 2c. The matter must be 
considered simply according to the circumstances. | 
consider that he was just before the Babylonian 
captivity. 





That is, that he prophesies to the remaining two 
tribes about the future kingdom of the Chaldeans. 
Therefore, the prophet now has to deal with 
announcing the future destruction of the two tribes, 
and after that: the kingdom of the Chaldeans will not 
only destroy the two tribes, but also a large part of 
the earth, because of their sins. Note the history of 
Hezekiah. He was a godly king, but he turned away 
2c. - Therefore he threatens the sinners with 
destruction, both in the people of God and among the 
other nations. 


[The first chapter. ] 


Vv. 1-3. This is the burden that the prophet 
Habakkuk saw 2c. 


"The Prophet", 1) this is a proud title which no 
other prophet has attached to himself. [Instead of: 
Vociferabor ad te vim patiens] it should be: "I call to 
you about iniquity", so that it is a speech of the 
prophet, which is directed against the people, as if he

and misfortune | see. "You show me", himself) "must be 
there that | see." He (Jerome) 1) understands the hostile 
disturbance and violence. But in very many places this 
is also attributed to tyrants and leaders of the 
commonwealth, who devour possessions and bodies, 
and devastate the land more than wars or enemies. We 
understand it from the iniquity of the people among 
whom the prophet sojourns. - Coram me, "around me", 
as far as | can see. 


Force prevails over law. 


The text, which is inserted here, must be deleted. 
Some Kligling or cheeky man has added it. 2) So it must 
stand like this: Why do you hear me speak, "and show 
me violence and iniquity? 3) There is violence over 
right". He seems to indicate that those disturbances and 
iniquities were in the people 2c. In war the laws are 
silent. Those who fight take pleasure in disputes and 
cause them. As if to say: No matter will be dealt with 
rightly, nothing will be heard 2c. Those instigators of 
strife 2c. Contention has the upper hand; if there is any 
matter, those who are quarrelsome and love strife are 
victorious 2c. Everything is tyrannical and violent to 
disturb the people of Israel; no right 2c. 


V. 4 (Damm gehet es gar anders, denn recht (propter 
hoc lacerata est lex).) 


The Hebrew does not say /acerata lex. In the first 
book of Moses [Cap. 45, 26.) it says: uasi de gravi 
somno excitatus s "he thought much differently"). It 
means (2) a movement

and a hesitation or a wavering. The law has no progress, 
it has no success in its administration, it is changeable, 
it has a waxy nose, it is bent everywhere, the law wavers, 
vacillates, it does not stand firm in its judgment. Not the 
law, but the violence of tyrants is to be seen, therefore 
"no right cause can win. In the sixteenth (?) Psalm [Ps. 
17, 2. Vulg. (?)) is such a Hebrew expression. And no 
right thing comes to victory,’ that is, what the law 
prescribes does not happen, (it) "comes to nothing." It is 
said of the people, not of the war, where the right is not 
in books, but in the weapons 2c. 


For the wicked overrules the righteous, therefore 4) 
wrong judgments go. 


Tortuosum [judicium], that is, unjustly rendered 
judgments. In this is the reason why the law is in disarray 
and does not gain a right thing: because the wicked 
surrounds (circumvenit) it. "Surrounded like a crown" 
means the word in the Psalm [Ps. 22, 13]: "Great ferns 
have surrounded me" (coronaverunt). This is how it is 
among the people; the wicked have such the upper hand 
that they surround the righteous with deceit. Therefore it 
cannot happen otherwise than that wrong or crooked or 
abominable judgments are passed, as the ways are 
apart from the right road or path. It is said more clearly 
in the book of Judges in the song [Cap. 5, 10.]: "You who 
walk in the way" 2c. In the people there is absolutely no 
severity against sin and no care for sin, against which 
the prophet has often and sufficiently preached. This is 
followed by the threat. 


v. 5. Look among the Gentiles, behold and be 
amazed 2c. 


Instead of obstupescite [et admiramini] it should 
rather read admiramini. Lucas (Apost. 13, 41.) refers to 
this passage. Following the Septuagint, he cites the text. 
He adds many words that are not in the Hebrew. Instead 
of "among the Gentiles" very many have: the despisers. 
Behold among the Gentiles, look and marvel or wonder.

word sackmiramini, but set twice). This language puts| 
words twice, [as], veniens veniens. At times, however, it 
repeats for the sake of emphasis: Astonish yourselves, 
astonish yourselves! Sometimes this doubling has the 
meaning of distribution: "here and there". Virgam 
virgam, virum virum, that is, any rod [, any single man) 
2c. 


For | will do something in your days which you will 
not believe when it is said. 


Behold, you have sinned against the Lord, you have 
despised, therefore see your punishment. Among the| 
Gentiles you will see it 2c. Marvel at the new thing, for a 
great thing shall come to pass. "In your times", in a little 
while it will happen, this punishment of yours will no 
longer be postponed. But you do not believe that it will 
happen 2c., although it is announced to you now. So do} 
we all. This judgment is general for all unbelievers, 
because great things are proclaimed to them and they do 
not believe. The prophet speaks of the destruction by the| 
king of the Chaldeans, Paul (Apost. 13, 37. ff.) of the 
resurrection of Christ. Paul makes a general statement, 
not a specific or particular one, as the prophet does here. 
Christ and the apostles often use general sayings and 
apply them to the case at hand, as that passage [Luc. 6, 
39]: "One blind man leads another" 2c. Likewise [Luc. 14, 
11.], "He that exalteth himself shall be abased." Such is 
this saying, which we ought and may use in great things 
which are said to come to pass 2c. So it happened in the 
resurrection’ of Christ, as here in the disturbance of the’ 
king of the Chaldeans: no, it will not happen 2c. They did 
not want to believe, since it was necessary to believe. 
What then is this great work? 2c. 


B. 6. For behold, | will raise up the Chaldeans. 


The text is clear. Consequently, the prophet worked 
before the time or around the time of the ver-.

The destruction or captivity of Judah and Benjamin. This 
saying must be applied to all the great works of God, 
which the flesh does not recognize; when it is 
proclaimed, it ridicules such. Thus Lot said in Sodom 2c. 
The works of God are higher than all understanding of 
the flesh. Through its guilt the understanding of the flesh 
is deceived; even if it is proclaimed, it does not believe. 
This unbelief will finally turn out to our misfortune, but He 
continues to do what He has decided. Here you see that 
it is the Lord who works all things in all. Here he says that 
he will infuse his spirit into the king of the Chaldeans 2c. 


A bitter and quick people who will move as far as 
the land is. 


It indicates the size and quantity of the army. As far 
as the land stretches, there pours out the army of the 
Chaldeans. 


To occupy apartments that are not his. 


He opposes this to those who in his people silently 
raised the objection against his prophecy: God has given 
us this land. He will defend us, we will stay. No, he says, 
rather these people will not only take your land, but also 
other lands 2c. 


V. 7. and will be cruel and terrible. 
This is a terrible and terrifying people. 


That there gebeut und zwinget, wie es will (Ex ipsa’) 
judicium ejus et onus ejus procedet), 


He wants to say: You have neglected the right, you 
have turned the law where you wanted, you have not 
wanted to judge right in peace, now finally the judge will 
come who will avenge 2c. He is terrifying, he will come 
and teach you, and therefore the judgment will come 
(which he exercises, not which he suffers). It has not 
been administered by you, therefore another must 
administer it; you do not judge, therefore you will be 
judged. What is not done by you will be handled by him 
2c.

V. 8 Their horses are swifter than the horses of the 
parades; they are also more biting than the wolves of 
the evening. Their horsemen move with great piles (et 
diffundentur). 

[In the Vulgate it says: Leviores pardis equi ejus et 
velociores lupis vespertinis [their steeds are lighter- 
footed than the parades and faster than the wolves in 
the evening. It is ["wolves in the evening"] an 
ambiguous word. They are wilder than the wolves in 
the morning [, Jerome says, because they have 
suffered hunger all day]. 1) "Let it sound as well as [it] 
can," | like better: the wolves of the desert, as we say, 
"That the wild wolves tear you!" To make the thing 
great, we add this epithet, because this wild beast 
rages more than another. It can be outwitted at times 
2c. "For the pardes." This animal is unknown to us; 
we believe Scripture that its course is exceedingly 
swift. Here is an exaggerated speech. [Wolves] of the 
wilderness, or wolves in the forest. Et diffundentur 
sund they will spread out]. Since Moses [3 Mos. 13, 
5? says of the leprosy that spread on the skin 2c., he 
uses the same word. 2)

And it is true because the kingdom of the 
Chaldeans is far away. Nevertheless he will be there

fast, especially to the aase 2c., to the food 2c. Like 
an eagle to the food. 


V. 9: They all come to harm. 

The text is dark, but the meaning is clear. He sticks 
to the description of that great work, which nobody 
believes when it is said about it, namely the 
disturbance by the king of the Chaldeans 2c. Entirely 
or "all together": he himself, the king, will come with 
all power to rob against their face, like the east wind. 
He wants to say: there is nothing that anyone can 
hope to resist; he will come with force to the attack.

The face of those who will resist him. He will do 
violence with the great army, completely he will come 
to violence or to violence against the face of them, 
like 3) an east wind. Chaldea lies to the east of the 
Jews, that is, not only from that region of the world, 
but also with violence. Thus it is said in Moses [2 
Mos. 10, 13. Vulg.]: "The LORD sent a burning wind" 
2c. In Hebrew it says: a wind from the east. It is dry, 
just as the others, especially the south wind, bring 
rain. 4) 


Wherever they want to go, they will tear through like 
an east wind; and will gather captives like sand. 5) 


Like the wind that no one can hold back, that army 
breaks through. Like sand on the sea is an 
exaggerated speech. He will come with exceedingly 
great force like a wind, sund will gather captives "like 
sand", 6) that is, innumerable and infinitely many. He 
wants to say: Not only the Jews will he take captive, 
but also any kings, and that so easily that it seems to 
be a game to him, because of the extraordinary 
quantity of the army. 


V. 10 They will mock the kings, and the princes they

effort to make an island a mainland. Jeremiah says [Jer.

"| will give him Egypt for a reward" 2c. because he fought 
so valiantly against Tyre [Ezekiel Cap. 26]. Elsewhere it 
is called "the firm 2) city" [Jos. 19, 29.), likewise 
elsewhere Zur (Sur). He took it with great difficulty. He 
[the prophet) seems to allude to this city because it was 
fortified; but its fortification was nothing 2c. The army "is 
too great and mighty". 


V. 11 [Then they will take a new courage, will go on

Instead of corruet it should read "and sin". The text 
[in Latin) is dark. He wants to say: as it is wont to happen 
in human affairs. The human heart is much too 
incapable to keep itself in: Well-being could keep itself. 
It follows elevation of the heart; in Daniel: hopefulness. 
In prosperity the heart is hopeful, in adversity it is 
downcast. In such great prosperity it cannot be other 
than that its heart also rises up against God. See Daniel 
[Cap. 4, 27.]: "The great Babylon, which | have 
subdued." This "I" cannot stand GOD. - Mutabitur 2c., 
his heart will rise up. In the book of Judges. 3) He will 
continue and not believe that heaven can resist him. He 
will attribute this victory to his idol, this his strength or 
victory is of his God, that is, he will assume that this 
victory came from his God. He distinguishes this from 
the true God. To have another God means to trust in our 
own presumption. An idol is nothing but a conceit of [the 
true] God, but still a false one. He errs by attributing this 
to his God 2c. The true GOtt seeks what is ours, not 
what is His. They have devised services of God, of which

The root of all idolatry is our delusion of God. They 
attribute it to their powers, as our princes do. 


V. 12. But you, Lord, my God. 


This prophet has his own way of speaking. He 
opposes these two gods, the false one and the true one. 
He wants to say: He will attribute his victory to his God, 
but you, my God, who are holy 2c., is it not you who also 
gives victory to the wicked? He allows everything for the 
sake of sins. Now he fights with GOtte: Why do you allow 
the exceedingly ungodly king to destroy your people? 


My Holy One, who you are from eternity. 

As if to say: Rather, it is you who have always, from 
eternity, been my GOD and my Holy One. The Holy One 
in Israel is called God in the Scriptures because He is 
holy and makes His people holy. The Psalm says [Ps. 
33, 17.]: "Neither do horses help" 2c. You who also give 
victory to godless kings, it is you who gave the godless 
king this victory, which he nevertheless attributes to 
another God 2c. For this you are our God 2c. 


Let us not die. 


The prophets look to the people after this captivity, 
envisioning the future kingdom of Christ. Therefore, this 
captivity seems to be against the promises. Therefore, 
the prophets struggle to preserve the people so that they 
will not despair that the kingdom of Christ will come. 
They would return because in this tribe the Messiah 
would be born 2c. In this you are our God, that we do not 
die. Though we may be caught and led away, though we 
may suffer, we shall not perish.

The king of the Chaldeans is laid upon our backs as 
a scourge, which he himself does not recognize. 
Isaiah says [Cap. 10, 7.], "Though his heart think not 
so." Note [the similitude] of the saw 2c. [Isa. 10, 15.] 
"Purely off, purely off" “say Ps. 137, 7.],eradicate this 
kingdom. No, says GOD, but for chastening and 
scourging | have set it. "I will chasten thee with 
measures, not that | make an end of thee" [Jer. 46, 
28.]. He indicates that the people of Judah should be 
brought back for this reason, so that Christ might be 
born out of them according to the body, even though 
he is not concerned with measure and chastening, but 
with destruction. 


And let them, O our refuge, chastise us only. 


He wants the people to wait for the promise to 
come to pass 2c. Posuisti and fundasti [thou hast 
established and founded], that is, thou hast made him 
strong to chasten us, not to our destruction; "there 
belongs" faith "to", the flesh does not understand it. 
The flesh immediately imagines death, and as an 
eternal disturbance "took hold of [it]". 1) Faith says: It 
is only atemporal chastisement, the Lord is preserved 
in the midst of death. 


V.13. Your eyes are pure, so that you cannot see 
evil, and you cannot see misery. Why then do you look 
to the despisers? 2c. 


He wants to say: He sacrifices his victory to his 
god, although you give it. Why do you do this? He is 
guided by a great movement of heart for the people; 
he looks at the lowliness of the people of God and the 
arrogance of the exceedingly wicked king. Why do 
you suffer that this godless one? 2c. Why do you not 
take another, a godly one? This is what the weak 
consciences think: This one is two times worse than 
we; if a pious man punished me, | would put up with 
it. You have pure eyes, so that you cannot take 
pleasure in wickedness. And yet you act in such a way 
that it seems as if you take pleasure in this work of the 
godless king, as if you

"Lust" in it "habest". 2) "An arch rascal, [a] knave does 
this; what do you delight in it?" He is twice as angry 
as | am. "Why do you then look to the despisers?" 
Thou canst not see the wicked, and yet thou doest it 
here, and actest as if thou hadst pleasure in seeing 
them 2c. For Nebuchadnezzar is ungodly, who 
serves idols 2c. They do not see that it is a chastening 
of God upon them. 


V. 14: And let the people go like fish in the sea. 

So it is better because of the ambiguity sals in the 
Vulgate: Et facies homines quasi pisces maris]. Thus 
dealest thou with the king Nebuchadnezzar, that thou 
makest all nations before him as fishes 2c., that is, as 
wanderers, having no king, but being swallowed up 
like fishes and worms, which only wander about to be 
caught. A great multitude without a head is only a 
multitude exposed to slaughter. Thus before this king 
all nations, especially the Jews, are given up to 
robbery 2c. 


V. 15: Pulling all things with their hams, and falling 
with their nets, and gathering with their gam. 

"All", that is, the kings, the peoples. "With the 
Hamen" the great fish are pulled out, the common fish 
(vulgus) "with nets". "With the Hamen he draws all," 
that is, first he catches the first, the kings and the 
mighty among the people 2c., afterward the rest of 
the common people of the fish are caught with yarn 
and nets. "Is this a pious GOtt", is this the work of 
GOtt? 2c. 


They rejoice and find joy. 
That godless king will rejoice in his victory. 


V. 16. Therefore they sacrifice to their net and burn 
incense to their yarn. 3)

Nebucadnezzar. He attributes inactivity to GOtte, the

Victory.-"Therefore", 1) because of these victories. 
That in which someone trusts, the prophets call 
another God, therefore he says: "his net". He says 
from the trust our works. He [the king] thinks that the 
victory came through his net, not through the Lord. 
He has great lands as his portion, but he attributes 
everything to his net. 


Because through them their part has become so fat 
and their food so complete. 

"Food", that is, riches, treasures, kingdoms and all 
that he devours, is since and strong. He speaks of

Nebuchadnezzar devoured.

says [Cap. 10:7], "His heart thinketh not of it." He 
says that this belly is not to be satiated: the more he 
takes, the more he desires 2c. By all these things it 
is inflamed; so much is lacking that it would be 
satiated, "would gladly devour it altogether" 2c. The 
whole world was not enough for Alexander, the 
young man of Pella, he was sorry 2c. "Isn't it the 
devil" that the human heart is so insatiable? As our 
self-love grows 2c. So also the lust for power grows, 
the more the power grows. So this king always 
continues to rob, attributing his victory to the idol 2c. 





The second chapter. 


In the foregoing we have seen that the coming of 
the Chaldeans over all peoples and Gentiles is 
clearly described. So the prophet worked before the 
captivity. Here the punishment on the Chaldeans is 
described. Therefore he lived before the captivity, 
and until he saw it, as did Jeremiah. Who does not 
want this, may say that he writes after the way of the 
prophecy, what will happen afterwards. The 
prophet's attitude and purpose is to keep the people 
in faith, so that they will not despair of the kingdom 
and the prophecies of the promised Christ. The flesh 
saw something else. The prophet fights against this 
weakness in the people in the whole prophecy in 
order to preserve and strengthen the weak in faith. 
He presents a likeness of a guard and watcher and 
keeper, he imagines a kind of fight against the faith 
of the weak. Think of the prophet, how he serves in 
his prophetic office, who upholds the people, and 
those who believe that it has happened to the 
kingdom of Judah, that God is going away from his 
promises. 





against these. Against these he says: "Do not doubt! 
Stand, stand! Be strong in faith, all that is promised 
will come to pass, you will see the kingdom 2c. "I 
stand and sit upon my breast of defense." 2) 


V. 1. Here | stand on my guard, and tread upon my 
stronghold, and watch and see. 

In the manner of a guardian and watchman 
against those who reproach me. He encourages 
himself, he raises his heart and mind against the 
trembling people, as if he wanted to say: "I will stand 
in defense. | will do it like a faithful guardian, who 
remains undaunted at his post, stands where one 
must stand 2c. 


What shall be said to me, and what shall | answer 
him that reproacheth me. 

"What is said to me", namely by the Lord. As if he 
wanted to say: You think it has happened for the 
kingdom, and our prophecy is void 2c. In the word 
"rebuke

lies the whole meaning of this chapter. He fights 
against the tongues of the weak, not against 
weapons: "How fine" we are led by the prophets, "how 
beautifully we have started" 2c. Against these 
poisonous tongues the prophet stands up: "Even if 
you were useless", | will still carry out the office of a 
true prophet, and comfort those whom you want to 
destroy 2c. | will hear from the Lord what | shall 
answer you blasphemers and failures. 


But the Lord answered and said unto me, Write the 
vision, and set it on a tablet, that whosoever passeth 
by may read it. 

Now he says what the Lord said 2c. This is a 
prophetic and divine way, taken from the fifth book of 
Moses [Cap. 27, 4. 8.] and also used in other 
prophets, namely that some sign was connected with 
the word, as it appears from it: Jeremiah [Cap. 27, 2. 
shows this] with the wooden yoke, by which he 
indicated the Babylonian captivity, which he preached 
by the wood and by the word. Isaiah preached that 
Egypt should be deprived; he went naked, and 
confirmed the word which he preached by a similar 
doing [Isa. 20:2]. Thus our baptism indicates that we 
are to be put to death according to the flesh, but made 
alive according to the Spirit. Thus Isaiah writes, Cap. 
8, 1. f., he seals, he takes witnesses; afterwards he 
prophesies against two kings. So here; he preaches 
a certain vision of the future of Christ, he adds a sign 
by which he indicates that what he says will soon be 
fulfilled. By "vision" understand not merely that of 
Habakkuk, but of all the prophets, as in Daniel [Cap. 
9, 24. Vulg.]: "That the vision might be fulfilled." He 
does not speak of that which was then, but of the 
prophecy which is said of the Christ to come, as here. 
Write with clear and distinct letters, that they may see 
clearly that by which they are reminded, and be sure 
that that which is foretold shall come to pass. Orally 
you say like the others: The kingdom of Christ will 
come. That [face] write, show it with the finger 2c. 
Write it clearly, in a clear way 2c.; with strong strokes 
(kdrte): The kingdom will come from Judah.

not be taken away, Christ will come 2c. Behold! this 
vision shall be fulfilled. This saith the LORD unto me, 
that | may answer it unto you that reproach me. 


That it can read who walks by. 


That is, write so clearly that it is not necessary to 
stand for a long time, so that it can be read in passing, 
that the reader can walk a little, or 2c.; so that the 
reader is not delayed, he wants it to be written clearly 
with large letters. This is the sign, now the word will 
follow: 


V.3 The prophecy will be fulfilled in its time. 1) 


At the appointed or certain time, procul "shall not 
be there". 2) He wants to say that this prophecy 
proclaimed in the prophets still has its time and is not 
finished; it is certain, not one article is changed. 
Actually it is said: Since the prophecy still has its time, 
that is, it is not absent, it will come in its time, as it is 
predicted by all the prophets. 


And will finally come free to day. 


Lucas translates this word by trapnoidZé,lv 
(Apost. 18, 26. 26, 26.)]: "preach freely". Ps. 12, 6.: 
"teach confidently." He will speak confidently, 


publicly, and freely, "freshly, freely, confidently." [Et 


parebit is as much as:] And will be free in the day. 3) 
Completely free it will appear in its time. One must 
await the end of these things until his word comes. All 
[he says] therefore, lest the people despair of the 
promises. The tribulation is great, therefore he must 
also use great words.

And do not stay outside. 


[God] "will not leave us sitting." He describes with very 
rich words that the promise will be certain. 


But if she be consumed (moram fecerit), wait for 
her; she will surely come and not be forgiven. 


So that they do not say: "It becomes too long, traufe" into 
another country, it warps from day to day. After all, may 


it warp, harre, it will not miss. [Instead of illum it would 


be better to use €amM ["ihrer"], so that the change of the 
genus does not give rise to questions. "Remember not 
sorrow." It is preached quite clearly in words what he 
wanted; the painting is quite clear 2c. He now chides his 
reproachful and his blasphemers, so that he may do 
justice to his office in every respect, so that he may 
punish in whatever way he can, as if to say: Beware, you 
who will not be moved, neither by image nor by word, 
which after all | have from God. 


V. 4. [Behold, he who is stiff-necked will have no 
rest in his heart.] 1) 

He who does not believe, but remains in blasphemy 
against me, his soul will not be right in it (in €a), so that 


ea must be referred to the prophecy, that is, such a 
blasphemer's soul will have no pleasure in this prophecy, 
that is, he will have no part in this vision, he will have no 
pleasure in it’, as it is said in Jeremiah [Jer. 17, 6.]: "And 
will not see the comfort to come." In the Evangelio [Luc. 
14, 24J it is said, "Of the men none that are bidden shall 
taste my supper." So here: will not be right, will not be 
satisfied, that is, will not be at ease, will have no pleasure 
in this prophecy, will have no pleasure, "will not enjoy 


theirs." _Incredulus], actually: he who resists and 
defends himself against prophecy, as the ungodly and 
blasphemers. But those who defend themselves, even 
though they are convicted by the truth, and who, with 


their ears closed

and eyes will not see and hear, because they deprive 
themselves of so great a grace, in whose hearts there 
will be no delight in that [prophecy] 2c. In the Epistle to 
the Hebrews the author, who followed the Septuagint, 
rendered this passage thus [Heb. 10, 38. Vulg_]: 
["Whoever will withdraw, in him my soul will have no 


pleasure"; subtrahere, that is,] 2) retrahere, that is, with 
hands and feet they resist 2c. See to it that we are not 
also children of deviation, but of faith. The threat is 
against the blasphemers, against those who reproach 
and accuse. 


For the righteous lives by his faith. 


This passage is very well treated in the Epistle to the 
Hebrews. In a summary, he concludes that the godly 
must await the promised kingdom. If you believe, you will 
live. This saying demands faith not only in the prophecy, 
but also in the gospel that is to be preached 2c. | cannot 
put it into your hearts; | have done my duty. If you 
believe, you will live; if not, you will die 2c. 3) 


We have heard the first part of this second chapter, in which there 
is a revealed prophecy of Christ. Although the words are short, he 
interprets them very richly. For the prophets sometimes hardly touch 
the subjects. 

The other part, as it describes the destruction of the kingdom of 
the Chaldeans, also as it was exceedingly powerful and strong 2c. He 
therefore directs our hearts upward [to the one] who can accomplish 
through himself what he promises. At this point a new chapter should 
begin.

to be the original, whereas what follows in the manuscript from the 
earlier scribe is an adaptation. Therefore, it places the latter in the 
notes: "In the text," it says, "we naturally give the original." We cannot 
share the various assumptions of the Weimarsche (Einl. p. XV s.), 
because otherwise it would be over with the assertion (Einl. p. XV) 
that our writing is "a direct college notebook.

overloaded with food and drink. "A drunken house spits at the host, 


so it will do to him." - [Instead of: et non] decorabitur would be 
better: you will not stay, or he will not stay. He describes that figurative 


(metaphoricam) drunkenness. - "Which unlocketh his soul like hell," 
that is, his covetousness. "Hell"; of the same it is said in Scripture 
[Proverbs 30:16] that it is insatiable. Likewise in Isaiah [Cap. 5, 14. is 
a similar passagej. It cannot be filled by what has been stolen from 
others, just as death has a maw that cannot be filled. He takes all 
peoples' possessions and wealth. But no violence is of long duration; 
he will not remain. 


V. 6. But what is it? All of them will make a saying of him. 


Against that drunken king they will raise proverbs and riddles. He 
will make a proverb out of the whole kingdom, as Virgil did of the 
regions where Troy was. 


Woe to him 1) who increases his wealth with the wealth 
of others! How long will it last? 


What comes quickly, passes quickly, evil gained, evil lost. 
And only loads a lot of mud on itself. 


Lutum densum is "mud". An excellent saying! This piling up has 
brought them nothing at all, except that it has collected mud. Thus he 
saws: "Whom many fear, many must necessarily fear. That is to say, 
to heap mud upon himself, since he [gathers] kingdoms. 2) [The 
tyrant's speech is They may hate, if they only fear. That kingdom will 
not endure, the displeasure of the nations will soon rise up against 
you and destroy your kingdom. It will be the same for our peasants. 
GOD has begun to chastise them, but they do not accept it, therefore 
2c. 


V. 7. 3) O How Suddenly those who bite you will wake up, 
and those who push you away will awaken. 

He presents a likeness of a sleeping tyrant. But a tyrant is fearful 
by nature. They are easily put in fear, even by a flea. So you sleep 
safely, but you do not know that you will be awakened so suddenly, 
suddenly, thinking that it is peace. 

V. 8. for you have robbed many nations. 

This mud will oppress you; this kingdom will not last longer than 
the third generation. As powerful as itis, it will perish quickly. Reason 
does not believe this. - [Jerusalem] he calls "the city" because in it 
alone was the worship of God. 

The other sin is avarice, by which he has sucked all the nations 
dry, by which he has burdened the people with "all too great" tributes. 

V. 9 Woe to him who is stingy to the misfortune of his 
house, that he may lay his nest on high, that he may escape 
disaster! 

You did this for the sake of saving yourself from misfortune. This 
is characteristic of tyrants, that they look for hiding places that give 
them protection, but

V. 10: You have sinned with all your might (peccator anima 
tua). 


"The soul" (anima) denotes the disposition by which we are filled, 
as Moses [2nd Book, Cap. 15, 9.] says of Pharaoh, "I will draw out my 
sword, and cool my courage upon them." 


V. 11. For even the stones in the wall will cry out. 


Nothing seems certain to a tyrant. When he hears a crash of 
stones, he thinks that danger threatens him. Thus, those who were 
not frightened before by so many preachers are frightened by this evil 
conscience in their sleeping chambers. For in their evil conscience it 
seems to them that the walls threaten them, so even everything 
frightens them. In such a way also the poets have a person poetry: 
The field laughs 2c. Thus he lets the stones speak here, which are to 
accuse his conscience. 

And the bars on the locked will answer them. 

As if he wanted to say: In your sleeping chamber you will hear the 
crashing of the beams, and this will frighten you, and you will think: 
Behold, that find admittedly sins, injustice. In other circumstances, 
they think that everything is safe. 

Woe to the one who builds the city with blood and builds 
the city with injustice! 

This is the third sin, where cruelty is connected with murder. 5) 
That is, "with injustice". 

V. 13. What the nations have worked for you must burn 
with fire. 

The sense is that which Augustine teaches from Jeremiah [Cap. 
51, 58.] 6) The last sin is this: 

V. 15: Woe to you who pour out your neighbor's drink and 
mix in your anger. 

He speaks of the king of the Babylonians. - "That you may see his 
shame." The cup and drinking means wrath and vengeance. The cup 
that makes them drunk. In Jeremiah [Cap. 25, 15, we read that he 
shall take the cup and give it to the Gentiles 2c. Drinking is nothing 
else than suffering misfortune. It therefore indicates the exceeding 
cruelty and rage of the kingdom. Woe to you who have given your 
neighbor the cup in which you have mixed your wrath. Zechariah 7) 
[says Cap. 1, 15.]: "lam very angry with the proud Gentiles" 2c. Thou 
hast made all too drunken, that their nakedness was seen. The simile 
is taken from drunkards, like Noah, who lay shamefully there. 


V. 16. So now you also drink, so that you stagger. 


As if he wanted to say: | must make you drunk again, so that you 
stand there, so that all nations see your nakedness. 


And must spit shamefully. 


Vomitus ignominiae, that is, a shameful spitting; as one who 
spits shows that he has taken too much, so 2c.

[The third chapter. 


Cap. 2, 5. But wine deceives the proud man. 

It should be a new chapter. So itis to be read: But 
how the wine deceives. A proud man is like the wine 
that deceives, cheats or makes easily contemptible. 
He wants to say in this way: The wine makes the man 
reprehensible and bad. So it must be translated: As 
wine makes someone contemptible, as there are the 
drunkards, the gluttons; as it happens to those who 
have such a demeanor before too much wine that 
they are also mocked by the children, because they 
load themselves up with too much wine, so it will be 
with my proud man, that is, with the king of the 
Chaldeans. They are drunk with wine, that is, they 
have filled themselves with other people's goods, 
with other people's work; "it will go with them" 
according to the proverb, "A full house spits out the 
host." Because you have filled yourself too much, 
therefore you will not be adorned, you will not remain 
powerful. This expression is ambiguous, XXX means 
to dwell or to make beautiful palaces. Therefore, it is 
applied to the beautiful. In the Song of Moses [2 Mos. 


15, 21] it is said: | will adorn (ornabo), that is, | will 
make Him an adorned temple and a_ beautiful 
tabernacle. In this way it may be taken here also. - 
"The man," that is, the king with the people will not 
remain in their palaces, but will be spit out. 1) They 
are drunk. This he interprets: For they have filled 
themselves after the manner of a drunken man. 


Who locks out his soul like hell. 

He describes that drunkenness in figurative 
speech. It is insatiable. They rob what belongs to all 
peoples. "The soul," that is, its desire, like hell, which 
is said in Scripture to be insatiable, as it is said in the 
Proverbs of Solomon (Cap. 30, 16] and in Isaiah, 
Cap. 5, 14. Death 


1) Here the Erlanger has: sruovsntur; the Weimarsche: 
6voin6ntur. We have followed the latter reading. 


does not say: It is enough. He has an insatiable maw 
that could not be satiated. He has seized the 
possessions of all peoples, their riches, their 
possessions. "That is to say, he has drunk his fill of 
wine." But he will not remain, because no violence 
lasts forever. He lays out how he will not stay, how 
the house will spit him out. 


V. 6. But what is the point? All these will make a 
saying of him. 

He wants to say: They will seize a saying, a 
proverb, which refers to this king, a Rathsel. 


"Rathseln,” propono, in the Psalm. In the book of 
Judges (Cap. 14, 12.fj, where Samson said, | set 
before you a riddle. The tongue puts forward a 
question. One will speak against the king, who is 
drunk with the goods of all nations, and exceedingly 
boldly they will speak out. In one word the prophet 
has taken away the whole kingdom, saying that they 
will sing of it in proverbs. And the regions where Troy 
was, - so that [poet] makes a proverb out of the whole 
kingdom. As if 2) the destruction had already 
happened; this will be the proverb: 


Woe to him who increases his wealth with the 
wealth of others! 

Badly won, badly lost. What arises quickly, passes 
quickly. The foreign property, "how well it is received 
by him," as the grass is received by the dog! The 
other part of the proverb: 


How long will it last? And only loads a lot of mud 
on itself. 


Densum lutum, "mud," void things. A figure of 
speech of the Hebrews. You do not cease to heap up 
"mud" against yourself, that is, the hatred and 
displeasure of all the nations you afflict. An excellent 
proverb. What has he achieved by this piling up? 


2) Weimarsche: quuru; Erlanger: quarr". We have followed the 
latter reading. 


1576 D. XXVII, 188-140. interpretation of Habakkuk (3.), Cap. 2, 6-10. 


brought? Nothing but that he has brought mud upon 
himself. He whom many fear must fear many. So take 
that again for it, that the peoples and cities hate you, 
as those 1) said: They may hate, if they only fear. A 
rule, which is attained by friendship, is stronger than 
that, which is brought about by force. All nations will 
be forced to serve you, but when the opportunity 
presents itself, they will immediately rise up against 
you and destroy you. Thus, God threatens the 
princes through the peasants. They will not be 
moved, they will not acknowledge the benevolence of 
God who has punished them, but will provoke Him to 
be even more angry. God will cause an uproar in a 
short time 2c. All these words of the prophet we can 
apply to our times. "How will it come to pass?" 


V. 7.0 how suddenly those who bite you will wake 
up, and those who push you away will awaken! 2c. 


He presents the likeness of a sleeping tyrant who 
is fearful by nature, who is afraid of the crash of a 
board or fire. So it threatens you. Thou sleepest 
securely now, and knowest not that suddenly some 
one cometh 2c., namely, the kings of the Persians 
and Medes; suddenly, as thou thinkest it not, as thou 
sayest, It is peace and safety. They shall awake, 
whom thou thinkest to be asleep, and hold it with 
thee. These will come and bite you, as, the king of the 
Persians. 


You have to give it to them. 
To rob. As you have robbed them, so they will rob 
you. 
V. 8. for you have robbed many Gentiles 2c. 
This is the mud that will press you down. This will 
happen because of your main sin, which is: 
For the sake of the blood of the people, and for the 


sake of iniquity in the land and in the city. 


The prophet makes the Babylonian captivity the 
main sin by which he took Judah and Jerusalem. The 
prophet does this for the comfort of the weak people.

1577 


The Lord has not forgotten you, but will punish this 
sin of the king. The Lord has not forgotten you, but 
will punish this sin of the king. You are the first whom 
the Lord will avenge; you should be sure that this 
kingdom will not last. This was unbelievable, as it is 
unbelievable today. The kingdom that was so 
flourishing was nothing, so quickly it perished. See 
the book of Daniel at the end [Cap. 12, 10.]; they did 
not believe what was prophesied, yet some believed. 
The prophet here emphatically calls Jerusalem "the 
city", as if only this One city was in the whole world, 
where the worship and the word of God was. So far 
he has spoken of the first sin, now the second 
follows. 


Vv. 9 Woe to him who is stingy to the detriment of 
his house. 

The first sin was the suppression of the word of 
GOD, which is the highest sin of all; the other is 
avarice, which made all the nations weak and sucked 
them dry. For the prophet indicates that the king and 
princes of the Chaldeans were exceedingly stingy, 
since they burdened the people with excessive 
tributes in order to fortify the cities in which they could 
remain secure against all enemies, but they did 
nothing. - "To the misfortune of his house," that is, 
this stinginess will finally be to the detriment of the 
house. 


That he may lay his nest on high, that he may 
escape the accident. 

You wanted to make this city so high that you 
would live exceedingly high and be safe against all 
nations, and for this you used unjust extortion. - 
"Accident." See how God looks at hearts. You build 
beautiful nests for yourself, that you may be safe. 
The tyrants do not trust anyone. Now they seek very 
safe oerters, that they may be safe against all 
accident. This did not take place 2c. 


V. 10 But your counsel will be a disgrace to your 
house. 


The counsel will turn against your head, against all 
the people and the princes of the Chaldeans. Since 
you have oppressed many nations, you have sinned 


with all your might (pec-.

cator anima tua). 1) "The soul" denotes such a sense 
as when someone sins with all his heart, therefore 
because the soul is full of selfishness 2). Moses says of 
the king Pharaoh [2 Mos. 15, 9. Vulg.]: "I will draw out my 
sword, and my soul shall be satisfied", "I will cool my little 
mill". "All thy little weary [thou] hast cooled" in sinning. 
You have sinned from no other cause than pure 
wickedness. The following saying proves that this is the 
Opinion. 


V. 11. For even the stones in the wall will cry out. 


The prophets "have just seen" the heart movements. 
Nothing is certain to a tyrant. A rustling leaf frightens 
them. He flees from "a crash" in the bedchamber. When 
we are alone in the sleeping chamber, when the 
buildings are lowered, there is a noise and a crash. 
When those who are careful hear the cracking of a beam, 
they are immediately frightened and think that there is a 
large number of enemies. And this happens because 
they have an evil conscience, because it occurs to them: 
this is brought about by the sweat of the poor. That which 
they did not want to glorify so many preachers before, 
causes a crash afterwards. We say: "The world is too 
narrow for him", since stones and walls seem to speak, 
since everything seems hostile. On the other hand: a 
field or a meadow laughs, it seems to address us with its 


loveliness, the beautifully embroidered curtains (aulaea) 
wish you happiness. These are personal poems. So here 
is a poetic speech that makes the stones and the beams 
talk, because they accuse your conscience that the wall 
was built with injustice. 


And the bars on the locked will answer them. 


Augustine calls the wood suscudes, by which one rod

joined to another, and that one rod is joined to another.

holds. That is, in your camp you will hear the crashing of 
the buildings, whether they be of wood or stone. And this 
will frighten you, you will think: This has been acquired 
unjustly. The third sin: 


Woe to him who builds the city with blood! 


That is, by murder. This is a still more terrible robbery, 
that he not only extorted taxes in a miserly way, but also 
"with blood", that is, that you killed many, made widows 
and orphans, and shed blood. The prophet speaks 
against the whole empire, that such people were in it, 
who accused the innocent, so that they could build 
beautiful palaces by robbing them of their possessions. 
This is what tyrants do everywhere, including ours, and 
they do not pay attention to how great a sin it is. 


And wrecks the city with injustice. 
Through unjust judgments, by which you have extorted 
many things.

Isaiah says about the time of Christ, that there will be 
such a rich knowledge that it seems to be more than 
a flood of sin. Wherever the gospel may be, the land 
of the knowledge of God will be full. Here he adds 
"the glory". And it seems that the prophet does not 
speak of the time of Christ, but of the destruction of 
Babylon, as also Gen. 14:21: "As | live, saith the Lord, 
so shall all the earth be filled with the glory of the 
Lord." This must be understood to mean that he will 
kill all who murmur, and that he will display his glory 
abundantly. Ex 9:16 says, "That my name may be 
proclaimed in all the earth." Just as after Pharaoh 
was slain God was glorified and exalted in the heart, 
so after Babylon is destroyed | will cause all nations 
to give me glory and say that it was by the hand of 
the Lord that it was destroyed. 


The last sin: 


V. 15: Woe to you who pour out your neighbor's 
drink and mix in your anger. 
For he speaks of the king of the Babylonians. 


And make drunk that you see his shame. 
This is quite a poetic picture. The Jewish fables are 
nothing. Lyra says the

Weimar edition into the preceding inset (but with square brackets). 





Babylonian king had made Hezekiah drunk. 2) The 
Jews have the gift of making their glory great more 
than the Greeks. The cup and the drink denote wrath 
and vengeance. [Likewise] fire, snow, hail in the 
Psalms. As if to say, "He will pour you out.” Thou hast 
drunk the cup of the LORD to the bottom, says Isa. 
51, 17. "Take this cup of wine full of wrath from my 
hand, and pour out of it to all the nations," [says the 
LORD to] Jeremiah, Cap. 25, 15. Therefore there "to 
drink" is nothing else than to suffer wrath; ["to pour" 
is] "to give a good distemper; | have earned that, 
doggedly." There they say, "He drinks it." Therefore, 
the prophet indicates the excessive severity and 
cruelty of this kingdom. Understand it from the 
general drinking of all nations, and from the particular 
one of the people of Judah. "Woe to you," that is, you 
have given him the cup of suffering. Christ also 
speaks in this way. So you mixed your wrath into this 
cup. | was only a little angry; those added more, as it 
says in Isaiah [Cap. 54, 7. 8. Zech. 1, 15. The king 
thought that God's chastening was a destruction. The 
prophet does not say: You have poured on your 


neighbor, but: Thou hast added thy fury (furorem, not 


fel [gall]). That is, you have done more than | 
commanded. | wanted all the nations to drink from the 
Babylonian cup, and so you made them drunk. You 
have not only poured, you have plagued, but you 
have made too much of it. 


That you see his shame. 


This likeness is taken from a drunkard who lies 
exposed to his shame. Thus thou hast made thy 
people drunk, that nothing of honor and goods is left. 
"Thou hast taken [it] away altogether." Thou hast 
made them full of shame, and without glory, that thou 
alone mightest be. 


2) According to the Latin: Lad“lonena ro‘in in6kriA886 “MeNiuna 
can be both the king of Babylon and Hezekiah the one who makes 
drunk. We have assumed the latter because it is called a nonsensical 
Jewish fable through which the Jews seek glory.

V. 16: You also drink so that you stagger. 
et consopire). 
| will comfort you who suffer from the king; "he will 


drink again". - Consopire. One does not see what [in 
Hebrew] has such a meaning. [It should read:] 


circumcidere. | will make thee drunk again, that thou 
shalt lie there uncovered, that all the Gentiles may 
circumcise thee, as they that shall be circumcised are 
uncovered. 


[For you will be surrounded by the cup in the right 
hand of the LORD.] 

"The cup in your right hand." | will not only pour 
the cup into you, but a great calamity will befall you, 
which will surround you. The cup is not just a man's 
cup, but God's cup, which you will not be able to 
resist. 


[You must spit shamefully for your glory.] 
| do not know what the word [, which in Latin is 


rendered by vomitus, in Hebrew] means. [Therefore 
| follow the reading of the Latin interpreter,] 1) that it 
means a shameful spitting. Just as one who spits 
shows that he has taken too much, so you will show 
your misery by your exposure. 2) This is so that it 
may be seen that he is referring this to the land of 
Judah, to which the Babylonian 3) was exceedingly 
hostile because he hated the word of God. 


V. 17 For the iniquity committed in Lebanon shall 
overtake thee. 


Iniquitas Libani, the outrage, not that Lebanon 
committed, but that he suffered. That is, the wrong 
you committed against Lebanon will be amply repaid 
to you. The land of Judah is called by familiar names 
in distant places, as in Psalm [42:7], "In the land of 
Jordan and Hermonim," 2c. Thus here "the iniquity of 
Lebanon," that is, which thou didst commit in the land 
of Lebanon.

whole prophecy goes against the Babylonians. 





that is, which is around Lebanon. It is too forced to 
say that it was because of the altar that was made of 
the trees of Lebanon. Disturbance will come upon 
you who have disturbed everything. Hitherto he has 
prophesied what he will punish the Chaldeans for the 
sake of his people. Now follows a kind of mockery. 


V. 18. What then will help the image that his Master 
has formed? 

The last section of the second chapter is still left. 
Up to now we have heard the prophecy, which 
expresses threats against the kingdom of the 
Chaldeans, because of its various shameful deeds, 
by which it has deserved [punishment. At the end he 
adds a mockery in which he almost imitated Moses, 
Deut. 32, 37. where he enumerated the misfortunes 
that would befall the Jews 2c. "Where are now thy 
gods?" [v. 38. .ff "Let them arise and help you." After 
this example, the prophet mocks the king of the 
Chaldeans, as if to say, All these evils will come upon 
you. If then thou hast a God, call upon him; let him 
arise and protect thee, in whom thou shalt put thy 
trust. 


And the cast image, 
Which you have worked perfectly, let it help you. 
The wrong picture. 

The one who made it relies on it, that is, the king, 
the kingdom, the Chaldeans made themselves an 
idol in which they trusted. Now that the calamity is 
coming, they may trust. It is a mockery, "dumb idols." 
Thus the Jews used to mock the other nations, Ps. 
115, 3. f.: 4) "Our God is in heaven", "the idols of the 
Gentiles" 2c. 


V. 19 [Woe to him who says to the wood, Awake! 
and to the dumb stone, Arise]. 

"Woe," namely, to the king and the kingdom. "To 
the wood", to the God who is made of wood

is made. As the Jews say to their idol, Arise, you who 
sleep, so say also to him, and see if he arises. Your 
idol is a dumb stone. With force and emphasis it is 
spoken that he calls their God so. Here he makes a 
comparison. Call upon him to give counsel, that thou 
mayest escape and advise thy things. Behold that he 
is dumb wood. In trouble they will leave thee when 
they should help thee most. 


[And is no breath in him.] 


Omnis spiritus means according to the Hebrew: 
There is absolutely no breath in him, that is, there is 
no life in him at all, he is a dead stone.

in both languages, Hebrew and Greek. | will go about 
it [and do] as much as | am able. The title rather 
clearly testifies that it is a prayer, and not a song. 
Thus you have the prayer of Moses, where he does 
not sing, but calls and laments, confessing his 
misery. So here, where the prophet confesses and 
praises GOD, and asks for deliverance from 
captivity, Pro ignorantiis | take here in the same way 
as the 7th Psalm, v. 1. has it, "The innocence of 
David," that is, a guilt is laid upon me of which | 
(David) am not aware; where it is nothing else than 
innocentia. Thus Job says [Cap. 9, 21.]: "If | am 
pious, then my innocence may not be called 
innocent.

God with the God of the king of the Chaldeans. He 
lives in such a way that the whole earth is forced to 
be silent before him, that is, it must fall silent before 
him, cease its boasting and put its finger on its mouth. 
Isaiah says (Cap. 41, 11, when the Lord speaks, they 
are silent. This short word comprehends the Old and 
the New Testament. This God is known before the 
preaching of the gospel. The face of the Lord ("before 
him" - a facie ejus) indicates his knowledge or future. 
Through the gospel the face of the Lord is revealed 
and known as he himself is present, and before this 
knowledge of the presence all the world will cast off 
pride; then all boasting of idols will cease. 1)

V. 2. Lord, | have heard your rumor that | am terrified. 


*.uckituin tuum, that is, your rumor, your word, and | 
am put in fear. He does what others are wont to do, as, 
in the Bible of Judges Cap. 5, 2. ff. in the Song of 
Deborah. First he presents the short epitome and then he 
digresses. He presents the general things that have been 
shown to the people, 1) and then other special things. 
Thus in the 18th Psalm, v.2: "| love you dearly, O Lord" 
2c., so that he confirms the following. Thus in the Psalm 
[Ps. 68], "Let God arise, that His enemies may be 
scattered." So [he begins] here with the execution from 
Egypt. For this is the ordinance of all the prophets and of 
the [Hebrew] language, so to repeat all histories from of 
old. Thus, if one wants to praise a martyr, one must 
mention the suffering of Christ. Thus he praises the 
salvation from Egypt, how the enemy [was put to shame], 
2) in a great digression and paints it, as it were, on a 
curtain. He enumerates various incidents and presents 
them in general. This means: | have heard your rumor of 
all the miracles and works that you have done from the 
beginning to this people, which you had led away captive. 
The spirit is terrified by the presence of the divine 
majesty, it is terrified at the proclamation of these things. 
But cold people think nothing at these things, feel 


nothing. - Illud must be eradicated. - It is a Hebrew way 


of speaking, like Ps. 1, 4: Like the chaff which the wind 
scatters.

Do as you used to do before, within the years, do not 
postpone it. Thus Hezekiah says [Is. 38, 10. Vulg.]: "In 
the middle of my days [I must go to the gates of hell", 
and in the Psalm it says, Ps. 55, 24.:] 3) "The wicked will 


not bring their life to the half" (non dimidiabunt 2c. As 
if to say, | have barely begun to live. So we sing: 4) "In 
the midst of life we are embraced with death." Thus, in 
the midst of the years, God comes to the rescue when 
everything stands in despair 2c. "When the rope holds 
hardest, it breaks in two." This is how GOtt comes to the 
rescue in the tribulation. Thus it is said to Job [11, 17. 
Vulg.], "When thou shalt think thou art gone, 5) thou shalt 
arise as the morning star." Everywhere the help of God 
will come in the midst of temptation and affliction-[Vulg.] 
"Make your work alive." He uses glowing words; he 
means the Babylonian captivity: as thou hast always 
delivered us before, so make thy people stand and live. 
Show thyself in the midst of the years, since now thou 
seemest to be hidden. Within or between the years. 
"Dear, come, strike in the midst, break in two the years." 
Break off the long duration, cut away the delay, "come 
away, break off," and reveal yourself to be our God. 


sWhen tribulation is there, remember mercy]. 


[Instead of: cum iratus fueris, misericordiae 
recordaberis in the Vulgate, | translate according to the 
Hebrew thus:] In perturbatione _ recorderis 


misericordiae. [This is spoken] not of the perturbation 
of God, by which He is perturbed, but by which we are 
perturbed. [The Hebrew word is also] in the fourth Psalm, 
"If ye be angry, sin not." So elsewhere [Gen. 45:24], 
"Quarrel not in the way." The Hebrew word denotes our 
restlessness and impatience. In the Psalm it says [Ps. 
85, 9/: "Oh that | should hear that GOD the LORD 
speaketh," 2c., "that they might.

Do not fall into folly," that is, so that they will not become 
impatient. He does not let them be tempted beyond their 
ability [1 Cor. 10:13]. When the temptation is "most 
fierce, he plumbs in, not letting 1) it last too long." This is 
the epitome and the object of what follows. Now he 
digresses according to the way 2c. The Holy Spirit 
teaches to pray like this by the example of the prophets. 


V. 3. God came from the midday, and the Holy One 
from Mount Paran. 


Now he puts forward the embroidered curtain; he 
represents person poems. The verba which [in the 
Vulgate] are in the future tense are to be taken as 
presentia. GOtt comes from the midday) "that is the 
GOtt" 2c., that is, from Egypt, near which is the mountain 
Paran, and KadesBarnea 2c. "Paran", beauty, is the 
name of the desert that is near the tribe of Judah, which 
is also called Kades Barnea.

praise (confessio @jUS) goes as far as heaven and 
earth." [His praise] covers [the heavens], not above but 
below, 4) that is, under the heavens the power and 
presence of GOD was praised. That is, everywhere 
under the heavens the praise of GOD was spread. "And 
of his praise the earth was full." He is talking about the 
exodus from Egypt. All people spoke of the power of 
God.

sense is the same. [His praise covers the surface of the earth, not 
what is stretched over it. 


V. 4. His brilliance was like light. 


"Radiance," that is rays. It means the shining light or 
he rays. It means they will be spread far and wide, that 
s, its manifestation, the glorious manifestation of its 
resence spreads its goodness everywhere, that is, it will 
e spread under the sky. 


Glances went from his hands (Cornua in manibus 
pjus). 


Cornua stands for rays or shine, like the face of 
Moses, which 5) shone by means of the rays of his hand. 
[That is, his virtues and miracles shone, and the same 


shines (CorMua), that is, rays, spread out under heaven 
and over the whole earth. 


There secretly was his power. 


"There", namely in this glory. That means: His power 
had its dwelling in Paran 2c. As if he wanted to say: He 
did not make this power known among other peoples, but 
there was his power 2c. 


Vv. 5. Pestilence went before him. 


Here is a new section, a new content, a new painting 
ie field. Now follows what these miracles are, of which 
e has just said. He wants to show these rays, how the 
sky is covered, he says, of which things 2c. Which are the 
wonders will follow. He is detailed in the enumeration of 
the miraculous works until he comes to the Babylonian 
captivity. - "Before him went pestilence." Here we must 
lace the beginning of the painting of this prophecy, in 
hich he describes what rays he had wished to indicate, 
since he spoke [of them] above, namely, the exceedingly 
agen works and wonders by which he wished to make 
name for himself on earth. First: Before him went 
ny the pestilence. For he smote the Egyptians 
efore the Hebrews went forth. This was the first plague 
with which he struck Egypt. He passes briefly from one 
work to another. Since he went out from the midday, 
Eo went before him, that is, first he struck the 


gyptians. 


5) Instead of Huig, we have assumed. 





1590 L. xxvVIL, 1S1-153. interpretations on the prophets. 


And plague (diabolus) went out wherever he stepped. 


This belongs to the previous saying (Versum), it is a 
repetition of the previous sentence. And there went out 
an evil spirit, or rather pestilence, at his feet. For the word 
means pestilence, or a pestilential fever which suddenly 
kills. It is therefore a repetition, as it were, of the previous 
saying: And the fever went out at his feet, that is, when 
he went out, he killed all the firstborn of the Egyptians; in 
one night he killed them. 


v. 6. He stood and measured the land. 


Aspexit, that is, he looked. This happened when 
Pharaoh's army followed the children of Israel to the sea. 
There the angel stood in the fire, measuring (Ex. 14:19 
ff.), and stood in the midst of the two nations, so that they 
could not come together all that night, that is, he 
separated one nation from the other at the Red Sea, 
because the angel stood between them. This miracle "he 
meant", that is, he separated one nation from another, 
one land from another. 


He looked and cut down the heathen. 


These are almost the words of Moses [2 Mos. 14, 24]: 
"When the morning awakening came, the Lord looked at 
the Egyptian army" 2c. This is God's way of fighting, that 
He fights by His sight alone. He does not have swords, 
although he uses thunder and lightning. Sometimes, 
however, this is his main work, that he takes the courage. 
Then all forces are gone, the fearful one flees. This is 
how God fights, even if they are equipped with armor. 
Thus Moses says that he fought: "The LORD looked 
upon the host of Egypt," that is, the Egyptians felt in their 
hearts the presence of GOD, therefore they said [2 Mos. 
14, 25.], "Let us flee from Israel, 1) for the LORD fights 
for them." - "He cut in pieces," that is, he made them flee 
without order, abandoning their post.

That the mountains of the world were shattered and 
the hills in the world had to bend down. 


Here he spoke of figurative mountains and hills, which 
poetically denote the princes who are the mountains in 
the world. Thus Moses says in the fifth book [Cap. 33, 
15.], and elsewhere, in the first book, Cap. 49, 26, 
"According to the desire of the sovereignty of the world." 
The kingdom of Israel shall flourish above all wishing, 
that is, as the hills of the world are wont to wish’ that a 
kingdom might be full of wealth, power, and happiness, 
so shall the kingdom of Israel be.-"And stooped down." 
Not only are the princes struck down and crushed, but 
they also fled with their faces bowed down, "their heads 
bowed down." All this is described, as it were, in the 
manner of a painting, but accurately. 


As he walked in the world. 


[Instead of ab itineribus aeternitatis ejus in the 
Vulgate is to be translated according to the Hebrew:] 
From his walking in the world, [or,] since he walked in the 
world, for signifies both world and eternal. "The 
everlasting doors" it is said in the Psalm [Ps. 24, 7. in the 
Vulgate]. One must look at the circumstances; | take it 
here for world. Not with weapons has been fought here, 
but by the going of GOD, and | read: Since GOtt walked 
among them, as He was in the midst of them at the 
Exodus [from Egypt]. In the Psalm [Ps. 68, 25.] it says, 
"As you, my GOtt, walk among them." In the fifth book of 
Moses [Cap. 33, 27.] it is said, He has arms on top in the 
world, 2) that is, He consorts with men, and by no carnal 
power did He conquer the Egyptians, but "He walked in 
the world," and thereby the princes of the world are 
crushed and bowed down. 


v. 7 | saw the huts of the Moors in trouble, and the 
tents of the Midianites in distress. 


The Moors and the Midianites, peoples neighboring 
them, became agitated and trembled at the arrival of the 
Hebrews and the splendor of GOD. - "The tents." "With

words one invokes the devil." 1) It is another work, 
another part of the painting. When they came out of the 
sea and sang to the Lord and made it known to the 
whole world, the Midianites and other peoples were 
troubled. At that time, as we read in the Song of Moses, 
they were hardened because of the great work, because 
the splendor of the divine work was shining. The Moors 
and the Midianites are neighboring peoples. They 
passed through the Midianites. The Arabs are adjacent 
to the Moors, they are a part of the Moors. On the 
western shore it [the Red Sea] has the Egyptian Arabs; 
between the Red Sea and Egypt are the Arabs 2c. He 
says of two peoples. XXX actually means "trouble" 


(dolorem). [Ps. 90, 10.:] "If it has been delicious, it has 
been toil and labor." | have often said [XXX and XXX is] 
"toil and labor." | read the text this way: | have seen the 
huts of the Moors in toil, that is, | have seen this country 
and the inhabitants of the Moor country in the common 
painting as afflicted people, in fear in their huts. These 
peoples are generally shepherds and country people, 
they live in huts, especially the Arabs. The Turks ridicule 
our nonsense of erecting such magnificent buildings. 
"Huts," as if we would not live here forever. This has the 
Scripture. Here the Scripture calls the dwellings "huts," 
as is said of Abraham [Gen. 12:8, 13:18, 18:1]. 


And the Midianite tents grieved. 


XXXXX 2) is cortinae [curtains], that is, tents, 
because they were without wood and stones; "huts" 
were. The part stands for the whole, that is, tents made 
of curtains. We have heard that this was done in the 
histories of the Exodus of the children of Israel.

can be understood both in a negative and in an 
affirmative way. The prophet shows his heart movement 
in the painting of this work; at the passage through the 
Red Sea, he said, all the nations were dismayed, 
shattered and terrified. Here, he stands still in the 
movement of his heart and wonders. Both were the truth: 
If you take it in a negative way, he is talking about the 
grace that happened to the Hebrews in the Red Sea, 
through which he saved his people. If taken affirmatively, 
he speaks of the wrath and vengeance in which he 
drowned the Egyptians in the Red Sea. This way of 
speaking is mostly a negative one, as in the Psalm [Ps. 
95, 11.]: "They shall not enter into my rest." [Ps. 89, 36.:] 
"| have sworn: | will not lie to David." "So stiind's fein" in 
a negative way, and the following 4) piece confirms [this 
view]. By negation he expresses affirmation. "Wouldn't 
you be angry?" Certainly you were angry, but at our 
enemies, for us; us you loved and saved, "is this anger?" 
Are the signs of wrath that he leads through the sea? so 
that by negation he expresses an affirmation the 
stronger. To whom the affirmation is better 2c. The 
opinion is therefore: Since he looked at all the peoples 
of the earth, "Behold" how angry he becomes with us? 
no, how fiercely he loves us, that he leads us through 
waters and the sea, saves us! He expresses the mercy 
of God through the negative question. As if he wanted to 
say: No, but the highest mercy he has shown us there. 
Why? "Because you rode on your horses," that is, with 
your horses and chariots, that is, with your army you 
were there; moreover, it is seen that they also had 
external weapons, horses and chariots. Of all this that is 
touched is said to be of God. He speaks of the army. As 
he walked in the midst of them, so he also rode in 
chariots and rode on horses. So we read 4 Mos. 7, 3,

that the princes of the tribes offered six chariots, namely 
they used the chariots more than the horses; they had 
therefore chariots. He speaks here with words that are 
taken from warfare, as Moses also indicates [Ex 13:18] 
that the people of Israel were prepared. The prophet is 
in great emotion and comforts. Here you see the 
warfare, the horses, the chariots, where God is the 
leader. Therefore, there is salvation and victory. "I mean, 
be angry!" 

V. 9. You drew out the bow. 

This is another part of the painting. You see the part 
of the painting where Og, the king of Bashan, and the 
Amorite king is killed 2c. With short words the prophets 
speak great. Things. "The bow." This one expression 
refers to all warfare in general. The children of Ephraim 
alone wielded the bow (Ps. 77:9), and this denotes the 
whole armor and warfare, that is, they waged the wars, 
they were the wielders of the dominion, 1) the warfare 
was with that tribe. "At the time of the battle" [Ps. 78, 9.), 
that is, he did not believe GOtte, but trusted in his forces. 
This did GOtte against Sihon and Og, against whom he 
drew forth the bow, that is, his war service. Therefore, 
the LORD transferred dominion to Judah from Ephraim. 
In the blessing of Jacob it says [Gen. 49, 24.], "Yet his 
bow remains strong." He wants to say: the dominion of 
Ephraim has many enemies, but it will prevail. Here he 
indicates the whole war service, as in the first book of 
Moshi. Therefore, the simple meaning must remain, 
"bow," that is, warfare. This happened when the king 
Sihon was killed 2c. Then he carried out the war service 
of his people, and waged war through them 2c. And this 
he did, "as he had sworn to the tribes," as he had sworn 
to his people [Ex. 23, 22.]: "I will be the enemy of your 2) 
enemies." This he had often promised [Deut. 3, 2.]: | will 
give Og 3) into your hand, and you shall strike him, as 
[Sihon] the king of the Amorites.

V. 9. 10. You divided the rivers into the land. The 
mountains saw you, and they were afraid. 


He speaks of the division of the Jordan, that is, your 
work in dividing the Jordan. The prophet sees the Lord 
dividing the river, the Jordan. Here he describes the 
passage through the Jordan, which happened after the 
killing of these two kings. You know these personal 
poems. [Ps. 114, 4.:) "The mountains leaped like lambs." 
[Ps. 65, 13.:) "The hills are merry round about." He 
introduces it as if the mountains had heart movements 
like men, therefore because the mountain dwellers bore 
sorrow; or that the mountains leaped, bore sorrow, 
because the whole heart movement is sorrowful. 5) The

bang and is sorry for him", in Hebrew: Suffering birth 
pains. They were in anguish of conscience because the 
LORD broke through the rivers, because [the people] 
could pass through the waters. Who will be able to argue 
against those who have the sea and the waters as a 
way, the rivers passable? The river Jordan ran, but the 
upper part stood like a wall, the lower part flowed into 
the dead sea. This is quite a real poem. Now he 
summarizes it in a summa: 


The depth let itself be heard, the height lifted the 
hands. 


By what? Partly by bearing sorrow or weeping for the 
people in the land, partly by sharing in the joy for the 


Hebrews. 2) Abyssus et altitudo, that is, both the depth 
and the height take part in them]. The hands tend to be

V. 11. Sun and moon stood still. 


He summarizes two works. Famous is the one that 
happened after the crossing of the Jordan, when Joshua 
fought against the king of Zebus 3) and commanded the 
sun to stand still. This history is in Joshua [Cap. 10, 12. 
f.]. It stood still in the time of Joshua. 


Your arrows passed with brilliance. 
This is the other story. When Joshua had defeated 


five or three (SIC!) kings at Makkedah, some fled into a 
cave. As they fled, the Lord sent hail and thunderstorms 
from heaven. He hurled lightnings which killed kings and 
people. Elsewhere the Scripture calls lightnings "arrows" 
[Ps. 144, 6.]: "Let them flash and scatter them", because 
the lightnings are God's arrows. Your arrows went 
shining, or they go. That is, your lightnings run with

great splendor. "Your spears with glances of lightning." 
Read the history in the book of Joshua, chapters 10 and 
11. 


V. 12. You trampled the land in anger. 


[According to the Hebrew it says:] In displeasure you 
walk in the land, in anger you thresh the Gentiles, 
namely Canaan. He comprehendeth all the nations of 
Canaan. Since Joshua had killed the five kings. Now 
follows the last king, Jabin [Jos. 11, 11, who wanted to 
devour Israel. He describes this battle here. Behold how 
he walks in a great majesty of wrath in the land where 
Joshua and the judges are army commanders. "You 
crush," for in this last battle many have been slain. So 
far you have seen all the histories that happened in the 
exodus of Israel until they came to a peaceful dominion 
in the land of Canaan. Then the land was quiet and was 
divided to the twelve tribes. Now follows what works the 
Lord did while the kingdom was quiet. 


V. 13 You went out to help your people, to help your 
anointed. 


"Thou wentest forth," that is, out of the land, with thy 
people and thine anointed, that is, the king that was set 
up against the hostile nations, that thou mightest bring 
victory to thine own. Here he has taken before him the 
histories that happened under the kings, especially 
under David and Saul. He speaks of the wars that were 
waged under the kings of Judah and Israel. "The 
anointed," that is the anointed, the singular for the plural, 
that is, the kings. It describes the glorious victories given 
to them under the kings, the wars they waged going out 
of the land. First the ones they fought going in, now the 
ones they fought going out of their tents. You see that 
the Philistines were defeated under Saul, and other 
kings, namely those of Syria, the Amorites under David. 
"There is David, there is Saul painted." At that time the 
LORD gave victory to Saul, who was godless, for the 
sake of the people; everywhere he saw. The prophet 
had this passage in mind. 


1598 L. XXVIIL, 189-161. 


You crush the head in the house of the wicked. 


Percussisti caput, that is, you smite the head. This is to 
be understood either of Assyria destroyed), or he has put 
"head" for heads, and is speaking of the neighboring 
kings destroyed. This seems to call for the distinction in 
Hebrew that is now had, but | would prefer to understand 
it of the Assyrian. The Hebrew text generally connects 
this piece with the preceding; | would like to connect it 
with the following, but | dare not. Both views can exist, 
that he here, after the victory is given among the kings, 
to speak at the beginning of the attack and the 
disturbance against the king of the Chaldeans. The other 
view is that he speaks of the neighboring kings who were 
destroyed, of the Moabites, the Ammonites, the kings of 
Syria. "Thou destroyest," [thou] namely, the kings of 
Judah and Israel. This sense would exist according to 
the distinction in the Hebrew. Gladly | would like it to be 
understood by the king of Assyria: "You break the head" 
2c. 


Up to the neck. 


This is a harsh image, but powerful and significant. 2) 
Habakkuk sums up a double image that is not repeated 
together like this elsewhere. One is of the princes, that 
they are mountains and foundations; the other, that they 
are the heads. The common people are the body. That 
is, the whole kingdom of the adversaries you have taken 
away, so that the house remains without foundation, and 
the body a trunk without a head. - "To strip away" means 
to destroy the whole building so that the kingdom is 
open; it means that the kingdom is laid waste. To take 
away the head and leave the body as a trunk is to leave 
the people without a head. It is a, picture that the prophet 
himself devised. The "uncovering" is often used of the 
balding of the head and of the captivity of the body.

enemy, where it denotes the taking away of the kingdom 
and the priesthood. So Moses says in his song Deut. 32, 
42 ["over the uncovered head of the enemy"), that means 
to take away the head, that the body remains, that 
means: The head will be taken away from you, and the 
common people will remain scattered. The Jews are like 
an unsteady and scattered body. This is said either of 
the king of the Assyrians, whose kingdom was 
destroyed, or the singular is set for the plural: that the 
kings of Judah and Israel have broken in pieces many 
heads, that is, many kings, and taken away their 
kingdoms. 


V. 14: You wanted to curse the scepter of the head 
with its spots. 3) 


"His scepters," that is, of the Assyrian kingdom, with the 
head of its warriors, that is, with the Babylonian kingdom. 
This the Hebrews distinguish from the preceding. But 
here stands the relative which cannot be separated from 
the preceding, as if here something new begins. 


Nevertheless CJUS follows. This he has now actually 
seen against the king of the Asfyrians. This is a part of 
the rays of the divine light, to have destroyed so many 
nations and kings. And he summarizes with the kingdom 
[of the Assyrians that of the Babylonians’, 1) "With the 
head of its spots." This is said of the land of the 
Chaldeans, to whom the kingdom of the Assyrians had 
already passed. The prophet wants to say: This kingdom 
of the Chaldeans is not yet destroyed, like the other 
kings. Here it is still a threat, because he prays for the 
redemption of the people and for the destruction of the 
king of the Chaldeans. The kingdom has come to be 
under the curse. "You have cursed" by threatening [his 
scepter] through the prophets, which is a part of the 
empire of the Assyrians, that is Babylon. This is what he 
prophesies after praying, because he is sure that he will 
be answered, for the curses that Jeremiah has put 
together-

far we have conquered many, but the Assyrians and the 
Chaldeans will come against us with such a great 
impetuosity to scatter us as other kings have not been 
able to do. 


Which come like a weather. 


It is [in Hebrew] only One expression: to storm a 
storm, as: they will scatter you to scattering. He wants to 
say this: The kings have suffered many things, and we 
have cast down many; but such a man they have not 
known as you are, King of the Chaldeans, who have 
come with a weather, and they have been scattered as it 
were by a storm. About this also thou mockest us. 


And rejoice as if they eat the wretched hidden.

GOD; he rode on his steeds. Now the opposite is true: 
our war service is trodden down, for we are oppressed 
and in the midst of tribulations. Before, in the Red Sea, 
you were our helper, now you rely on us and trample us, 
O Lord, by your horses, by the Chaldeans. Similarly in 
the Psalm "God, help me" 2c. [Ps. 69]. Here it says: Our 
warfare, our horsemen are in the mud, they are nothing.

that water denotes an exceeding great tribulation. So

in the midst of the water, that is, the Chaldeans are 
treading us down. 


V. 16: Because | hear these things.

tells what had happened since they were scattered. Our 
warfare was nothing. When | heard these things, my

Preface to Zephaniah 


This prophet is easy and clear, since he himself indicates 
the cause and the time of his prophecy. Among the minor 
prophets, he prophesies most clearly about the kingdom 
of Christ and does so abundantly and with bright and 
many words. As with all the prophets, his purpose is 1) 
that the kingdom of Judah should be destroyed by the 
Chaldeans, that those who were still in the tribe of Judah 
should be led away into captivity, and that a little bit of 
Judah should nevertheless be revived and preserved for 
the sake of Christ and his exceedingly glorious kingdom, 
which should be born out of Judah; and in Judah his 
kingdom should take its beginning, as the promises say. 
But here is

and content of the same. 


A very great faith is needed to grasp these inconsistent 
sayings of the prophets, who believed that this people 
should be made glorious and preserved, who were led 
away captive from their land to Babylon, who lost their 
homeland, the temple and all worship, where everyone 
despaired. For who could believe in salvation in captivity? 
2c. And with this this prophet is completely involved, who 
prophesied before the time of the Babylonian captivity, 
which is indicated by the title of the prophecy itself, since 
he says that he prophesied in the time of Josiah, the son 
of Amon, king of Judah. For under Zedekiah, who was 
appointed in the place of the sons of Josiah, all the 
people were carried away to Babylon.

. W. VI, 3218-3222. 1607 





[The first chapter. | 


V. 1. This is the word of the Lord that came to 
Zephaniah 2c. 


| do not care about the question of Jerome, since he 
does not only dwell here but also elsewhere with many 
words, namely whether all those whom he lists here as 
forefathers were prophets. And the Hebrews have had 
strange dreams about such things, as their superstition 
is great. | admit that they belonged to the prophetic state. 
For there were three classes among the Jewish people 
(which we have noted above in one place [Amos 1:1]). 
The first class was that of the prophets, the second of 
the priests, the third of the wise men. Jeremiah summed 
them all up [Cap. 18, 18.] For the prophets had their 
order or pens, in which came together those 1) who 
learned from the prophets. Not as if they all had the spirit 
of God, but because they heard the prophets and 
followed them. These the history of the kings calls 
"children of the prophets" [2 Kings 4:1]. 2) 


V. 2. 3. | will take everything out of the land. 


Namely from Judea. He speaks with clear words 
about the Babylonian captivity. But it is strange that he 
says [v. 3.] that he will also gather or snatch away the 
cattle, the birds, and the fish. But this is how he speaks 
in the figure of synecdoche’, as when he says that all 
the Jews were carried away to Babylon, while yet the 
poor remained in the land, as history says. But since the 
greatest part was carried away, therefore he says that 
all were carried away. So he also says here that after the 
people are taken away and the cities in the land are 
burned, the birds and the fish are also taken away. That 
is, there will not be such a great benefit of the fish and 
the birds, 


1) . Handwriting: 6onv6n6rant. The Wittenberg _ better:

2 > ..These - prophets" is missing in the Wittenberg. 


since they, namely the people, are taken away, who 
either sell or buy them. Therefore he speaks of a well- 
ordered kingdom, in which there is a quantity of animals 
and where they are used. This quantity and use ceases 
when the inhabitants of the land are taken away. For 
even the Hebrew verb [XXX] does not actually mean to 
gather, that is, "to gather together," but as the Germans 
say, "to snatch away. Thus it is written in the 28th 3) 
Psalm, v. 3: God, "do not drag me among the wicked". 


Together with the aergernissen and the godless ones. 


The translation of Jerome does not please me as 
much as that of the seventy interpreters who have 
translated in this way: And the offences with the ungodly, 
so that the opinion is: So | will once put an end to all 
offences, that is, to the idolatry and the ungodly services, 
with which they have turned away the people from me, 
who should serve me. 


Yes, | will purge the people from the land. 


Namely from Judah. Thus, right at the beginning of 
the prophecy, he described the whole Babylonian

threats.

Now he declares and describes the aversions of 
which he says that he will take them away from the land. 
And it is the summa of the opinion, as if he wanted to 
say: | will call the king of Babylon here, through whom | 
will exercise my hand, my power and my wrath and show 
it against Judah. 


So | want to spread the rest of Baal. 


This is the one part of the astonishment. Under King 
Josiah, the worship prescribed by the law was not 
violated.

the teaching of the law was pure, as this king was 
exceedingly devoted to godliness, as the books of the 
kings testify, but nevertheless he could by no means 
achieve that he completely eliminated the godless Baal 
service. Always remained with some godless people the 
desire for godlessness and idolatry. And so the godly 
king made it so that idolatry did not prevail, but some 
remnants always remained. Nor can we hope to 
eradicate all ungodliness so completely that all men 
would be pious. For if this could have been done, it would 
certainly have been done by this king, who was most 
zealous about the law and the worship of God. 
Therefore, at that time, the best and largest part of the 
people followed the law, worshipping God with the 
worship prescribed in the law, while many others, who 
were godless, remained in their idolatry. In this way 
Balaam speaks in the fourth book of Moses, 1) when he 
praises the godliness and the right worship in the people 
of Israel, 4 Mos. 23, 21. [Vulg.]: "There is no idol seen in 
Jacob and no graven image in Israel." But Stephen, on 
the other hand, in Acts Cap. 7, 42. f., accuses all the 
fathers of the Jews who passed through the wilderness 
of ungodliness and idolatry, saying, "Did you of the 
house of Israel ever offer me sacrifices and cattle during 
the forty years in the wilderness? And ye took the 
tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan" 
2c. But this is so to unite with each other. The scripture 
is used to speak in the figure of the synecdoche, that it 
takes a part for the whole, the whole for a part, as | also 


said shortly before. And this is called "one (UNUM) key" 
to understand the scripture. 

In addition, the name of the camarim (aedituorum) 
and priests from that place. 

That means that also the name of the Camarim should 
not be there anymore. Because "to take away the name" 
means to make it unknown and unglorious. So it is also 
written here and there in the Psalm [Ps. 9, 6. f. 34, 17.]: 
| will make their 


1) In the manuscript: id Nurrwris; Wittenberger: in 





Take away name under heaven 2c. Thus, nowadays, 
after the Gospel has been revealed by God's grace, the 
name of the Pope has perished, that is, it is not held in 
honor, it is no longer famous. By the way, the same word 


that our Latin interpreter translated by aeditul is also in 
the books of Kings [2 Kings 23:5]. But they were a 
peculiar kind of people, well practiced in this ungodly and 
idolatrous worship, for they have their name from fervent 
and violent devotion. That is why the prophet says here 
explicitly: "The names of the Camarim", as if he wanted 
to say: They were more famous among the people than 
all other priests, they were more respected, and gave the 
people the opinion that they were the most zealous in 
religion and worship before all others. | believe that they 
were just the kind of people who are nowadays monks 
who call themselves friars of the observance. Therefore, 
these godless people were still left under the very godly 
king Josiah. It is impossible for us to sweep out all 
ungodly beings and leaven, but we have to make sure 
that the kingdom of sin does not take place in us, that we 
do not make our members servants of sin, as the apostle 
says [Rom. 6:12 ff]. For this we need the constant use of 
the word, that we always stop, urge, rebuke and punish, 
so that the kingdom of sin does not overcome 2c. 


V. 5 And they that worship from the housetops of 
heaven's host. 


This is another trouble, which the prophet Jeremiah 
often and much reproaches. For he often remembers the 
queen of heaven [Jer. 7, 18. 44, 17. ff.].But they 
worshipped the moon and the stars of heaven, which 
Moses had forbidden in the fifth book [Cap. 17, 3. 4, 19.] 
by a clear law. Therefore, this had been an ancient 
worship and a godless worship, since they had taken the 
beginning of it from the ancestors who had lived in 
Moses' time. But for this godlessness they put on this 
appearance of godliness, namely that they "worshipped" 
the presence of God, which was never to be found in 


1610 L. XXVII, 291-293. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3224-3227. 


1611 





The people of the world have never seen any creature 
more clearly than in the sun, the moon and the stars. 
Then the foolish multitude worshipped not only God 
under the sun or in the sun, but also the sun and the 
moon themselves, as no doubt many of our people, who 
were so fond of idolatry, also worshipped the wooden 
images of the saints. "On the roofs," that is, in a higher 
place, in the open air. For they had flat roofs on which 
they also ate and walked. 


Those who worship it, yet swear by the Lord, and 
at the same time by Malchom. 

Some think that Malchom is the idol of the children of 
Ammon, others want that the king is meant by it, 
because that is what the Hebrew word means. But how 
it is to be translated here, | am not sure; but both 
readings can take place. To swear by the Lord is godly 
and holy, just as to worship the Lord, but the Lord does 
not want us to swear by anyone other than Him alone, 
to worship anyone other than Him alone. He cannot 
suffer us to limp on either side, as the Scripture says [1 
Kings 18:21]. For clearly He says in the law [Deut. 6, 
13.], "Thou shalt worship GOD thy LORD, and serve 
Him alone." And this limping is here punished by the 
prophet. But we serve God no less when we obey the 
authorities according to the will of God, since this 
pleases Him, as Paul says in the Letter to the Romans 
[Cap. 13, 5.]: "Not only for the sake of punishment, but 
also for the sake of conscience." And Solomon 1) says 
[Proverbs 24:21]: Honor the king. But the Jews swore by 
Malchom or by the king, that is, they put their trust in the 
king, which we alone should do against God. For in this 
they were punished by the LORD, because they had 
chosen a king against the LORD, that they put their trust 
in the king, that they would be safer under the king's help 
and protection than under the protection of the LORD. 
They did not entrust themselves to God alone, but put 
their trust in the king, just as the other Gentiles did, as 
the 


1) In the Wittenberg: Peter (Cap. 2, 17.). 





Scripture 1 Sam. 8, 20. clearly testifies: "That we also be 
like all other nations, that our king judge us and go out 
before us when we wage our wars" 2c. So the prophet 
says also here that they have attached to the king the 
honor of swearing, which is due to God alone. But here 
occasion is given for many questions, since we often 
read in Scripture that even the saints swore by the life of 
kings, as [1 Sam. 17, 55.], "As thy soul liveth," 2c., and 
the? Apostle Paul swears [1 Cor. 15, 31.], "By our glory," 
he says, "which | have in JEsu Christ our Lord, | die 
daily," 2c., while yet one should swear by GOD alone and 
serve Him alone. Time does not permit to treat this in 
detail now, it is also not necessary to repeat this in many 
words, since | have explained this in my notes on the fifth 
book of Moses 2) quite abundantly. Although the honor 
and service or servitude is due to God alone, we must 
still submit to the brothers through love, so that one may 
precede the other with reverence, as Paul says in the 
letter to the Romans [Cap. 12, 10.]. But nevertheless this 
servitude is transformed into a service of God, namely 
because for the sake of God one submits to the other in 
this way through love. The difference that separates the 
service of the godly and the godless is in the heart, not 
in external things. Therefore the Jews, whom the prophet 
here accuses of ungodliness, sinned, because they 
swore by the oath without faith. For with the same oath 
the godly swears as the godless, but the latter swears 
with an unbelieving heart, namely, by not giving glory to 
God or standing in fear of him, but the latter swears with 
a believing heart. Thus a godly man uses gold, but he 
does not put his trust in it, as the godless do in creatures 
and the abundance of goods, but recognizes it as a 
creature of God, to whom he attributes everything as 
received from him. But whoever does not like this 
conception of the king, may accept the other one of the 
idol.

V. 6: And they that fall away from the Lord, and ask 
nothing of the Lord, and esteem him not. 


The word, which | translate here by "respect", 1) is also 
in the 14th Psalm, v. 2: "He who asks after God" 2c. 
Therefore the opinion is: | will also gather and destroy all 
the rest of the ungodly, who do not follow the Lord, do 
not keep the law of the Lord, and do not inquire after the 
Lord, who do not make an effort to hear the word of the 
Lord, and after they have heard it, recognize their 
ungodliness and repent. Such people are those, 2) who 
in the parable in the Gospel say [Luc. 14, 19.]: "| have 
bought five yoke of oxen, | have taken a wife, therefore | 
cannot come" 2c. Namely, because they are immersed 
in the lusts and cares of this life and have given 
themselves over to them, they do not care about 
godliness. 


Vv. 7. Be still before the Lord GOD. 


This is an exhortation, as if to say: Since the Lord will 
take you all away like this, be quiet, give place to the 
sermon and the punishment, listen to the word, do not 
contradict 2c. 


For the LORD has prepared a sacrifice. 


The prophet plays with images, as the prophets are wont 
to do, as if he wanted to say: "It is a matter of slaughter. 
The Lord will slaughter a sacrifice for himself, 3) namely 
you, the wicked. 


And invited his guests to it (Et sanctificavit vocatos 
suos). 

That is, he will prepare the Chaldeans, who will be ready to 
devour this sacrifice, who will destroy and disturb you. For these 
the Lord has invited as guests to this his banquet. Thus the 
prophet alludes to the use in sacrifice: when the sacrificial 
animals were slaughtered, then those who were to eat of the 
sacrifice were purified or expiated. Thus says 


1) The preceding words are missing in the Wittenberg. 

2) In the Weimarschen: pjj, cui. But pii is neither in the Erlanger

3) The following words are missing in the Wittenberg. 





Here he does the same, by which he indicates the 
captivity and destruction of the people, namely that the 
Chaldeans were invited by the Lord as guests, who 
should eat this his sacrifice. And so he mocks their 
ungodly sacrifices and offerings, and the outward 
purifications with which they purified themselves when 
they sacrificed, while meanwhile the heart was 
unbelieving and idolatrous 2c. 


V. 8, and on the day of the Lord's sacrifice | will visit 
2c. 


The prophet continues his threat as he began. But 
then we will recognize the intention and the opinion of 
the prophet all the more easily if we consider, on the one 
hand, the fervor and zeal of the prophet, and on the other 
hand, the obduracy and stubbornness of the princes, the 
priests and false prophets, and the godless people, 
against whom the prophet thus flares up, threatening 
them with approaching calamity and the wrath of the 
Lord. For this is the manner of the word, that it contends 
against the mighty, the wise, and the holy. For this is a 
continual strife, as all Scripture indicates. So we see the 
same thing in this passage. The prophet had stiff-necked 
listeners who, filled with false delusion, ridiculed the 
prophet; false teachers who turned the people away from 
the right word of God, who taught the opposite and 
persuaded the rulers otherwise: it would not happen that 
the Lord would destroy his people, his city and his 
temple, of which he had promised that he would be 
present in it. Nor would the king, appointed by God, 
perish, as the prophet threatens here, saying, "And the 
king's children." No one expected that this would ever 
happen, for this kingdom had been established and 
confirmed by GOD through His Word. Then they had the 
very clear promises that had happened to David [1 Kings 
8:25] that he would not lack a son from his loins to sit on 
his throne 2c. Against these exceedingly clear promises 
Zephaniah prophesies here. Therefore the prophecy 
seemed to them impossible and lying. Because they 
cried out against the prophets, as it is 


1614 L. XXVII, 296-298. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3229-3232. 


Jeremiah [Cap. 7, 4J] says: "Here is the temple of the 
LORD, here is the temple of the LORD" 2c. Jerusalem, 
Jerusalem, God's people! and such other words. But 
these are the miraculous works of God, as we have said 
above several times in the other prophets, that He 
deposes the kings whom He has appointed, that He 
causes them to be carried away captive, as Jechaniah 
son of Josiah was carried away to Babylon, and yet He 
has miraculously preserved the kingdom and the kings, 
as He had promised to preserve the same. For even 
though Jechaniah was carried away captive to Babylon, 
even though he was thrown into prison, nevertheless, 
after Nebuchadnezzar died, he was exalted above the 
kings of Babylon, 2c. as sacred history says. Namely, 
God was able to preserve the king in his own way, even 
in the midst of enemies, in the midst of despair, when 
nothing else was in sight but that the kingdom would fall 
and the king would perish. But because this seemed 
impossible to reason and to the godless Jews, they 
easily accused all the prophets of lying. 


Who wear a foreign dress. 


Here the interpreters agonize in many ways. Some 
think that the prophet is here punishing the imitation of 
the idolatrous worship of the pagans, and that the priests 
were also dressed in clothes similar to those of the 
pagan priests. But since this does not fit in with what has 
gone before, nor with what follows, what is the use of 
tearing the prophet's opinion so miserably to pieces? It 
is clear that he is talking about the princes and the king's 
children. Therefore, | believe that the prophet is also 
speaking here of the king's nobles or powerful men, who 
have imitated foreign customs, the dress and habits of 
foreign peoples who were situated all around, and have 
abandoned the paternal customs, habits and dress, as 
nowadays the Germans in general are the apes of all 
nations, since they dress after the manner of all nations, 
soon after that of France, soon after that of Spain. 2c, 
which is the sign of a great frivolity and a fickle mind, as 
it is among the French, and among the Germans 


1615 


who follow the French in this. The poet Ennius was quite 
right: 
Moribus antiquis res stat Romana virisque [By the 


ancient customs and the ancient men the Roman being 
endures]. 


V. 9. Also at the same time | will afflict those who 
leap over the threshold (qui arroganter ingreditur super 
limen). 

The Latin interpreter did not translate clumsily, 
because he had the sense in mind, not the words. For so 
it is written in the Hebrew: He who leaps over the 
threshold at that time. The same word is also in the Song 
of Songs [Cap. 2, 8.], "My friend leapeth upon the 
mountains, and leapeth upon the hills." Here again the 
interpreters seek out something different. For they 
interpret this passage of the priests of Dagon, who did 
not step upon the threshold of the temple of Dagon after 
their idol Dagon was mutilated, as 1 Sam. 5, 4. f. is 
written. But as | said above, | do not have the way to tear 
the prophets apart, as those do, who look for new 
Opinions almost at every single sentence; and with them 
everything hangs quite inconsistently on each other. But 
my opinion is this: As shortly before he had punished the 
godless princes and threatened them with imprisonment, 
likewise the king's children, so here he attacks the 
flatterers and servants of the princes who agree with and 
flatter their lords who act godlessly. For quite 


inconsistently the Latin interpreter has translated it [qui 


complent domum Domini Dei sui iniquitate et doloy, 
while according to the Hebrew it is thus: "Who fill their 
lords' house with robbery and deceit." But he calls them 
knights, that is, all too sure and brazen people, since they 
rely on their lords, whom they try to please by cheating 
the subjects with false measure and false goods, likewise 
unjustly and with obvious violence oppress others, if only 
their lords become rich; as today everywhere in all 
territories of princes and in all courts are the bailiffs and 
stewards, to whom the highest power is given. For they 
rage more and exercise greater violence by extorting and 
oppressing their subjects than 


1616 L. XXVIL, 298-301. interpretation of Zephaniah (1.), cap. 1, 9-11. w. VI, 3232-3234. 


1617 





the princes themselves. These are nothing else than a 
ruin of the whole world, even under good princes, as they 
were also here under the very good king [Josiah] 1). The 
whole world is full of such examples; we need only look 
at all the courts of all princes. 

He says that they "jump over the threshold", that is, they 
are servants, not heirs. They serve only with going out 
and coming in, as those who serve today in the family, 
will be expelled again tomorrow. Namely, this is what 
God intended when He commanded that the servant's 
ear be pierced with an awl, Deut. 15:17. 


V. 10: In that day, saith the LORD, there shall be a 
loud cry from the fish gate. 


How Jerusalem was situated, see in Nehemiah and Ezra. 
Nehemiah described this very carefully. It had two hills: 
a higher one, called Zion, on which was the castle of 
David; a lower one, on which was Mount Moriah, on 
which the patriarch Jacob slept, and on which the temple 
is built. The Fish Gate is the one that lies on the side 
toward the evening, toward the Mediterranean Sea, into 
which all who come by ship to Jerusalem must enter. 
Therefore Jerome says correctly: The fish gate is the one 
that leads to Joppa. Then, as the prophet says: 


And a howl from the other Thor, 


So this is to be understood in this way: There was an 
outer wall in Jerusalem, which also had its houses. 
Within this wall there was another wall, which was called 
"the other part", which is also mentioned in the scriptures, 
as one reads about the prophetess Hulda, that she lived 
in the outer part, as it is written in the second book of 
Kings [Cap. 22, 14]. And from this part they called the 
gate "the other gate". According to this, the hills are the 
innermost part of the city, the castle of Zion and the 
temple, as | said. It is therefore the short epitome of the 
opinion: the whole city will be full of your screaming and 
howling. For it shall be utterly desolate, ye 


1) "Josiah" is in the Wittenberg. 








shall be miserably afflicted and all carried away into 
captivity, so that nothing shall be left. 


V. 11: Hay, you who live in the mill (pilae). 


He gives them the name of the future effect, since he 
calls them inhabitants of the mill. Here the interpreters go 
again extraordinarily apart. Jerome thinks that Jerusalem 


is called a mortar (pilam) from the Hiuabsteigen or from 
the valley Siloah. Likewise Lyra means that it is called so 
from Tiberias, which lies in a valley 2c. | do not hold it 
with them at all. But first it must be remembered that in 
our reading there is an ambiguity, since we read 


habitatores pilae. One must be careful, however, that 
we do not introduce an ambiguity in the translation, 


which, as we see, has happened here. But pila does not 
mean a ball with which one is wont to play, but a mortar, 
oOAuOG, as Jerome translated. Hence this image of the 
prophet is taken from the use of a mortar, and the opinion 
is, So great will be the calamity and the crushing in this 
city, that, just as in vain mortar herbs and other things 
which we pound are turned to dust, so also Jerusalem 
will become to you like a mortar, in which you will be 
pounded and turned to nothing. Or if anyone does not like 
this opinion, let him follow the other which Solomon gives 
in Proverbs [Cap. 27, 22.], "If you pound the fool in the 
mortar,” 2c., so that the opinion would be, Jerusalem is 
as it were a mortar of the LORD, in which the LORD 
pounds you by the prophets whom he sends to reprove 
and punish you, but he adjusts nothing. For as much as 
you are daily crushed, yet foolishness does not depart 
from you. Therefore, he will crush you once through the 
king of Babylon, as he adds: 


For all the merchant peop are gone (Quoniam 
conticuit omnis populus Chanaan). 

This word is frequent in the minor prophets, therefore one 
must pay attention to it, since they often speak of silence, 
of being still. 


4648 L. xxvn, 3oi-3ot. Interpretations on the prophets. W. vi, 3234-3237. 


4619 





But it means "to be silent": to be made to nothing, and so 
the prophets do not indicate both the silence of the 
mouth and that of the things, namely that there is no 
more use of the things, everything lies down and is not 
respected, but despised, as we said above [v. 3] at the 
beginning of this prophet about the "raffle away" of the 


fish and birds. Then, since he says Chanaan, it is 
uncertain whether this word has an appellative meaning 
or is a proper name. Appellatively it means a merchant. 
But there is no doubt that the prophet understood 
Canaan to mean the Jews. It therefore remains the 
image [which indicates] why he calls them so. Now if it is 
an appellative word, the prophet is punishing the avarice 
and wicked artifices of the merchants of Judea, by which 
they obtained goods by defrauding other people. But if it 
is a proper name, this seems to me to be the opinion, as 
if he wanted to say: Furthermore, you are now no longer 
Judah, but Canaan, since the Lord will not act differently 
with you, as with the Cananites, who have all been driven 
out of the country and destroyed. This conception fills me 
best. In a similar way Ezekiel speaks [Cap. 16, 3.], "Thy 
father is of the Amorites, and thy mother of the Hittites." 
And Daniel says [History of Susanna, v. 56.], "Thou 
Canaanite kind, and not Judah." 


And all those who collect money are wiped out. 


That is, the rich who are miserly and glowing with 
greed. 


V. 12: At that time | will search Jerusalem with 
lanterns. 


He goes on to make this pounding great, as if to say, 
"So great will be the disturbance, so carefully will | 
search all the innermost and most hidden places in 
Jerusalem, that none may escape my wrath. All of them 
| will pound in this mortar, from which they will not 
escape. But one who is in a mortar will not easily escape, 
as it is commonly said, "He is so clever that you would 
not want to hit his head in the mortar." 





And wants to haunt the people who lie on their 
heels. 


That is, those who have become immobile, rigid, 
resting on their heels. This is a prophetic image of this 
prophet. This passage can also be understood in two 
ways. First, in an ignominious manner and with an 
exceedingly contemptuous word, he calls their 
righteousnesses and false beliefs "yeasts," with which 
they defile themselves by trusting in them, and turn the 
right word of God and the promises 1) into the most 
hideous delusion, which they have invented, while they, 
being sure, do not hear the prophets who threaten them 
with destruction, but defend their godlessness and 
protect their error by false and foolish opinions which 
they have learned from the false prophets. The other 
view is this: just as the yeast is the last thing in the 
vessel, so also this people is the last thing, very close to 
destruction, captivity is imminent for them. So also Isaiah 
Cap. 7, 4. calls the two kings "two smoking extinguishing 
fires", as if he wanted to say: there is nothing of strength 
left in them, soon they will be completely extinguished, 
since they are only smoking. Thus, because these 
prophetic images are uncertain and ambiguous, we 
cannot determine anything certain about the opinion. But 
| like the first view better, of their teachings or opinions, 
with which they protect their errors, so that they do not 
hear the prophets, since the following passage explains 
the same. 


And say in their heart, The LORD will do neither 
good nor evil. 


As if he wanted to say: | am not regarded differently 
among them, as if | were a nonsense or a Thor. For they 
do not believe that | speak of the true God when | 
threaten them with God's wrath, therefore they mock and 
deride me. For they boast of the promises made by God 
to the fathers, that they should be preserved, of the 
everlasting kingdom, of the lasting possession of the 
land 2c. But me, because | prophesy against these their 
Opinions,

W. VI, 3237-3239. 1621 





They laugh at me together with my God, whom | praise 
and whose wrath | preach, saying, "Our God has 
promised us salvation and the kingdom, but you threaten 
destruction and captivity from your God. Away with you, 
you 1) stay with your god. The evil you threaten us with 
will not happen. "Your God will leave us in peace," since 
our God protects and preserves us, as He has promised 
2c. Namely, this is the right opinion of this passage. Let 
no one think that the Jews were so nonsensical as to 
deny that God takes care of everything 2c., but they 
denied that this God is the true God of whom Zephaniah 
said that He threatens them with calamity 2c. So also 
today they deny that this is the true Christ and the Gospel 
of Christ that we preach. 


V. 13. And their goods shall become plunder. 
He now describes the visitation with which he will afflict 
the people who lie on their heels, of whom he had just 
said, namely that all theirs will come to ruin. Because the 


prophet calls at this place "their strength" (fortitudinem) 
their fortune, their property and their wealth. 


They will build houses. 

That is, they sit securely, not even thinking that such a 
thing will happen, however much | shout about the future 
disturbance. For the more | threaten them with judgment 
and wrath, the more nonsensical they become. 
Therefore, they are safe, fear nothing for themselves, 
rmd build houses, plant as if they want to stay on earth 
forever; me they accuse of lying 2c. Therefore, 
misfortune will overtake them unawares. So also Christ 
says [Luc. 17, 27. f.],it will happen that men will build, 
plant, take wives before the day of judgment 2c. And 
Paul [1 Thess. 5, 3.]: "For when they shall say, There is 
peace, there is no danger, then destruction shall quickly 
overtake them" 2c. For so it always happens and

has happened in such a way that when very great and 
powerful kingdoms have grown to the highest, the 
disturbance and downfall has immediately followed. For 
this is God's play in human affairs, as also the prophet 
says in the Psalm [Ps. 73, 18]: You have made a 
mockery of them, you have overthrown them when they 
were set on the slippery slope. 2) Almost all poets' 
writings are full of this. Thus that poet has said very 
finely: What is great will not last long. 3) 


V. 14: For the great day of the Lord is near. 


Always the prophet urges with so many words and so 
much vehemence the future calamity against the hopeful 
and sure despisers who accused the prophet of lying, 
who said that the Lord would not do them evil 2c. For, as 
we have said, they were sure and feared nothing for 
themselves, being strengthened by a false conviction. 
But so it is with the wicked: when they are most 
flourishing and ruling, when nothing less is seen than 
that they will perish, then a sudden destruction comes 
upon them. For, as the prophet says in the Psalm [Ps. 
55:24], the wicked will not bring their life to the half, as 
also Christ says in the Gospel parable [Luc. 12:46] of 
your unrighteous servant, that the Lord will come then, 
because that servant does not understand. For because 
they remain obstinate, they are not moved by the threats 
of God; therefore, destruction comes upon them 
suddenly and unawares. For human nature cannot be 
inflated other than by prosperity, and cannot solve the 
riddle of how far the highest misfortune is from the 
highest happiness, as one is wont to say. For it cannot 
fear misfortune in prosperity 2c. The prophet says the 
same thing here, as if to say: You have good confidence 
in this your prosperity, but do not think that the Lord will 
deceive you when he foretells your captivity, for it is 
already before you.

1622 L. XXVH, 306-308. interpretations on the prophets 


_W. VI, 3239-3242. 1623 





When the cry of the Day of the Lord will come. 


That is, those who cry out and suffer in the day of the 
Lord. He presents the calamity as if it were already 
present. For he pictures the people in captivity, the 
houses destroyed, that the people howl, cry out and 
weep miserably. For he calls the great day of the Lord 
the day of the Babylonian captivity, not the last day, as 
Jerome thinks, who, in his way, attributes a special 
opinion to almost every single sentence of the prophets. 


Then the strong will cry out bitterly. 


| do not fully understand the Hebrew word which the 
prophet has used here. Because the Latin interpreter has 
passed over the letter n in haste and has meant, it is an 
n. The newer linguists say this word means: shout loudly. 
The newer linguists say that this word means: to shout 
loudly. Because we have nothing better, also nothing 
else can determine about the' meaning of the word, we 
want to follow them. For these newer grammarians have 
also been more careful, and still are, in comparing the 
places in the language when such a special word occurs, 
than the ancients were. Accordingly | translate after the 
Hebrew thus: There the strong shall cry out fiercely, so 
that the singular stands for the plural, that is: The brave 
warriors, who before were an object of fear to all in the 
people, all the strongest shall cry out more, shall fear 
more than the rest of the common people 2c. 


V. 15. For this day is a day of wrath. 


This passage has been frequently used in all churches, 
namely when the mass priests suck soul masses, and 
they have drawn it to the day of the last judgment. But 
here we see quite obviously that they have twisted it quite 
inconsistently, because the prophet speaks of the 
Babylonian captivity. But what we read [in the Vulgate]: 


dies calamitatis [instead of: "a day of weather’, is badly 
translated from the Hebrew. It 


should have been translated in the same way as the 
evangelist Lucas Cap. 21, 25: "The sea and the waves 
shall roar," and as it is said in the Proverbs of Solomon 
[Cap. 3, 25]: "That thou fear not the sudden terror, nor 
the tempest of the wicked," and Ps. 65, 8: "Thou that 
stillest the roaring of the sea, the roaring of its waves." 
Hence it should have been translated thus, "a day of 
weather and tempest." But the prophet indicates that the 
Babylonians will come with a very great tempest and will 
rage against the Jews, not unlike when the sea, stirred 
up by violent winds, is wont to roar and make a noise. 


A day of darkness and gloom. 


The prophet imagines a storm by which he indicates 
and describes the extremely violent and heated attack of 
the Chaldeans, namely the Jews would not be able to 
resist in any way, they would have to perish. 


V. 16. A day of trumpets and drums. 


Namely, the Chaldeans, as if the Chaldeans, certain 
of victory, would shout and rejoice, so that you could 
already die by the so terrifying and great roar. 


Against the solid cities and high castles. 


That is, the Lord will bring the army of the Chaldeans 
against you so that you will be destroyed and led away 
into captivity. You will not be able to resist, for even your 
strongest cities will not be of any use to you, not even 
Jerusalem, nor will any defense, however strong, nor any 
fortification be so great that you will be able to withstand 
them. There is no counsel, no wisdom, no strength 
against the Lord. 


V. 17. | will make people anxious. 
| do not understand this Hebrew word either. Because 


it does not mean "plague" (tribulare), as our Latin 
interpreter translates it. | give it in such a way: And | will 
trumpet among the people, "I will also let myself be 
heard. | will raise a shout among you," that is, | will strike 
fear into your hearts. 





1624 L. xxvii, 308-3H. Interpretation of Zephaniah (I), Cap. I, 17, 18. w. vi, 3212-3245. 


1625 





that you may know that | am waging war, that | am 
fighting against you. For this is how God wages war, to 
take away the heart and courage of those whom He 
wants to destroy, as | have reminded you several times 
above in the other prophets. For so it comes to pass that 
they are quite easily, without any effort on the part of the 
enemy, even put to flight by a leaf of a tree. For then they 
fight quite unhappily. And this opinion he expresses, 
since he adds: 


That they should walk around like the blind. 


As if he wanted to say: Through this despondency of 
the hearts | will cause them to be deprived of all counsel. 
They will not be able to come to themselves again; in 
their consternation they will not know at all whether they 
want to flee or resist the enemy or make peace 
proposals. They will be as confused and helpless as the 
blind. 


Because they have sinned against the Lord. 


Everything fits very well to my view. For he gives here 
the reason for the preceding, as if he wanted to say: | 
will make them feel their sins; this feeling or revelation 
of sin in their hearts will make them ashamed. For now 
they do not recognize their sin, but rather they defend 
their sin, with which they have sinned against the Lord. 
But then there will be no remedy, they will become 
powerless in their sins 2c. 


Their blood shall be shed as if it were dust (sicut 
humus). 


It is not to be read: fumus [smoke]. For the Hebrew 
word means excavated earth, which can be scattered 
like ashes or dust, from which also the first man Adam 
was created, and therefore it is often translated by dust, 
as [Gen. 3, 19. Vulg.]: Remember, man, "that thou art 
dust, and shalt return to dust". 


And her body as if it were dung. 


According to the Hebrew | read most correctly so: 
And their bread as if it were dung. Furthermore, it is a 
Hebrew way to speak, because with 





the name Brod is used by the Hebrews to refer to food 
or nourishment. Therefore it should have been 
translated like this: And their food, as if it were dung. 
Thus Paul spoke of his legal righteousness in the letter 
to the Philippians Cap. 3, 8: "I count all things as dung." 
Perhaps Paul was looking at this passage of the 
prophet. It is therefore the opinion: although they will 
endeavor to propitiate GOD with flesh and blood, 
namely with that of the sacrificed animals; as much as 
they want to sacrifice to the LORD, still their sacrifices 
will not be pleasing. The enemies will come and scatter 
all the sacrifices, their blood and their bread, like dust. 
Thus in the third book of Moses we often find that the 
sacrifices are called meat, because they were given to 
the priests. In general, the Hebrew word [XXXX] denotes 


what the Latin expresses by the general word @SCa 


[food]. But also the evangelists followed the Hebrew 
way of speaking and translated it by the word bread. In 
a similar way Hosea spoke on this opinion, above Cap. 
9, 4.: Their bread is the bread of the afflicted, and Israel 
eats that which is unclean 2c., that is, their sacrifices are 
in mourning; these the LORD does not want. For this 
was forbidden in the law, see Deut. 26:14. This passage 
is extremely noteworthy, for it rejects all righteousness 
of the flesh and calls it dung, as the apostle Paul also 
calls it. Therefore, he indicates that nothing is required 
for true righteousness but faith in the Word of God. 


v.18. Their silver and gold will not save them. 


He says that everything will be of no use to them. 
First of all, he rejects their righteousness, their worship, 
their sacrifices, and says that they will not be pleasing to 
the Lord, that he should deliver them [therefore] from the 
enemies, because everything will be considered dung. 
They themselves also will feel in their consciences sin 
against the LORD, so that they must despair. And so the 
temptation will teach them to know the word, as Isaiah 
says [Cap. 28, 19]. He also adds this, that they will not 
find help in outward things either for 


1626 L. XXVIIL, 311-313. Interpretations On the Prophets. 


W. VI, 3245-3248. 1627 





This misfortune is wealth, gold and silver, that is, they 
will not be able to redeem themselves with gold or silver, 
so that they will not be killed or taken into captivity, 
because the Chaldeans will either kill them all or take 
them away. 


But the whole land shall be consumed by the fire of 
his zeal. 


This means that the anger of the Lord that has been 
kindled cannot be mitigated. The Lord 





will not allow the Chaldeans to accept gold or silver to 
buy themselves off, as they usually do in wars. 
Therefore, there is nothing left but for the whole land of 
Judah to be consumed by the fire of the Lord's zeal. For 
it will suddenly come to an end with all who dwell in the 
land, so that they cannot be delivered from this 
Babylonian captivity either by their righteousness or by 
a ransom 2c. 


The second chapter. 


In the previous chapter we saw the prophetic threat 
of the future Babylonian captivity. Now, 1) after the 
threat of disaster (as is the custom with all prophets), he 
exhorts to repentance, if they could be hidden in any way 
on the day of the Lord's wrath, that they might propitiate 
the Lord by public preaching and prayer, so that, if the 
whole nation should be destroyed, yet a few remnant 
might be preserved 2c. And this is the summa of this 
chapter. 


V. 1. Gather yourselves together and come here. 


In Hebrew, these two verba are almost one and the 
same word. In German we would give it correctly like 
this: "Gather yourselves and come here." 


Your hostile people (gens non amabilis). 


That is, "you hostile people," who are worthy of hatred 
and not of love. 


V. 2: Before the judgment (jussio) goes out. 


In the Latin Bible one still added et V1S10, but it was 
put into the text by a klUgling what was noted by another 
to indicate a different reading. But nevertheless the 
Hebrew word means neither a command nor a face, but 
a decision, 


1) Wittenberger: Non statt: Nuno. 


a judgment, something fixed, as in the 2nd Psalm, v. 6. 
f.: "But | have set my king upon my holy mountain Zion. 


| will preach of such a manner (praeceptum)," where in 
Hebrew is quite the same word. And Moses generally 
uses this word for ceremonial laws, as we also noted 
above in another place. It is therefore the short epitome 
of this saying: "The judgment against you is already 
determined and passed. The only thing that remains is 
that it has not yet gone out, that is, that it will be fulfilled; 
the exercise of the threat still remains. 


That you, like the chaff by day, pass by. 


The Hebrews make themselves’ at this place big 
difficulties, and think it is a speech in which something is 


omitted (eclipticam). | hold that this is done without 
necessity, and read and understand it simply as follows: 
Before the judgment brings forth the day, which will be 
like the passing dust, that is, violently swept away as by 
a whirlwind. This way of speaking is frequent in 
Scripture. Ps. 1:4: "Like chaff scattered by the wind." 
Likewise Job 21:18: "They shall be as stubble which the 
whirlwind leadeth away." Therefore the opinion is: You 
will be scattered in that day as stubble or dust is 
scattered by the violence of the winds and the 
impetuosity of a storm. 


1628 L. XXVII, 313-316. interpretation of Zephaniah (1.), Cap. 2, 2-4. 


Before the day of the Lord's wrath comes upon you. 


In Hebrew there is a negation: Before the day does 
not come; but this is the way of the Hebrew language, 
that it sometimes expresses the affirmation by the 
negation. By the way, in our Latin Bible the word diss 
‘the day] is omitted. For so it must be read, "Before the 
day of the Lord's wrath come upon you." 


V. 3. Seek the Lord. 


That is, see that you do not come together in vain, 
that your assembly is not in vain, but by prayer and 
preaching one calls another to repentance, you who are 
the wretched of the land. | translate the Hebrew word for 


mansueti: "miserable," lowly, oppressed, rejected 
before the world, to whom not many pay attention, who 


are not spoken of (agatol), who are without honor and 


riches. So also Christ came as a meek (mansuetus) 
king, as Matthew [Cap. 21, 5.] indicates from Zechariah 
[Cap. 9, 9.], that is, lowly, in no royal armor, pomp and 
glory, in whom everything appears quite contemptible 
2c. So also Mary sings of herself in her song [Luc. 1, 
48.], "For he hath regarded the lowliness (or lowly 
nature) of his handmaid." 


Who you hold his rights. 

That is, if there are still some among you who care 
about godliness and the word of God, who ask for the 
Lord, who are humble, they should seek the Lord if he 
can be reconciled to them in some way, so that at least 
these very few will be preserved, while almost all the rest 
of the people perish. 


Seek righteousness, seek humility. 


This is how it must be read according to the Hebrew. 
This prophet urges humility before all others. For he 
knows that the humble please God, but the proud, the 
hopeful and the hardened despisers do not. 


That ye may be hid in the day of the LORD's wrath. 


That is, whether you could be protected in any way 
that you would not be protected by the 


W. VI, 3248-3251. 1629 


the wrath of the Lord that is to come. For the prophet is 
not saying that the captivity he has threatened can be 
revoked, but he commands them to pray to the Lord to 
protect and preserve them until his fierce wrath passes, 
so that they will not perish at the same time as the 
others. Job also prays in this way, Cap. 14, 13: "Oh that 
you would harden me until your wrath subsides. 


Vv. 4. For Gaza must be abandoned. 


He makes here a conclusion from the strength of 
Gaza and other cities, whose ruin and complete 
destruction he will threaten here. For it was a miracle, 
and is still with me an immense miracle, that the so small 
nation of the Philistines, so few people that they had only 
five cities, could always resist the Jews most fiercely, 
and to such an extent that they could never be 
conquered under any king and _ subdue Israel 
completely, than only under David. It is therefore the 
opinion of the prophet: You tribe of Judah and Benjamin 
are still left after Israel has been carried away and 
perished; now your calamity is also coming, there is also 
before you tremendous and severe captivity, which will 
be so great that it will destroy not only you, but also all 
the neighboring nations, however strong they may be. 
But the Latin interpreter has not been able to render the 
dainty word play, which is in the Hebrew. Because Gaza 
means the strength. And it is the opinion: Gaza, which is 
strong and powerful, will be abandoned and Ascalon will 
become desolate. 


Asdod is to be expelled at noon. 

Since | do not have a different opinion here, | follow 
Jerome's, although | have doubts about it: They will drive 
it out at midday, that is, in open combat, without all 
artifice, without all guile. 


And acaron be rooted out. 


Also here he alludes to the name, as if he wanted to 
say: aS your name is, so you will experience it in fact. 
"You will become a right" Auswnrzelnng "2c. 


1630 L XXVIL, 316-318. Interpretations On the Prophets. W. VI, 32SI-3254. 


1631 





V. 5: Woe to those who live by the sea (funiculum 
maris), the warriors. 
This is a Hebrew way of speaking, because "the cord" 


(funiculus) means dividing and measuring, as can be 
seen in Joshua [Cap. 17, 5. 19, 9J, where he writes that 
with twelve cords the land was divided. And Moses says 
[Deut. 32, 9]: "Jacob is the cord of the Lord." Therefore 
"the cord" is a part or the allotted part. So here he calls 
the Philistines the cord of the sea, that is, those who were 
situated on the shore of the sea. For they dwelt on the 
midland sea; hence the port of Joppa is still famous 
today. 


The warriors (gens perditorum). 
This is again a Hebrew way of speaking; that is, the 
people who are to be corrupted or exterminated. Those 
speak foolishly who say that by this the Cretans are 
designated. 


The word of the Lord will come upon you. Du 
Canaan. 


On this side of the Jordan were the Cananites. There 
also dwelt the Philistines, whom he here threatens with 
destruction and so great an annihilation that there would 
be none to inhabit their land. 


V. 6. There shall be shepherds’ houses and flocks 
of sheep down by the sea. 


It is the same word that was translated above in Joel 
[Cap. 1, 19.] and Amos [Cap. 1, 2.]: "the meadows in the 


desert" (speciosa deserti), of which we said there that it 
had an appellative meaning. Therefore it is more 
correctly translated: the dwellings in the desert. Hence 
the opinion is: The people of the Philistines have hitherto 
always been invincible 1), they could never be 
conquered by the Jews, they rather resisted them most 
fiercely; but now their end is imminent, they will be so 
disturbed that no inhabitants will remain of them; 
everything will become desolate. For never after the 
Babylonian captivity have they been restored, nor the 
rest of the neighboring nations. For they are so wonderful 


1) Wittenberger: injustn instead of: invietu. 


scattered and plagued in many ways that they never 
returned to their place. 

Now they are called by the common name Arabs, a 
kind of people brought together from all these nations, 
but who have lost their former names. And these most 
noble cities of the Philistines are so completely 
destroyed and razed to the ground that they could never 
be rebuilt. There are only remains of ruins to be seen, 
like heaps of stones, as Jerome often remembers him 
who saw them. After that now follows this: 


V. 7 And the same shall be given unto the remnant 
of the house of Judah, that they may feed thereon. In 
the evening they shall lie down in the houses of 
Ascalon. 


That is, everywhere will be only sheep hurdles. So 
great will be the disturbance of the Philistines that when 
the Jews return from Babylon, they will not find even a 
semblance of their former strength, power and splendor. 
They will only find hurdles into which they can bring their 
sheep from pasture in the evening. 


Now when the LORD their GOD has afflicted them 
again. 

That is, they will return from captivity one day, the 
Lord will redeem them, the captivity will not last forever. 
So the prophets everywhere are careful not to reject the 
people of Judah completely, as if they should never be 
restored. For as much as they emphasize the captivity 
and the future [calamity] 2) against it, they have always 
fixed their eyes firmly on the future kingdom of Christ, 
which they knew would come forth from this people, as 
the promises read, and as we have said above several 
times in many words; therefore, if not all, yet a few had 
to be preserved. Thus, according to God's counsel, 
many were brought back from Babylon to the land, and 
Jechaniah was preserved in prison by God's miraculous 
counsel, since-

so that the lamp [Pf. 132, 17] of the house of Jacob would 
not be extinguished, as the promise [1 Kings 2, 4.2 Sam. 
7, 11. ff. 16.] reads. 


V. 8. | have heard the reproach of Moab and the 
blasphemy of the children of Ammon. 


Now the prophet turns his face toward the morning 
and threatens the Moabites and Ammonites with 
destruction, as well as the Moors, as follows [v. 12]. It is 
well known that these two nations have always been very 
hostile to the Jews. They always persecuted the Jews 
with the bitterest hatred wherever they could, they always 
sat down against them and harmed them. Then they 
wished for happiness and rejoiced when something bad 
happened to God's people, they mocked the wretched 
when they were led away into captivity, they shouted to 
their enemies that they should exterminate them, that 
they should kill them all, as can be seen from the Psalm: 
"Lord, remember the children of Edom in the day of 
Jerusalem, who say, Clean off, clean off, even to their 
ground." And as Jeremiah says [Klaglieder 2, 15.], "Is this 
the holy city?" 2c., that is, this is indeed the land of Judea, 
the people of GOD, to whom up to now uiemand could 
be incumbent; now, of course, it is about the same. Thus 
he says here completely the same, what above Amos 
also said. 


And on the same borders have boasted. 


That is, they have boasted with full cheeks, with great 
words; they thought it was done for my people. But they 
shall not escape, they shall perish utterly. Only hold out 
my hand, do not despair. 


Vv. 9. 2) Moab shall become like Sodom. 


It is true that it did not perish in quite the same way 
as Sodom, and became quite like it, but so almost in all 
the prophets the fall of Sodom is taken as an example, 
as, in Jeremiah [Cap. 23, 14.]: "They have become like 
Sodom and Gomorrah." And Isaiah says [Cap. 1, 9.]: "If 
the Lord had not left us a little, we would be 


1) Wittenberger: vavia. 
2) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 





like Sodom and equal to Gomorrah." It is therefore the 
opinion of the prophet: The destruction of the Moabites 
will be so great that nothing will remain unharmed to 
them. Everything will be destroyed, "that they may bring 
nothing at all of it." For all these neighboring nations are 
so scattered and destroyed by the Romans, Persians 
2c., that they have not even kept the old name, as | said 
just before; all are merged into One People. 


Yes, like a nettle bush and salt pit. 


Meaning. Places or sites that are salty, as it says in 
another place [Ps. 107, 34.]: Who turns the fertile land 
into a salty one. In short, the Lord will make everything a 
barren land, so that nothing but nettles and thorns will 
grow in the land; the ground will be barren. 


And the rest of my people shall rob them. 


Namely, those who will return from the Babylonian 
captivity. For they will be made so completely nothing 
that those who were the strongest nations until now will 
be swept away by the few remaining of my people, 
whereas before the whole nation was never able to 
conquer them completely. But they did not take the 
whole empire from them, but here and there some cities. 
For also the Persians, the Egyptians and the Romans 
have torn away from it. That is why Jerome is torturing 
himself extraordinarily at this point, as is his way 2c. 


V. 11.5 let all the islands of the Gentiles worship, 
each in its own place. 


That is, after the return from the Babylonian captivity, 
the Lord will make the temple in Jerusalem more famous 
than it was in the time of Solomon, when several kings 
offered gifts, but the worship of God and the service of 
God never became so well known, never spread to other 
nations as it did when they returned from Babylon, as 
Lucas also indicates in the Acts of the Apostles, when 
he says [Cap.2, 5.]: "Now there were Jews

1635 





dwelling at Jerusalem, out of all the people which are 
under heaven". For this was, as it were, a prelude to the 
future kingdom of Christ, which was not to be spread 
among the Jews, but into the whole world, among all 
nations. For afterwards, through the apostles, this 
kingdom was confirmed and spread, which at that time 
shone almost everywhere, even among the Gentiles. 
And therefore Christ caused that everywhere in the 
world God was worshipped, not only in Jerusalem, but 
among all nations. This is what the prophet says here 
about the service of God being spread also among all 
the Gentiles: The isles among the Gentiles will worship 
him, that is, they will bring their gifts to the temple in 
Jerusalem, the Gentiles will also testify that this is the 
service of the true God 2c. 


V. 12. Also, you Moors shall be slain by my sword. 


Namely by the sword which the Babylonian king will 
wield. Now the prophet has turned against noon and also 
threatens the destruction of the Moors, so that he seems 
to want completely the same or to preach in the same 
order or manner as Jeremiah, since he was commanded 
by the Lord that he should pour out of the cup full of 
wrath from the Lord to all nations [Jer. 25, 15], as if 
Jeremiah wanted to say: If the Lord does not spare the 
people of Israel, which he has chosen for himself, he will 
spare much less of the other neighboring nations, which 
are not of the people of God. The prophet Zephaniah 
does the same here. For he subjects all the Gentiles to 
the wrath of God and to captivity, so that they will not 
think that only the people of God deserve captivity. But 
still the Lord begins first with His own, as Peter says 1 
Petr. 4, 17: "For it is time that judgment should begin on 
the house of God. But so first on us, what end will it come 
to those who do not believe the gospel of GOD?" For 
first, after the word of God is sent forth, he crucifies his 
martyrs and preachers of the word, and causes his 
people to suffer much; then, when the godly have been 
afflicted for a little while 


If they are not, the terrible wrath of God and the 
punishment against the enemies of the Word and the 
people of God will come immediately, which we also 
experience today. 


V. 13. 1) He will make Nineveh desolate, arid like a 
desert (Et ponet speciosam in solitudinem). 


Of this word | have also said above [Jonah Cap. 4, § 
19], namely that it means in appellative meaning "the 


beautiful one" (speciosa). But here it is a proper name 
and not an appellative, therefore instead of speciosam 


18 to be translated: "Nineveh". Then there is great 
confusion in what follows. But | read according to the 
Hebrew thus: and the multitude of the ships like a desert. 
The Hebrew word also means impassable or without 
water. But how can the impassable become a desert, 
since it is this already before? Therefore, this 
inconsistency moves me to translate in this way. 
Therefore the opinion is: | want to make Nineveh 
desolate, and where the quantity of the ships is, that is, 
the sea cities which are at the rivers or near the sea, 
which are famous by her trade, | want to make to nothing. 


V. 14: That all kinds of beasts among the Gentiles 
will be encamped inside. 


Animals of every kind of this people, that is, of this 
region, of which | speak now; not of all heathens, as our 
Latin interpreter translates. As if he wanted to say: After 
the people are killed and the cities devastated, these 
places will be nothing but pastures for animals of every 
kind, both tame and wild, after all inhabitants are gone. 
In fact, everything will become a wasteland. 


Bitterns and hedgehogs will also live on their 
towers. 


Up to the today's day is disputed among the Hebrew 
grammarians about the words which signify things, as 
also great people have disputed about this. Because 
now the Hebrew language has fallen to a large extent, so 
that over many words nothing certain can be determined, 
we follow

this uncertain light, since we cannot find something else 


that would be better. But Onocrotalus ["Bittern"] is a 
well-known bird in the Latin language. It sticks its beak 
into the water and makes a strong sound. He is not 
tamed, and people have no use for him 2c. 


And will sing in the windows (vox cantantis). 


If | were allowed, | would also say here that there is a 
particular name of a bird, where our interpreter 


translates: cantantis [of the singing], and | would 
translate it by crow or by a word that denotes another 
bird that makes bright sounds. But because | have no 
other example, | dare not assert it. According to the 
derivation of the word, it is translated correctly when it is 


given by cantantis, but there are many such words in 
this language, which, although they seem to be generic 
names, are nevertheless proper names. Thus | could 
also have given beforehand the word which the 


interpreter translated by onocrotalus by eater, for the 
derivation of the word would allow this. For Pliny writes 
of the bittern, 1) that it gathers many things into its gullet, 
where, as he says, a special kind of head is located. 
After the devoured is gradually ruminated, she brings it 
into the stomach 2c. But if one reads it appellatively with 
the Latin interpreter, this will be the opinion, as if he 
wanted to say: Quite certainly the night owls and other 
wild birds will howl there in the windows, while before 
there young boys and girls used to sing 2c. 


1) The Wittenberger continues: The bitterns have similarity with 
the swans, and one would not think that there would be a difference 
between the two, if they did not have a special kind of gullet in the 
gullet. The insatiable animal gobbles everything into it, so that there 
is an extraordinary space for the grimace. Soon after the predation is 
completed, the food is gradually brought back into the beak, and the 
bird brings it into the right stomach in the manner of your ruminant. 
But 2c. 


This whole passage should have been understood 
rather from Babylon than from Nineveh, since Nineveh 
was already devastated and the kingdom was brought to 
the Babylonians. Therefore | hold thus: that the kingdom 
of the Chaldeans and the Assyrians had been almost 
one kingdom, and that only one area had been, but that 
there had been different kings, who also lived in different 
places, as each one liked, as also different kings of Israel 
stayed in different cities, as the holy histories indicate. 
Therefore he calls here the kingdom, which was already 
transferred to the Babylonia), - this kingdom, | say, he 
calls by the old name Nineveh, which was the largest 
and most distinguished city of this kingdom, or the 
capital of the kingdom. Such change of the names has 
the Scripture also often with kings rc. 3) 


V. 15. This is the joyful city (civitas gloriosa), 


The prophet mocks them by punishing the pride and 
arrogance or presumption of the kingdom, as if to say: Is 
this then the city of Nineveh in the most powerful 
kingdom, which boasted so highly of its power and 
troops, wealth 2c? For this is the meaning of the Hebrew 


word, which the interpreter translated by gloriosa, as we 


call a glorious man of war (gloriosum militem), - not 
the one who has fame, whom people admire because of 
his bravery, - but the one who boasts himself 2c. As then 
the prophet also adds here: "It is |, and none more." 


How has it become so desolate that the animals live 
inside! 
That is, how deserted it has become, made into a 


wasteland! Having been the seat of the king before, it 
has now become the camp of cattle and beasts of prey.

The third chapter. 


This third chapter prophesies 1) about the city of 
Jerusalem and the people of God, who lived in 
Jerusalem after the return from the captivity, after the 
rulers, the priests and the scribes were again appointed, 
which are often mentioned in the Gospel. Thus, | believe 
(not like others) that he is describing the condition of the 
people who returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian 
captivity, who had again ordered the worship and 
sacrifices as the Lord had commanded through Moses. 
Then the prophet again threatens the whole earth with 
desolation, after first describing, as | said, the godless 
people to whom Christ would come. For he deals with 
this immediately in the beginning of this chapter. For 
even then, namely when Christ came, there were again 
many ungodly people who deserved the desolation. The 
prophet sees all this here as it were present. For this is 
the course of the world, which, as it lasted from the 
beginning of the world, will last to the end, that when the 
word of God is made known by the grace of God, there 
are people who despise and persecute it, just as it 
happened before the Babylonian captivity. But because 
the Lord was a righteous judge, he could not suffer the 
contempt of his word without avenging it. He punished 
them with lamentable captivity. 

Then, after they were brought back from captivity and 
the pure word was reinstated together with the right 
worship, there was again no lack of false prophets who 
perverted the true word and turned the people away from 
the right godliness to godlessness, as all the histories of 
the gospel indicate. Therefore, it finally happened that 
the whole nation was completely destroyed and 
miserably rejected by the judgment of the Lord. 

We experience the same thing. We have the Word of 
clearly and abundantly. Many will 


a: proxfiiktavit; Wittenberg xroxtstat. We have 
assumed the latter. 


others despise and persecute it, which the wrath of God 
awaits. For it is impossible that the Lord should not 
avenge the contempt of His word. Therefore, we can 
proclaim with the utmost certainty that a great calamity 
will come upon the despisers of the Word. For here we 
cannot fail. Then, when the pure word is restored, there 
will never be a lack of people who will adulterate the word 
and this pure wine, until Christ puts an end to this evil 
and destroys all. And this is what | wanted to say as a 
preface to this chapter. 


V. i. Woe to the vile, foul, tyrannical city! 2) 
Just by this word, when he calls the city a redeemed 


one (redemptam), he indicates almost the entire content 
of this chapter, as if he wanted to say: You have been 
brought back from captivity and reinstated by the Lord to 
your old dignity, but still you do not cease to provoke God 
again by ungodliness and unbelief. For he starts from the 
highest vices, which are the roots and sources of all 
outward shameful deeds. For this is what God hates 
above all, and by it we provoke God, namely when we 
attribute righteousness to our powers and works, when 
we contend with God and want to be righteous, and do 
not suffer these abominations of ours to be condemned, 
but persist in defending them against the word of God 
2c. 

"The dove." Why he called Jerusalem a dove, we 
must guess. So it is also said in the Song of Solomon, 
Cap. 6, 8: "One is my dove." So here he calls Jerusalem 
the dove of the Lord, that is, the beloved one that he had 
chosen, as Isaiah [Cap. 1, 21.] calls it "the pious city." 
But secretly the prophet indicates that the Holy Spirit is 
in Jerusalem, because the Holy Spirit is the dove of God 
2c.

V. 2. She will not obey nor be chastened. 


All verba must be read in the indicative presentis, 
then the sense will be clearer. But here he enumerates 
the sins with which she will challenge the Lord, as if to 
say: she does not hear the voice of the Lord, she does 
not obey the voice of the Lord or the word of God. 
Immediately after the Babylonian captivity, they 
despised the true prophets; the Pharisees, the 
Sadducees, and other such sects forced their way in, by 
which the people were divided and corrupted with false 
opinions. Therefore, the word of God was not respected 
2c. 


She does not want to be chastised. 


That is, she does not want to be punished, does not 
want her own to be condemned, as | said shortly before. 
For so much is lacking in it that she abandons her ways, 
that she rather thinks that hers alone is godliness and 
the right worship. "Therefore let her not say." 


She does not want to trust in the Lord. 


That is, it teaches the righteousness of the flesh, not 
the faith that teaches to trust in and fear God. 


Nor hold to their God. 


One comes to God by knowledge, that is, by faith and 
not by works, not by hands or feet, but by constant 
perseverance and daily practice, which Paul calls "by 
faith into faith," from one power to another, from one 
glory of the Lord to another, until we become perfect 
men, as it says in the letter to the Ephesians [Cap. 4:3]. 


V. 3. her princes found lions roaring under her. 
He does not speak of the kings [, but of the rulers] 4) 
As if to say: kings. 


1) Added by us according to the Hall manuscript. The old translator 
has: "He speaks allhier of the kings." But all codices offer: 
IvHuitur eto. 


They will no longer have but violent tyrants who will 
devour all their possessions. Thus they will be inflamed 
with greed, possessed by extraordinary avarice, so that 
they make their goods bigger. For this is the first fruit of 
godlessness, avarice, which is followed by violence, 
indulgence, fornication, idleness 2c. 


And their judges wolves in the evening. 


The same word we had above in Habakkuk Cap. 1, 
8: "They are swifter than the wolves of the evening", 
where | said that it should have been translated: "than 
the wolves of the wilderness". But | am still uncertain in 
these two passages which of the two is more correct. 
Here he calls them evening wolves, and he also shows 
by this contrast, since he says: "who leave nothing over 
until the morning," that it must be translated in this way. 
Therefore the opinion is: So great is the rage of the 
judges, so great their avarice, that they are insatiable. 
For such great greed has taken hold of them that they 
would devour the whole nation at once, all the wealth 
and goods of the people. 


V. 4. Their prophets are frivolous (vesani). 


In German | would give it this way, "They are loose 
jacks, frivolous." The Septuagint have translated it quite 
daintily: 
swho let himself be driven by the wind. The same word 
is | Mos. 49, 4.: "He went along lightly like water." Paul 
has rendered it quite actually, when he says [Eph. 4, 14.]: 
"Do not be swayed and swayed by all kinds of wind of 
doctrine", [by this he means people,] who let themselves 
be turned everywhere by a slight impulse of the heart, 
just as poured out water flows apart without all order. It 
is the same word Jer. 23, 32, where the Latin interpreter 
shows his fullness of words in his own way by different 
translations: "They deceive my people with their lies and 
with their miracles. This, of course, agrees perfectly with 


the expression [Ve€Sanus] by which the Latin interpreter 
has translated the same word here. For how does the 
word "reckless" (V@SanuS) agree with the word 


"miracle"? Therefore, in Jeremiah he would have 
translated more correctly thus: "and with their 


1642 L. XXVII, 329-332. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3269-3272. 


1643 





loose divisions", that is, "with their babbling". So the same 
word is in the Book of Judges [Cap. 11, 3.], since the 
Scripture writes that to Jephthah "loose people" [Vulg: 


Viros 


inopes et latrocinantes - poor and predatory 
men], that is, "careless", who do not act 
seriously on a matter. So I translate here also: 
"Their prophets are careless", that is, 
heedless, who consider nothing well, act 
nothing seriously, who babble everything in 
the sermon that comes into their mouths, who 
do not pay attention to the great meaning of 
God's word. They think it is something 
human 2c., as he aks adds: 


And despisers. 


Instead of viri infideles it should be more correct: 
"despisers" who consider the word worthless, who do 
not take God's word into consideration. | have translated 
it in the Psalm [Ps. 25, 3. 119, 158J in German by 
"Verachter". 


Their priests desecrate the sanctuary. 


That is, the holy things, they treated the holy things 
in an unseemly manner. For this is desecrating holy 
things when we ascribe righteousness to them, when we 
teach people to trust in holy things as they taught trust 
in works, and so desecrated the temple and the 
sacrifices that GOD had not ordained for it 2c. 


And interpret the law sacrilegiously. 


That is, they have perverted the law, they have 
interpreted it carnally, not spiritually as it should be 
interpreted. For it is spiritual, as the apostle says [Rom. 
7:14]. Thus they profaned the sanctuary and the law by 
relying on the services, sacrifices and works required by 
the law. It is not that they did not keep the law, nor that 
they despised the temple and other holy things, as our 
interpreter might think, who is a works saint 1). 


V. 5 But the Lord, who is among them, teaches 
rightly and does no evil. 


1) Weimarsche: juaieiarius instead of: justieiarlus. 





He speaks of the Savior Christ JEsu, who teaches 
the right righteousness, not like them. For at that time, 
when Christ came, again the highest ungodliness 
prevailed, therefore he sat down against their 
ungodliness 2c. 


He lets all the mornings teach his rights publicly. 
Mane, mane, that is, very quickly and soon. For thus 


the prophets are wont to use the word Mane searly, as 
in the Psalm [Ps. 46:6.], "GOD help her early." The 
prophet's opinion, therefore, is: however much 
ungodliness may prevail when Christ the righteous 
comes, however much the Pharisees may blaspheme 
against the true righteousness which he will teach, and 
despise it as a vain thing, yet it will stand. He will bring 
forth his righteousness as a light; his cause will remain 
unharmed against the ungodly. For it will do them no 
good to want it suppressed: he will break through, he will 
advance his cause to the highest glory. It follows: 


But the bad people don't want to learn shame. 


That is. He will not approve of the shameful injustice 
of others, which another's people want to talk about. 
Thus it is said in the first Psalm, v. 6: "For the Lord knows 
the way of the righteous," that is, he approves the way 
of the righteous, it pleases him. And Christ will say to the 
ungodly [Matt. 25:12], "| Know not yours." In short, he will 
let the others pass away in their ungodly nature, he will 
have no fellowship with the rejected ungodly nature. 


V. 6. Therefore | will cut off these people and lay 
waste their castles. 


Here is a new section that is different from the 
previous one. For in this chapter the prophet has begun 
to address his prophecy to the people who had been 
brought back from Babylon, which we have explained 
above. Now he starts to tell them about the past benefits 
they received from the Lord, as if he wanted to say: | 
brought you back from the Babylonian captivity, | asked 
for your blessings. 


1644 


2- XXVII, 332-334. interpretation of Zephaniah (1.), cap. 3, 6. 7. W. VI, 3272-3275. 


1645 





| have led you out of Egypt with a strong hand and 
drowned Pharaoh with all his people, | have destroyed 
and overthrown the extremely powerful empires of the 
Babylonians and Assyrians, and yet you forget 
everything, everything becomes something old with you, 
you never once remember these miracles that have 
been done for you. For it happens, not only in human, 
but also in holy things, that nothing becomes obsolete 
faster than the gratitude and the memory of received 
benefits. So also in spiritual things we soon forget 
everything that has been granted to us through the grace 
of Christ. For how many people today remember from 
how great burdens and bonds of the pope we have been 
snatched by the gospel of Christ, which is now revealed 
to us? The same thing the prophet here impresses upon 


the Jews. "Their castles" (anguli earum! ) - their 
cornerstones), that is, the princes or heads. That is, | 
have destroyed the principalities in these nations; the 
kings with the princes | have destroyed. For so the 
scripture uses to call the princes or the heads of the 
kingdoms, sometimes it calls them heads, sometimes 
the hair, elsewhere the beard, mountains, elsewhere 
cornerstones 2c. 


And empty their alleys. 


As if he wanted to say: Now their kingdoms are very 
populous, young men and girls run in heaps to and fro 
on the streets. But | will take them all away, | will make 
them a wasteland, | will take away the multitude of the 
inhabitants. 


V.7 | said to you, "Fear me and be disciplined. 


That is, | sent you prophets who preached to you, who 
taught you that you should fear me, that you should be 
chastened, that is, that through the remembrance of 
those works and miracles which | did for you, you should 
learn to fear me, lest you do similar things to those which 
| did before, lest | again be- 


1) Instead of 6orum in our template, read earuru as it refers to 
mutes. 





would be compelled to destroy your dwellings, as | 
destroyed them before, when you were carried away into 
captivity. For if thou shalt not learn fear and discipline, | 
will not spare thy dwelling; as then he spared it not, 2) 
for the Romans have most miserably disturbed all 2c. 
And in these few words the prophet has understood 
everything that the life of a true Christian holds. For the 
fear of God brings with it faith, humility of heart, that we 
hold in honor the majesty of the Lord. Discipline includes 
the outward life, that we may walk in honorable manners, 
without offense to the brethren, one with the other, living 
demurely, one serving the other by love. This is the 
summa and the goal of all the prophets and all the 
Scriptures. 


But they are diligent to practice all kinds of 
wickedness. 


As if to say, "As much as the prophets taught fear, 
they did it all in vain. For nevertheless you continue to 
be ungodly, you persist in the ungodliness that you 
inherited from the fathers, and you do this with great 
zeal, with great effort. For "early" 3) means, as | also 
reminded you shortly before, quickly and hastily. Ps. 78, 
34: "And taught themselves early to God," that is, they 
came hastily to propitiate the Lord, to find grace 2c. So 
here: they rose up early and were eager to practice all 
wickedness, that is, they not only did not listen to the 
prophets who warned them, who taught the fear of God 
and discipline, but they were also zealous and busy to 
increase their ungodliness, to corrupt the faith and the 
outward life, since those who deny the faith are also unfit 
for all good works, as Paul says [Titus 1:16]. For we are 
of such a nature that we are more eager for ungodliness 
than for godliness. And Christ says [Luc. 16:8] that the 
children of this world are wiser in their generation than 
the children of light. 


2) Handwriting: pepereit; Wittenberger: anten pexerei.

But in the 14th Psalm, v. 1, there are almost the same 
words as here: "They are no good, and are an 
abomination with their nature." 


Vv. 8. Therefore, says the Lord, you must wait for 
me again, until | make myself ready in his time (ad diem 
resurrectionis meae in futurum). 


That is, because they do not care for the word of God, 
because | exhort in vain through the prophets, even 
though they have already returned from captivity, and 
have felt my wrath more than enough, therefore | am 
weary of them. | will go through the world and look for 
another people, but | will reject you. "I will make an end 
of you." It will happen in a short time that the kingdom will 
be taken from you and given to the Gentiles who bear its 
fruits 2c. [Matth. 21, 43.] | will provoke you on a foolish 
people, which is not a people 2c. [Deut. 32, 21.), as it is 
written in Genesis 1). And this will happen "at the time 
when | arise". | do not dislike the view, but | accept it, that 
one interprets this passage from the resurrection of 
Christ, as if he wanted to say: By the power of my 
resurrection, when | will have risen from death, it will 
happen that a new people will arise. But the other view is 


that this rising (SUrrectiO) of the Lord is taken, as the 
Scriptures take it, for avenging and preparing against the 
enemy. Thus it is written in the Psalm [Ps. 44, 24.], 
"Awake, O Lord, why sleepest thou?" and the opinion is, 
| will reject thee, | will choose me a new nation, when | 
shall make myself out, that is, by the Romans, whom | 
will send against thee, that they may destroy thee, and 
lay waste all that is thine. So it is also said in Moses [Ex. 
33:5], "I will come upon thee once suddenly, and will 
destroy thee" from all the face of the earth. Next, that he 


says in futurum, this 
extraordinarily, but the very simple opinion is this: de 


Jerome struggled over 


caetero [by the way], when | set out once more. 


1) "in Mose" by us, in agreement with the Zwickau and the HallWen 
manuscript, instead of: in OMa, which is found in the Weimar one. 


1647 


| will also do the right thing, and gather the nations 
together, and bring the kingdoms in multitude. 


The prophet declares of which rising he speaks, 
namely, of the raising of Christ, as | have said that | like 
this opinion before the other. For after Christ was raised 
again, he ascended into heaven, and became the judge 
of the whole world, as it is said in the Psalm [Ps. 110:6.], 
"He shall judge among the Gentiles." Therefore, "the 
judging" here does not mean both the execution of wrath 
and the office and power to rule, as it is in many places 
in the Psalms. But this gathering of the kingdoms and the 
Gentiles was done through the word of the gospel, which 
was spread throughout the whole world. 


To pour out my wrath on them, yes, all the wrath of 
my fury. 

The apostle Paul interpreted this with round words in 
his letter to the Romans, Cap. 1, 18: "God's wrath from 
heaven is revealed against all ungodliness and 
unrighteousness of men" 2c. For the voice of the gospel 
is this [Matth. 3, 2. 4, 17.], "Repent, the kingdom of 
heaven is at hand." And Christ says Luc. 24:47, 
"Repentance had to be preached in his name." For the 
gospel first proclaims the flood of the Lord's wrath and 
fury, as he says here, "My wrath will | pour upon them, 
yea, all the fury of my wrath. "2c. For he thus says [Marc. 
16, 16.], "He that believeth not shall be damned," 
likewise [John 3, 18.], "He that believeth not is already 
judged." 


Vv. 9. Then | will preach differently to the nations 
with friendly lips (abium purum). 
Thus the prophet turns all his words so that we cannot doubt 
that all this must be understood from the Gospel. 
[That they may all call upon the name of the Lord.] 


Thus he describes here "the friendly lips" as the 
invocation of the name of the Lord and the unanimous 
worship. Therefore, the opinion is: | want these people 
who practice wickedness, who do not use the word GO1- 


1648 L. XXVII, 336-339. interpretation of Zephaniah (1.), cap. 3, 9-12. W. VI, 3277-3280. 


But | will prepare for myself a holy people, and | will give 
them a pure mouth, which shall teach my word aright, 
and call upon my name. And therefore he says: | will 
make (or change) it differently, as if he wanted to say: 
Your lips are unclean, as it says in Isaiah Cap. 6, 5. 
Therefore | will give to the nations other lips that are 
pure; they shall teach the word of faith, which is pure and 
unpolluted, and shall receive very abundant fruit thereof. 
For they shall call upon my name, which they could not 
otherwise do, if they taught not with pure lips, that is, the 
pure gospel. For where works and reliance on works are 
mixed into the teaching of faith, they cannot call upon 
the name of the Lord, for (Rom. 10:14.] "How shall they 
call upon Him in whom they believe not?" 


And serve him with one accord (humero uno). 


Humero uno, that is, in unity and with one accord. 
They will not limp on both sides, as Elijah says 1 Kings 
18:21: "How long will you limp on both sides?" All will be 
of one mind. 


V. 10: They will bring me my worshippers, namely 
the scattered ones from beyond the water in the land 
of the Moors, as a gift. 


He indicates the fruit of the gospel, namely that this 
people of his will be holy and pure of lip, not only among 
the neighboring nations, but also among the most 
distant peoples. For there will be worshippers on the 
other side of the river in the temple, not only in 
Jerusalem. For their sound has gone out into all the 
earth [Rom. 10, 18. Ps. 19, 5.]. And Christ says [Jn. 4:21, 
23], "The time is coming, and is already now, that ye 
shall worship neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem: 
but the true worshippers shall worship in spirit and in 
truth." Likewise, my people scattered everywhere will 
bring me gifts, not only in the temple at Jerusalem. So 
even everything will become new, a new way of praying, 
of sacrificing, and a new people. This is certainly an 
excellent passage, which teaches the abdication of the 
law in very clear words. For 





1649 


The law forbids sacrificing and praying elsewhere than 
in the special and certain place, namely in the temple at 
Jerusalem. But the Christians offer spiritual sacrifices 
daily to God, as Paul says, Rom. 12, 1: "Offer your 
bodies for sacrifice, which is holy" 2c. But he calls them 
"the scattered ones." So also Peter writes his [first] 
epistle [Cap. 1, 1.) to the elect strangers who are 
scattered s "to and fro") in Galatia 2c. For the Christians 
are scattered over the whole world; they do not come 
together in one place as the Jews had to come together. 


V.11. At that time you will no longer be ashamed of 
everything you have done. 

That is, | will purify my people for myself, | will have 
true saints, there will be no hypocrisy among them, nor 
the impurity of ungodly 1) teachings that stain souls, but 
| will sanctify them all by giving the Holy Spirit into their 
hearts as he appends and interprets: 


For | will do the proud saints from you. 

As if to say: Until now you have always been 
reproached for having false teachers with unclean lips, 
master, after whom your ears itch; always the prophets 
have punished you because of your proud saints, that is, 
who praised the righteousness of the flesh and works. 
But | will do it from you, for | teach the opposite, namely 
that one must completely despair of the powers, wisdom 
and righteousness of the flesh; all men are guilty of 
damnation, there is nothing of which the flesh can boast 
from itself, as the apostle Rom. 3, 27. says: "Where then 
is the glory? It is out. "2c. Likewise [v. 19]: "That all 
mouths might be stopped up, and that all the world might 
be indebted to God," so that he who wants to boast might 
boast in the Lord, Jer. 9, 24.

That is, the apostles and a few remnants in Israel. The 
most powerful and wise, the

The most select part of the people, as the priests and 
rulers, will perish. But the poor and lowly people | will 
leave among you, who will hope in the name of the Lord. 
With few but very fitting words he describes the church 
of Christ, namely that it is a poor people, scanty and 
oppressed, who call upon the Lord and hope in the Lord. 
This is the highest righteousness and the highest 
worship. 


V. 13: The rest of Israel will do no evil. 


It indicates the virtues or powers and the effect of 
faith. So also John 1 Joh. 3, 9. says: "Whoever is born of 
GOD does not sin, for his seed abides with him and 
cannot sin, because he is born of GOD." But we are born 
of God through faith, John 1:12, 13. 


Nor speak falsely, and you will not find a fraudulent 
tongue in their mouth. 


"A deceitful tongue," that is, one that seduces souls 
under a good pretense, that promises something other 
than what it can deliver. For it teaches and promises 
righteousness and delivers man to death 2c. 


But they shall feed and rest without all fear. 


They shall be shepherded, namely by the word of the 
Gospel. "They shall rest," namely in peace, in a good 
conscience. They shall have a quiet conscience before 
God, so that nothing can frighten them. Rom. 5, 1. says: 
"Now that we have been justified by faith, we have peace 
with God," 2c., and Cap. 8, 31.: "If God is for us, who can 
be against us?" For this is the glory of Christ's kingdom, 
that we may rejoice and be at peace through Christ, who 
has reconciled us to God. Not as if there will be no cross 
left, not as if the world and the devil will not pursue us, 
but the conscience is fortified and secure against all this, 
so that it does not care about any of this. And this is the 
work of God's power in us, as the apostle Paul says. 


VI. 3280-3283. 1651 


V. 14. Rejoice, you daughter of Zion! 


After Christ's kingdom has been described, the 
prophet now wishes Israel and the daughter of Zion 
happiness in all these things that follow, that is, the 
believers that such a kingdom has been granted to them, 
just as Paul also wishes the Romans happiness in the 
knowledge of Christ, Rom. 1:8: "I thank my God through 
Jesus Christ for all your sakes. "Rejoice," that is, give 
thanks, be glad in the Lord. 


Shout, Israel! 


Also from this it is very clear that the prophet does not 
speak of the temporal kingdom, since he introduces 
Israel jubilantly, since, as is clear from Hosea, Israel was 
never brought back or restored after the captivity. 
Therefore, he clearly indicates the kingdom of grace 
through Christ, which has been spread exceedingly far 
into the whole world and has gathered all nations and 
kingdoms, as he said above, both from the Jews and 
from the Gentiles. 


V. 15 For the LORD has taken away your 
punishment. 


In this speech [abstulit Dominus judicium tuum] 
is an ambiguity. The same way of speaking is in Job 
[Cap. 27, 2. Vulg.]: "The Lord has taken away my 
judgment", that is, he does not pronounce justice for me, 
he has not allowed a judgment in "my" favor. But here 
the opinion is completely opposite, and here the prophet 
did not use the word "judgment" differently than Paul 1 
Cor. 11, 31: "For if we judged ourselves, we would not 
be judged by the Lord," that is, if we punished ourselves. 
Likewise Rom. 13:2: "But they that resist shall receive 
judgment of themselves." So here: The Lord has taken 
away your judgment, that is, He no longer wants to 
punish you, He no longer wants to punish you, but loves 
you as a beloved daughter, You now have God as an 
exceedingly loving Father, no longer as a judge who 
wants to frighten your conscience through the law. And 
this is what the prophet calls "judgment", that is, the 
wrath of God threatened to us by the law; namely, that 
be taken away. 


1652 L. XXVII, 342-344. interpretation of Zephaniah (1.), 


And your enemies averted. 


Namely, so that they can no longer harm you, no 
matter how much they invade you, no matter how much 
they rage against you. For there will be no lack of people 
who want to see you completely destroyed, but be 
confident: The Lord is the one who makes it so that you 
do not have to be afraid, so that you can rest and not be 
frightened. So also the prophet says [Ps. 118:18], "The 
LORD chasteneth me, but giveth me not unto death." 
And Ps. 105," 14th: "He let no man harm them." 


The LORD, the King of Israel, is with you. 


That is, he, the right HER, is now your king and in the 
midst of you, now you no longer have men ruling over 
you, but the HER himself. Joh. 14, 23.: "We will come to 
him and make our abode with him." For GOD is present 
in the hearts of believers, whom He calls His temple 2c. 


That you must no longer fear any misfortune. 


This is what he said above about the safety and 
turning away of enemies. It is different to suffer a 
calamity than to fear a calamity, just as it is different to 
die than to see or taste death, as Christ says in John 
[Cap. 8, 51]. Thus the law is dead to us, having been 
stripped of its power and sting, so that it can no longer 
terrify us, so that it no longer has the right to vilify us. So 
also death, although it attacks the righteous, still cannot 
frighten him, "s cannot exercise its tyranny against him 
and on him. Therefore, death is more properly for him 
only a sleep. Thus the prophet says here also of the fear 
of enemies, as it is also said in the Psalm [Ps. 64, 2. 
Vulg.], "Deliver my soul from the fear of the enemy." For 
so far does a calamity hurt as one feels it. The wicked, 
however, are saddened and depressed by misfortune; 
the fear of misfortune seizes them, that is, inwardly in 
their conscience they are terrified by death and sin; 
because they do not feel the fear of the enemy.

cap. 3, 15-17. W. VI, 3283-3286. 1653 


are fortified by the strength of God, that peace and 
assurance of faith is not in their hearts 2c. 


At that time they will say to Jerusalem, "Do not be 
afraid. 

As it is said in the Psalm [Ps. 118, 15.]: "One sings 
with joy of victory in the tents of the righteous", as if the 
prophet wanted to say: This alone you will hear, this 
alone will be preached to you: Do not be afraid, daughter 
of Zion, for you have God your King with you. Whom, 
therefore, would you fear? "If GOD is for us, who can be 
against us?" [Rom.8, 31.] And so, with the greatest 
consolations, he nevertheless secretly indicates that 
cross and hostile adversaries will be there, but that also 
the power of the Spirit will be there, by which they shall 
be strengthened, lest they be broken by calamity, lest 
they be defeated, in short, lest they fear the enemies. 
For Satan never ceases to attack the saints, and 
however much the saints resist, they are sometimes 
overcome by weariness and the long duration, as some 
among the Fathers have said. For Satan always 
perseveres tirelessly, and carries on what he has 
undertaken. Therefore it is added: 


And to Zion, let not thine hands be loosed. 
That is, persevere, do not desist, "stop" 2c. 


V. 17.2) For the LORD your God is with you, a strong 
Savior. He will rejoice over you. 

All this indicates that the consciences will experience 
this fatherly kindness of the Lord, their King. And this is 
the opinion: You will feel joy, you will realize in your 
conscience that the Lord wants you well, that he is 
present with you as a kind father in all things. For then it 
is said that the Lord rejoices over us because he makes 
us feel his favor, his kindness. He has described the 
nature of the kingdom of Christ in the most appropriate 
and clear way. For so it is with the godly that he allows 
them to be attacked.

that they are troubled in many ways and afflicted with 
many evils, so that they may be conformed to their King, 
but he adds this sense of joy, this security of heart, that 
everything becomes sweet, that nothing can separate 
them from the love of God, Rom. 8, 38. f. 


And be kind to you(Silebit in dilectione sua). 


He will be silent in his love, not in yours, as we read 
[in the Vulgate], that is, he will make you silent, so that in 
the innermost part of your heart there will be the quietest 
peace and calm silence. There will not be roaring and 
shouting, "as in the hearts of the wicked when they are 
beset by adversity, lacking this security of heart. 


And will be happy above you with sound. 


That is, you will feel that He wants you well, and this 
feeling of God's goodness and kindness will cause you 
to be joyful with praise. Daily you will give thanks, praise 
and rejoice in God your Savior. 


V. 18: | will take away those who were troubled by 
the statutes. 


Thus [namely, nugas, qui a lege recesserant, 


congregabo,] Jerome translated, and he has his 
reasons, by which he was guided, to translate thus, since 


he thought that NUgas Was a Latin word, which was 
taken from the Hebrew language, since this is the mother 
of all other languages. But it is strange to me that God 
has so grossly lacked such great people, as Jerome, 
such a great man, has also so grossly lacked in a 
grammatical matter. For this is not the Hebrew word 
which he wants, but the right word is Sodann, where we 


read: qui a lege recesserant, the Hebrew word actually 
means a certain time, as is quite clear from many other 
passages of Scripture. Gen. 1, 14: "And give times", 
where completely the same word is. And in the Psalm 
[Ps. 104, 19]: "You make the moon to divide the year 


according to it" (In tempora). And in the book of Judges 


[Cap. 20, 38.]: We will give you a sign or a certain time. 
And in the Psalms it is translated by 





Feast days, as also with us the Michaelistag is, the 
Walpurgistag and the day of the birth of Christ, and | do 
not know which else. Therefore, according to the 
Hebrew, | translate thus: Those oppressed by sorrow | 
will gather temporally (or when the time is there), who are 
of you. And the opinion is: The kingdom of Christ will be 
such that it will gather those who are oppressed by 
sorrow for a time, that is, those who have fallen into some 
sin out of weakness. Thus Paul says in the Epistle to the 
Galatians [Cap. 6, 1]: "If any man be overtaken in any 
fault, restore him with a gentle spirit, ye that are spiritual" 
2c. In short, Christ bears those who are weak in faith and 
life to be punished, reminded, and taken up until they 
increase. Therefore, Christ's motherly mercy is indicated 
in this passage, that he cherishes and carries us no 
differently than a mother keeps her little child and 
caresses it. Thus says Isaiah cap. 49:15: "Can a woman 
forget her little child, and not have compassion on the son 
of her womb? Though she forget him, yet will | not forget 
thee." Likewise Cap. 46, 3. f.: "You who are carried by 
me in the womb and lie with me in the mother. Yes, | will 
carry you until you are old and gray. | will do it, | will lift 
and carry and save." Namely, this leniency of Christ 
makes it so that neither weakness in faith nor in life can 
harm us, if only we keep to the loud word, if only we do 
not fall out of this bosom of God in which He carries us. 
If this happens [ that we remain in the word], the kind 
Father easily closes his eyes to all "other" sins. 


What statutes were their burden, from which they 
had shame. 

Because the gospel is completely pure, it teaches 
completely pure faith and righteous love for one's 
neighbor, the highest morality and purity. Therefore, 
reason immediately censures the "preachers" of the word 
for their "life" and "morals" if it sees that they do not agree 
in all respects with the completely pure doctrine that they 
"preach. 


1656 L. XXVII, 347-350. interpretation of Zephaniah (1.), cap. 3, 18-20. W. VI, 3288-3291. 


1657 





For they judge their lives according to their doctrine, and 
so they also despise the doctrine. Today, the enemies 
of the gospel counter that they always hear the gospel 
from us, but see nothing gospel; they say that we live 
differently than we teach. These may be mindful of what 
man is, namely a being endowed with reason, who is 
commanded by God to rule over all creatures, Gen. 1:28. 
But look at a child, how in him there is nothing at all to 
be seen of such a powerful ruler, since he is the most 
miserable of all living creatures, which cannot help itself 
at all. It depends only on foreign help, otherwise it would 
have to perish. Admittedly, such a child would like to rule 
over all creatures and living beings, which lies in the 
cradle and can do nothing but cry, as Pliny says much 
about it. But nevertheless the dominion over all 
creatures still remains to him; although it is not before 
the eyes, it is still to be hoped for. For for this purpose 
the child is nourished, for this purpose it is nurtured and 
cared for, so that it may finally, when it gains strength, 
seize this dominion of its own when it grows up. The 
same happens with all creatures, with trees, with seeds, 
with plants, with fruits. Because this is necessary in the 
least things, it must happen much more in the highest 
and divine things, that we grow from day to day by faith 
in faith, until we become great and meet the Lord as 
perfect men, as the apostle says in the letter to the 
Ephesians Cap. 4, 14. In the meantime, however, God, 
our kind Father, overlooks our weakness and easily 
forgives everything, so that we have no shame from it, if 
we only keep the word unharmed and pure, if we only 
remain in the body and the bosom of God, in which He 
always carries us 2c. 


V.19. Behold, | will make terms with all those who 
offend you at the same time. 


In Hebrew, ecce ego interficiam] Ecce ego faciam. 
It is a Mosaic word, because this is how Moses used to 
speak: He will make a burnt offering for sin, that is, he will 


sacrifice it or kill it. Virgil 1) also said: Cum faciam 
vitula pro fru-. 
1) Ecloge Ill v 77. 





gibus [when | will sacrifice a calf for the fruits) 2c. The 
same opinion has been correctly rendered by our 
interpreter, as if to say: God allows the wicked to reign 
and triumph for a time, raging against the godly, until 
their iniquities become full; then he corrupts them 
irrevocably and takes vengeance on them. 


And wants to help the limp. 
This is almost taken from Micah Cap. 4, 7. But it 
means the people who were afflicted in many ways with 
various ills and tribulations. 


And collect the outcasts. 
Namely, through the Word. 


And will make them pee and honor in all lands 
where they are despised. 

That is, when they have glorified me by the cross, 
when they shall suffer my hand, then shall the time come 
that their right shall again be brought to light [Ps. 37:6.], 
it shall come to pass that they shall again be made 
glorious. Thus says Christ [Matt. 10:32.], "Whosoever 
shall confess me before men, him will | confess also 
before my Father." Thus the apostles and the martyrs 
are finally set in honor before God and the whole world, 
whom the world had previously considered the most 
despised of men, as Paul also says [2 Cor. 4, 13.), for 
the sweepings of the world 2c. Now their memory is in 
blessing, like that of John Hus and all who suffered 
persecution and death for God's glory. Their memory, 
which had long been obscured, is now reviving. But the 
memory of the wicked perishes; as they perish in the 
highest shame and disgrace, so they also remain in 
disgrace 2c. 


V. 20.2) For | will make you praise and honor among 
all nations. 

With this peculiar saying he understands a general 
one, as if he wanted to say: You have suffered the 
Babylonian captivity, you are afflicted in many ways, but 
| will not only deliver you from this captivity, but also 
much more from death, the devil and hell. Amen. 

To Christ be praise and glory.

2, interpretation on the prophet Zephaniah, 


according to the Zwickau manuscript. *) 


From lectures given from August 13 to about September 10, 1525. Printed in 1886. 


Translated from Latin. 


This prophet is easily and completely clear, since he 
himself describes at what time and from what cause he 
prophesied. Like the previous prophets, he prophesies 
very clearly and with quite open and many words about 
the kingdom of Christ. The kingdom of Judah was to be 
destroyed by the Chaldeans, but in such a way that this 
far most valuable kingdom was to be restored. A very 
great faith is required, because they will be led away into 
captivity against the revealed promise of God. 





den. He fulfills his promises wonderfully, as he did in the 
Chaldean captivity, when he destroys the kingdom from 
the ground up 2c. He prophesies before the time of the 
captivity, as can be seen from the title: "In the time of 
Josiah and Amon, the kings of Judah", 1) of Manasseh 
2c. Zedekiah, under whom Jerusalem was devastated 
and all the people were carried away, left three sons. 


1) Thus the manuscript erroneously reads instead of: "In the days 
of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah." 


[The first chapter. |

Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, was the father of 
Amon. 2) Josiah is one of the noblest kings of Judah. 
This prophet was shortly before the captivity. The 
question which Jerome raises here because of the 
genealogical register of this prophet does not move me 
2c. Among the people there was a class of prophets, the 
priests 2c. [Jer. 18, 18.] 3) He was a child of the 
prophets, that is, his parents were of the number of the 
prophets; not as if all prophesied. The prophets 
educated the Jewish youth. Under Elisha were "children

that has taken away those who use them for food,

which, when it flourishes, there is a great consumption

have ceased. In anger, the prophet lifts up, as he calls

not do away with all idolatry 2c. Thus there is a passage 
in the fourth book of Moses [Cap. 23, 21/, where it seems 
as if completely [all idolatries were taken away] 2c. [But 
Amos [Cap. 5, 25] speaks in the same way as 
Stephanus Apost. 7, 42. f. says. It stood so with it that 
they did not rule, there remained [however] remnants, 
and one understands it in such a way, as if the whole 
abomination was exterminated. Thus Paul praises the 
whole church of the Corinthians, and yet he rebukes 
some. Therefore it is enough in the people of God that 
the service of God is going on, although some are 2c. 
[Paul rebukes the commonwealth of the Corinthians for 
having suffered fornication [1 Cor. 5:1 ff]. See the Epistle 
to the Romans, cap. 1 at the end [v. 32.], "But have 
pleasure also in them that do it." After the synecdoche 
the whole is put for the part, and again. The children of 
Israel were holy when seen from the public regiment 
under Moses, but they were also unclean 2c. So under 
Josiah 2c. He abolished the regiment of the ungodly, but 
not the ungodliness itself. So we can administer the 
gospel 2c. though some 2c. But if we always punish, 
admonish 2c. For here the people are called holy, 
because of the government that is administered holy, 
and it is said that remnant remain 2c. 


In addition, the name of the camarim (aedituorum) 
and priests from that place.

her memory from the earth." Rome has _ perished, 
Babylon. That is, they [the Camarin/ are not praised, not 
held in honor, since they were taken away with the 
captives. 3) "The Camarim." See in the books of Kings 
[2 Kings 23:5] this name. It is uncertain what kind of 
people these were, who were well practiced in the 
[ungodly] worship of God.

In the first book of Moses s*Cap. 43, 30/ it says: "His

Monks, as the observant, who boast, improve others, 
[call themselves] the cheerful, the improved 2c., who are 
more tried and practiced in the service of idols [than 
others]. He emphatically adds the name "Camarim," as 
if they were more respected among the people, like our 
St. Bernards, Observants 2c. who are the most 
distinguished among the monks of this kind. These

that all leaven is swept out. Therefore, it must be daily 
leavened in our bodies and in the bodies of others. It is 
impossible that there is no wickedness, only it must not 
prevail 2c. If it had been possible to do away with it, it 
would certainly have been done under Josiah, so great 
a spirit and zeal was in that king. 


Vv. 5 And those who worship on the housetops of 
the heavenly host. 


The prophet indicates another horrible trouble, 
namely that they worship the host of heaven. This is 
often scolded in Jeremiah, where he says [Cap. 7, 18. 
44, 17. ff.) of the queen of heaven that this people 
worshipped the moon 2c., against the commandment of 
Moses [5th book, Cap. 17, 3. 4, 19.) 2c. It was easy for 
the people to be deceived into worshipping the sun, the 
moon 2c. When they bent their knees before the sun 
they thought): There is GOD, there He is most found; 
where is a greater and brighter light? It is not impossible, 
because ours [worshipped] stones and wood, that those 
also did something of the kind, that they worshipped 
f‘the sun and the moon itself) 2c. Under this service, in 
this way [God] must be worshipped 2c. That was 
forbidden.

walked around, ate and played, like us on an open 


square (foro). 


And yet swear by the Lord and at the same time by 
Malchom. 


He must also cut off those who swear by the Lord and 
at the same time by Malchom, or by the king of it [the 
host of heaven], or by their king. | do not know whether 
to translate: by their king or: by Malchom, but | prefer: by 
their king. It is good and holy to swear by the LORD, the 
one God, and yet they will be cut off because they do 
not swear by the LORD alone 2c. [Deut. 6:13:] "You shall 
worship GOD your LORD and serve Him alone." It is not 
necessary to limp on both sides, so that whatever | do, | 
do to the LORD alone. -He therefore condemns not that 
they have sworn by the LORD, but that they have 
wrought a service of the king apart from the service of 
GOD 2c. Thus in the history of Saul [1 Sam. 8, 204d [it 
was wrong], not that they desired a king, but that they 
trusted in the same: We also will have a king to go before 
us 2c. These are words of unbelief. Thus, those are 
condemned here who make the king equal to GOD by 
trusting in GOD and in the king. God does not want to 
suffer this, he does not want to give his honor to another 
[Jos. 42, 8]. They ascribe the honor of swearing also to 
the king, which is due to GOtte alone 2c. [1 Sam. 17, 
55:] "As your soul lives," and since Paul says [1 Cor. 15, 
31.], "By our glory" 2c., there is swearing by that which 
is not GOD 2c. | leave this to the conscience 2) [of each 
one]. One must swear by God alone, serve God alone, 
but in such a way that we are subject to the power [Rom. 
13, 1. ff.]. Only in this way can | swear by God. The 
difference lies in the heart: | can swear by a creature, 
but in such a way that this is done solely for the sake of 
God.

schehe. Here the attitude must be looked at. The wicked 
swear like the godly, the godly in good faith. The godly 
and the godless trust in the king; the former sins, the 
latter does not. The godly does not ask for gold if he 
cannot have God; the godless does not ask for God if he 
cannot have gold. 


V. 6. and those who fall away from the Lord. 
This is how Moses used to talk. 


And who ask nothing of the Most High, and respect 
Him not. 

Or, those who do not care about God. Not only the 
obviously ungodly will | cut off, but also all others in 
whom there is neither faith nor love, neither observance 
of the law of faith, nor of love, nor of ceremonies. Here 
they are called by name who say, | have bought a house 
[Luc. 14, 19. f.] 2c. He means] the lazy pleasure seekers, 
who do not care about the Lord and his word 2c. 


V. 7. Be still before the LORD, for the day of the 
LORD is at hand; for the LORD has prepared a 
sacrifice. 


Hostiam, that is, a sacrifice. It is an exhortation: 
Since this will happen, that everything will be taken away 
from the land 2c., therefore "be still, be told", give room, 
hear the word, do not rage against the word, "for the day 
of the LORD is near". For the LORD "will prepare a 
sacrifice." 1) He speaks in images, "It is a matter of 
slaughter." In sacrifice, the sacrificial animals are killed. 
"He will also slaughter once", he will kill you ungodly. 


And invited his guests to it (et sanctificavit vocatos 
suos). 

[Sanctificavit, he sanctified/ is said of the Chaldeans, 
because those are prepared to devour the sacrifice. He alludes to 
the manner of the sacrifice; those who were to eat were 
sanctified, that they might be worthy 2c. The sacrifice is 


prepared, that is you, he will invite guests who will eat; 
1) Since these words are given in German, immediately before: 
instead of: prasparavit willbe — read. 





these are the Chaldeans, [he] "has his guests ready". He 
mocks at the same time the sacrifices of these wicked, 
fund their purifications,] that they may be pure, not only 
to sacrifice to the Lord, but also to idols. The Lord will 
one day prepare a sacrifice, "that will be you" 2c. 


V. 8. 2) And on the day of the Lord's sacrifice | will 
visit the princes and the king's children. 


He continues in his threat as he began. Imagine, on 
the one hand, the zeal and fervor of the prophet, and on 
the other, the obstinacy and obduracy of the listeners, 
the princes. This is a constant dispute. The word is 
accepted by a few, by the lowly and the oppressed; by 
the great, the mighty, the kings 2c. it is despised, as it is 
in our time. Therefore he is forced to threaten the divine 
wrath with many words, because he has hardened 
listeners and false-spiritual Pharisaic preachers, who 
advise the princes quite differently 2c. "The sacrifice" is 
that of which it is said in the previous text, since he 
began to slaughter you by the Chaldeans and to prepare 
a sacrifice for himself. The kings who are now safe 
praise the temple of the LORD 2c. [saying,] The prophet 
is nonsensical, he speaks against the law and the word 
of the LORD and the temple, “against] the children of the 
king, who yet are appointed by GOD. They did not mean 
that [the prophecy] would come 2c. The young people in 
that nation were instructed in the word of GOD; they 
trusted in the promise that had happened to David and 
to the kingdom. Here he speaks against the sons of the 
king. Notice the words of the promise: The lamp shall not 
go out 2c. [2 Sam. 7, 12. ff.] If the pope had such a 
mighty word, who could stand? He searches the kings 
home 2c., and yet he keeps his promise. Jechaniah is 
taken captive. M’affe had three sons, 3) one is by the 
king. 


2) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 

3) Here the scribe will have made a mistake, because his 
information does not agree with the holy history. If instead of 
"Manasseh" Josiah, and instead of "Israel" Egypt is put, it is almost 
correct. 


1666 L. xxvii, 23i-23t. Interpretations on the prophets. 


of Israel, two led away by the king to Babylon. On 
lechaniah the promise remained, who, being led away to 
Babylon, was kept in the dungeon. After 
Nebuchadnezzar died, he is delivered and this kingdom 
is restored. It was not destroyed, but only humiliated. 
Reason could not grasp this. They understood the divine 
promise in such a way that they (the kings) should 
remain on their throne 2c. God thinks like this: | will 
preserve this kingdom even if he [the king] is not on his 
throne, even if he is taken away, even if he is in prison. 
Glorious works! This is what the prophet says, but no 
one believes it. 


Who wear a foreign dress. 


The commentators differ, they say it is about the 
service of idols 2c. But | would rather stick to the point 


and keep to the fact that it is about secular things (in 


materia seculari); it speaks of the kings and of the 
children of the kings. | take it simply from the kings 
themselves, who imitated the customs of the ring- 
dwellers and changed the native dress, 1) namely, they 
adopted the dress of the pagans, as we Germans soon 
imitate what we see among the French, Turks, Italians 
2c. Having become too secure, they carelessly imitated 
the clothing of the pagans. They deviated from the 
former respectability and did not keep the paternal 
customs. Those who make such changes in dress are 
accused of frivolity, like the French. They are ruined by 
excessive certainty, who praised the promise against the 
prophets: David, David! No, He does not look at the 
persons, he who has sinned will be punished. 


V. 9: At the same time | will punish those who cross 
the threshold, who fill their masters’ houses with 
robbery and deceit. 

This still refers to the priesthood and the customs of 
idolatry. "Over the threshold." This word is given in the 
Song of Songs (Cap. 2, 8/ by: "on the hills". 


1) In our template: 6t ruutnrunt Mnitilitiurn Unditum -- and changed 
the pagan dress. 





1667 


Notice what Lyra says here. | let that go. Our effort is to 


let the prophet speak coherently (continuare), so that 
the sense exists and has coherence. | dislike always 
introducing other opinions. So far the prophet has 
punished the princes 2c. and threatened them with 
removal, which they did not expect; now he punishes the 
flatterers and servants 2c. who fill the house of their 
lords or masters with injustice or violence and with 
deceit. He does not speak of the servants and keepers 
of the temple, but of the servants of the masters. He calls 
them people "who leap over the threshold". He wants to 
say: now they are safe, insolent, "muthwillig". They rely 
on their lords and masters, they do everything to serve 
them, they deceive the people not only with false goods, 
with false measure; that is, with violence, with 
impetuosity, they rob publicly. As an example we have 
"our officials," from whom the people suffer greater 
harassment, violence and deceit, whom they must fear 
more than the Lord Himself; "they make [themselves] 
disgusting" 2c. They are the most harmful corruption of 
the whole world, even among good princes, since they 
mock and oppress the people they oppress with the 
utmost certainty. But he calls them people who jump 
over the threshold to indicate that they are servants and 
not masters, who only go in and out. See the passage in 
the law [Deut. 15, 17] of the awl 2c., so that he is 
reminded of his office, as if he wanted to say: You are 
only a guest in the house, tomorrow you may go out, you 
have only the threshold of the house. It is a secret 
cheating like that of the salesmen and merchants. The 
servants say: [It] "nas no need", where the masters stay, 
there we will also stay. 


V. 10: In that day, saith the LORD, there shall be a 
loud cry from the fish gate. 


He is making a threat: Because of these injustices will 
come 2c. As for the location of Jerusalem, one must 
know Nehemiah, who describes it quite carefully. It had 
two high and famous hills; one higher and one lower in 
a sloping place 2c. where Mount Moriah was.

where Solomon's temple stood, where Isaac was to be 
sacrificed 2c. The higher and more respectable one is 
above the city, after it a valley 2c. It slopes down on the 
side towards midnight. The "fish gate" is the one towards 
the evening, towards the midland sea 2c. "At the fish 
gate." [Jerufalem] had three walls. The outermost one 
had its houses. The second wall, which was called the 
other or "the other part"; in the second book of Kings 
[Cap. 22, 14.]: "Hulda [dwelt at Jerusalem in the other 
part "j. The interior of the city is the two hills of the temple 
and the castle of Zion. He wants to say: "At the same 
time there will be cries of great distress and anguish from 
the first gate, from the outermost wall, likewise in the 
second, likewise in the third, that is, the whole city will be 
shaken and full of cries, because it will be devastated and 
destroyed. He divides it into three parts so that he leaves 
nothing of the people. 


And a howl from the other Thor. 


Not of the enemies, but of the shattered people, of those 
who are wounded to death 2c. "The other gate" because 
they could not defend the outer ones 2c. There will be no 
protection, it will not help to say: The temple of the Lord! 
2c. This is a great threat that the whole city shall perish, 
for 


V. ii. Hay, ye that dwell in the mill: for all the grocers 
are gone. 

"It is gone", they are ruined, they are exterminated. 
From the future effect he gives them the name and calls 
it "a mill". Jerome thinks that it is called of the valley 


Siloah 2c. [Pila] which means "a mortar." In Proverbs 
[Cap. 27, 22.] one has pila and pilum, "a mortar, a 


pestle." Thus [pila] Jerome has translated. | take the 
view of the use of the mortar, as grain and specimens 
are pounded to the smallest dust. He takes, as it were, 
the whole of Jerusalem into a mortar, and imagines that 
it will be pounded. [He will "throw into one another and 
make his mortar once" from the city, that this crushing 
should be a punishment. The 


City will be the mortar, you the grains that will be 
pounded 2c. Jerusalem "reminds me like a mortar" in 
which they will be pounded 2c. | have pounded it so 
many times, but nothing comes of it. See Solomon in 
Proverbs [Cap. 27, 22.] You are a mortar to me 2c., but | 
do nothing to it. If by guilt cannot be pounded, then by 
punishment will be pounded 2c. [You inhabitants of the 
mortar, that is, you citizens of Jerusalem, who are 
crushed by the prophets, will finally be crushed 
altogether, so that you will be scattered throughout the 
world 2c. "It is gone"; [the word] means to be silent, "is 
made still," will be made solitary, so that it will be a 
silence, not of words, but rather of things, so that he will 
let the use of things be silent and nothing be. It is gone, 
it is made silent, it is made to be nothing. 


The hawker people (Chanaan). 
By the Cananaeans he wants to understand without 


doubt the Jews. Canaan, that is, the Jewish merchants 
who filled the houses of the lords by robbery and deceit. 


If it [Canaan] is taken as a proper name, then the opinion 
is: you are no longer Judah, but rather Canaan, for GOD 
will do to you as He did to Canaan. | like that opinion 
better. Similarly it is said in Ezekiel [Cap. 16, 3.], "Thy 
father is of the Amorites, and thy mother of the Hittites." 
And Daniel says [History of Susanna, v. 56.], "Thou 
Canaanite kind, and not Judah," because he follows its 
customs. It is known that the Amorites and the Hittites 
have disappeared. Canaan, that is, the Jewish people, 
which is equal in guilt and in vices, will be made equal to 
them in punishment, it will be made nothing. 


And all those who collect money are wiped out. 


He again interprets how it is made to nothing; it is 
pounded in the mortar. He shows the avarice of riches, 
that they direct all their striving toward riches. 


At the same time | will search Jerusalem with 
lanterns, and | will visit the people who are lying on 
their heels.

Defixos, that is, clotted. He still continues and makes 
great the crushing and the taking [of the city]. | will 
search this city so that not one will be left to escape my 
wrath. In a mortar, one cannot well escape the pestle. 
[He is] "so wise, you cannot hit his head in the mortar," 
is a proverb. - "Those who lie on their heels," [that is, all 
whom | shall find in Jerusalem, | will bring into captivity. 
[I will afflict] the people who lie on their lees, that is, who 
have become rigid, hardened on their lees. In a 
vituperative manner, he calls their righteousnesses and 
opinions "yeasts." He does not dignify them with the 
name of a wine or drink otherwise used in Scripture for 
a doctrine 2c. The yeast is the last thing in the barrel 2c. 
Is. 7, 4. calls the two 1) kings "two smoking fires of fire". 
Scornfully he calls them "a stocking". 2) There is nothing 
left but that they smoke, they will soon turn to ashes. 
Here he indicates that they are very close to captivity 
and that they are the yeast of the people and shall be 
utterly destroyed. These | will afflict, who are hardened 
in their opinions 2c. 


Which are on their yeasts. 

That is, holding to their tenets 2c. [hold fast]. The 
following text compels to this view. As if to say, | am 
among them like a fool and a Thor; they think that | 
speak of a foolish God and not of the true 2c. "Tell thy 
God to hang up his grace." Scornfully they mock him, 
therefore, irritated, he attacks them ignominiously. So 
utterly certain are they in their hearts: thy GOt can 
neither save nor destroy, as if to say: the GOt whom 
Zephaniah preaches is not the true GOt, because he 
prophesies against the promises 2c. "We have" from 
your GOtte "nothing good", also nothing evil 2c. Our God 


will preserve us well. Defixos means:] who have grown 
fat, full of confidence and puffed up in their security, 
firmly convinced, sure.

V. 13. And their goods shall become plunder. 


He describes the devastation, he describes the 
visitation of the people who lie on their heels, which will 


be like this: Their "strength" (fortitudo), that is, their 
possessions, their wealth, their riches, will be shattered, 
as goods are wont to be shattered. They will be 
devastated who say that the Lord does neither good nor 
evil, 3) that is, he is nothing, as if to say, My Lord will do 
this. They shall be desolate, they shall become a spoil 
2c. They sit securely on their heels; however much they 
[the prophets also] cry out, nothing is accomplished; they 
build as if they wanted to remain on the earth forever, 
they plant - see the words of Christ [Luc. 17, 28 ff.] 4) - 
as if they would live forever. Paul says [1 Thess. 5, 3.], 
"When they shall say, There is peace, there is no danger 
[, then destruction shall speedily overtake them"]. 5) He 
says that then destruction is most imminent when 
everything is in the highest bloom, when things are going 
exceedingly well 2c. God does nothing else in this world 
than to raise them up so that they may be overthrown. 
Since thou hast exalted them, thou hast made them a 
mockery, says the Psalm. 6) He plays with the affairs of 
men, as it were, as on a scales. At the time when the 
Babylonian captivity was imminent, 7) there was peace 
and security; they build, they plant to it, that. calamity 


come and destroy all. Magnisque negatum stare diu 
[great things are denied to last long 1) says Lucan. They 
are safe, but the Chaldean will come and destroy, and 
they will not long abide in these things. - Easily it is in the 
indicative: they plant 2c.

This is what is said against the hopeful opponents 
and despisers. They say, he is not only 1) not near, but 
also, it is nothing with it. He is moved by this foolish 
certainty and contradicts. That is why he urges with such 
vehement words: He will come as soon as possible, "is 
at the door". So it is always [Ps. 55, 24]: "The wicked do 
not bring their life to the half", 2) always the misfortune 
comes to them suddenly and unexpectedly. Christ says 
[in the parable] of the servant [Luc. 12, 46.]: ["The Lord] 
will come when he does not understand." For the wicked 
do not believe, they remain secure against all divine 
threats. It is not necessary that it [the day] should come 
suddenly; nothing is sudden to the children who believe, 
but it is for their profit. The wicked always hope for the 
best and fear nothing; the opposite happens to them. In 
Isaiah it says of the Babylonian empire: | will not see its 
destruction 2c. The prophet scoffs 2c. Human nature 
cannot fear misfortune for the sake of prosperity; it does 
not know how close to happiness misfortune is. The 
flesh does not believe; it fears nothing less than 
misfortune. It is very near and hastens; it does not "wait" 
long, [it will] "come soon". 3) 


4) When the cry of the Day of the Lord will come. 


The voice of those who cry out, who mourn and weep 
in the day of the Lord. He imagines, as if it had already 
happened, that the little people were already in captivity. 
He imagines that the whole people laments in the 
bitterest way 2c. He 


obvious that the words: xropo 68t this, props st oolor uimi.8 are only 
another expression of v. 14. in the Vulgate: duxta 68t di68 Domini 
rnnAnné, juxtn 68t 6t volox niini8. - Instead of the second propo, the 
Erlanger and the Weimarsche have: xroxor. 

1) Our template offers: non propo non 6886 diennt. We have 
assumed according to the Hall manuscript non 8oiurn xropo oto. 

2) In the original supposedly: divi, which both the Erlanger and the 
Weimarsche have supplemented to divinant. We have assumed 
dimidiant with the Hall manuscript. The Altenburger has dirnidinbunt 
according to the Vulgate. 

3) The last words in our original are: "non wart Inniturn, coming 
soon". 

4) It is only here that the Weimar has the verse number "14." 





speaks of the day of captivity, not of the last day. He 
uses great words; he has reason to do so because he 
speaks against the unbelievers. 


Then the strong will cry out bitterly. 
This is the shouting that will be heard on that day. 5) 


Tribulari [in the Vulgate] means [according to the 
Hebrew] to shout loudly. So say the Hebrew linguists; | 
do not understand it sufficiently. There the strong will 
shout aloud. The strong warriors, the heroes, the great 
ones, who before were to be feared by all and were 
invincible, will not only cry out, but will cry out loudly, for 
it is a day of bitterest weeping. Not only the people will 
cry out, but these warriors and the strongest will cry out 
louder than the rest of the people. Why? 


V. 15. For this day is a day of wrath. 


This is said with reference to the Babylonian captivity. 
6) The prophet makes it great so that he may frighten 
the hardened and foolish people. He sets it before eyes 
to soften the hearts; but this does not happen. 


[A day of weather and boisterousness.] 


This calamitatis et miseriae [in the Vulgate] "is not 
right" [, it should read]: "a day of weather". Lucas in the 
Evangelio [Cap. 21, 25.] says: "The waves of water will 
roar", as it happens with a storm. Sprichw. 3, 7) 25. it 
means the rushing and surging floods [: "That thou 
mayest not fear sudden terror, nor the tempest of the 
wicked". Ps. 65, 8. it means the waves of the sea, which 
give their noise full, a dull roar. A day of noise and floods 
or roaring sea. He wants to indicate that the Babylonians 
will come with impetuosity, as when the sea surges with 
the wind 2c. Rather: "of the weather and impetuosity”. 


5) These words are drawn in our submission to the previous 
section. 

6) The Erlanger reads inulti, the Weimarsche duoti; we have 
assumed diota. 

7) In the original: Drovord. 4. Perhaps Sprtichw.

') A day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and 
fog. 

He describes this day as a day of storm: it "thunders" 
very hard; "lightning", black air, thick clouds. 


V. 16. A day of trumpets and drums. 


Of the sounding [of trumpets) or shouting on the part 
of the Chaldeans, who will stand ready with their 
trumpets as valiant warriors and certain of victory. "There 
shall be heard a sound of sounding and blowing," 2c. so 
that ye might die by the voice of the adversaries; it will 
be a very mournful day. This army of the Chaldeans the 
Lord will bring in, that it may be a trumpet among you. All 
things will look exceedingly miserable; the strong cities 
will not profit you, not even Jerusalem. 


2) Against the solid cities and high castles. 


XuZulo8, that is, the towers, the fortifications in which 
you trust. So great will be the impetuosity that no 
fortification can resist. 


V. 17. | will make people anxious (tribulabo). 


| do not understand this word [XXXj]. [I give it:) | will 
sound among men or with men, "I will also let myself be 
heard; field cry," that is, | will be the leader in war and 
will cause a field cry among men 2c., put fear into the 
heart of men, so that they may realize that this is done 
by men because God wills it. First he takes away 
courage; when that is gone, even a leaf in the forest is a 
trumpet 2c. And again, if the heart is courageous, then 
everything outwardly is also strong 2c. 


That they should walk around like the blind. 


He indicates what he wanted, namely the 
despondency of the heart. They cannot make up their 
minds whether to ask for peace 2c. They will be in 
dismay around- 


1) Already here, the Weimar has the verse number "16." 
2) Already here, the Weimar has the verse number "17." 





Like the blind who do not know where to seek help or 
what to do. When the courage is gone, the eyes are 
blind, the ears do not hear, the heart is without counsel 
2c. Then | will give them a sense of sin; now they are 
hardened. Then they will see that they have sinned, 
because sin will make them dismayed, that they will go 
about like the blind. - "Because they have sinned against 
the Lord." That is, they will feel that they have sinned, 
and this will make them dismayed and fearful. 


Their blood shall be shed as if it were dust (humus). 


The ancient text has had humus [not fumus], 
excavated earth that can be scattered like ashes and 
dust. The one who translated like this probably hit it. 
Adam is created out of an earthen lump [Gen.2, 7.].Or it 


is limus, "loose earth," when a grave or trench is dug. 
Often it is translated by dust, as [Gen. 3, 19. Vulg.]: 
Remember, man, "that you are dust" 2c. 


And her body as if it were dung. 


So Paul says [Phil, 3, 8.]: "| consider everything as 
dirt." He wants to say: They will realize that they have 
sinned, therefore they will be fearful and will not know 
what to do. Although they will strive to propitiate God 
through sacrifice, they will accomplish nothing. s "Blood" 
stands for the flesh of the sacrificed animals, as Ps. 16:4: 
"| will not offer their libation with the blood, nor take their 
name in my mouth," so that "blood" stands for the 
sacrifice. That is, the sacrifices with which they offer 
libations and make atonement to GOD will not be 
pleasant, but will be spilled by the enemies. It will not be 
sprinkled with the finger, as in Moses [3rd book, 4, 6.], 
but they will be scattered like dust when the enemies 


come. [Instead of Corpora it should read] escas, bread 


or flesh. Actually, [XXXX] lechim is bread. These

The food of the Lord was offered to the priests, as we 
read in the third book of Moses. It also means not only 
meat nor bread, but food, as [Ps. 78, 25/: "angel bread" 


(escam angelorum). Set against it the water and the 
drink; that is, give drink and food. Food, that is, their 
sacrifices, which were the food of the priests, will not now 
please, 1) but will be rejected. And this will not only be 
outward, but so will the consciences feel. Because they 
will not please, they will be taken for dung. Hosea says 
[Cap. 9, 4.]: Their bread is the bread of the afflicted. Of 
the bread of the sacrifice one was not allowed to eat [in 
mourning/, that is, their services are in mourning. 
According to Deut. 26, 14. it was not permitted to offer 
the bread of the afflicted, that is, which was offered in 
time of mourning, that is, the sacrifices will not be 
pleasant and will not propitiate [him]. With this Paul 
agrees [Phil. .], 8.], "| count all things as filth." Because 
they feel that they have sinned, so their conscience 
stands

They do not think that God is 2c. But they are obvious to 
God, he looks very hopeful. The righteousnesses of the 
law are dung and dust, therefore faith in the word of God 
is required 2c. Their piety, their worship will not avail

v.18. Their silver and gold will not save them. 


It is not the wrath of men, but the divine wrath. Their 
gold will be of no use to them, therefore there is no help 
for them anywhere, because the Chaldeans will not 
respect gold 2c. - "The fiery", the inflamed wrath, you will 
not be able to mitigate it. The sacrifices will not be able 
to mitigate the wrath of GOD, the gold cannot appease 
the Chaldeans, therefore [the fire of the zeal of HErri/ will 
consume the whole land, that is, Judea. Instead of 


omnis [in the Vulgate], it would be better to say "the 
whole land." For "the end" will come suddenly or

One expression is in Hebrew, "Gather, and come

hate, never of love.

V. 2 [Before the judgment (jussio) goes out 
(pariat.)]. 


Some Kligling has added ViSiO [face] in the margin. 


It is neither Beseht jussio) nor face. It is a judgment, 
pronouncement, a decision, Ps. 2, 6. f. [: "wise" 


(praeceptum)). According to this judgment the thing 
must be executed. The expression stands for ceremonial 
laws. "Before the judgment goes out," that is, before the 
judgment itself is put into effect. The judgment has 
already been passed on you; only the execution remains, 


which he calls the birth (partum) of the judgment. (| 
would have been good,) 1) if the Latin interpreter had 
translated thus: Before the judgment brings forth the day 
itself. 


That you, like the chaff by day, pass by. 


"The day," that is, the time when the Babylonian king 
will come. - "Like the chaff," that is, that is violently carried 
away by the whirlwind, Ps. 1:4. This is frequent in 
Scripture, as in Job [Cap. 21:18.], "They shall be lik 
stubble." The punishments of the wicked are wont to be| 
thus described. - "By day," that is, in the day appointed 
by Him; that is, ye shall be scattered, as "chaff" is| 
scattered, as Ps. 1:4, by the king of Babylon. This is an 
exhortation that they should hasten repentance. 


Before the day of the Lord's wrath comes upon you. 


This [antequam non veniat] is a Hebrew way of 
speaking, but it is better to read in an affirmative way: 
"until", before the day of the Lord's wrath comes (before; 
the wrath). It is not enough that you have come together, 
make your coming together not in vain. When you have 
decided what must be decided, do what must be done. 
This is what you will do in your assembly 2c. 


V. 3. Seek the Lord, all you wretched of the land. 


Mansueti, "wretched," the lowly, who are oppressed 
and nothing with the world, as Mary sang [Luc. 1, 48.);

worthy of respect. Christ comes from an ass, for he is 
oppressed, lowly, without splendor, without glory, 
without riches. You who are lowly in the land of Judah, 
seek what is the Lord's, seek what is ordained in the law 
of God. 


Which you hold his rights. 


That is, there are still some of you left who are humble 
and do not seek high things, 2) come forth, admonish 
the others and draw them to your opinion. 


Seek righteousness, seek humility. 


He insists on humility before other virtues, because 
he knows that God looks at the lowly, that is, at the 
oppressed, the rejected. Take this to humble yourselves 
before God, you who have brought about captivity 
through hopefulness and injustice. 


That you may be hidden in the day of the Lord's 
wrath. 


"That you may be hidden", that is, that you may be 
protected. He continues as if the captivity is irrevocable. 
Pray that the Lord will protect you until the captivity is 
over. Thus Job says [Cap. 14:13], "Alas, that thou 
shouldest cover me and harden me." [Pray that you may 
obtain some mercy, that you may experience the 
captivity only as individuals. 


v. 4. For Gaza must be abandoned. 


He makes a conclusion of the strength. It was a 
miracle and always is that this small nation of the 
Philistines, five cities, could always resist the kingdom of 
Judah and Israel 2c.; only once has it been defeated, so 
warlike and strong was it. The captivity will be so 
rampant that it will include not only you Jews but also 
the neighboring cities 2c. There is a beautiful play on 
words in Hebrew 2c. Gaza will be deserted, even 
Ascalon will be deserted 2c.

will become desolate. 


Asdod is to be expelled at noon. 

A wonderful addition: "at noon"; perhaps it is an 
allusion. They will drive it out in noon, push it out. Jerome: 
in open light. Not with cunning and deceit, but in open 
combat they will take it, not being able to resist it, but only 
resisting it. But | dare not do this. 


And acaron be rooted out. 


Akaron is extermination, as if to say: you will be 
exterminated in truth; as the name, so will the thing be. 


V. 5: Woe to those who live by the sea (funiculum| 
maris). 

For | will destroy thee, that there shall be no 
inhabitant. Woe to those "who dwell by the cord of the 
sea" is a Hebrew phrase. It denotes distribution and 
measurement. In Joshua, the land was divided by cords 
[Cap. 17:5, 19:9]. Likewise it is said in Moses “5. book, 
32, 9.]: "But Jacob is the cord of the Lord", “that means 
a part or the allotted portion. Thus he calls the Philistines 
the cord of the sea, because their possession, namely 
that of those five cities, lay on the sea. But the port is 


Joppa 2c. - You who are a nation full of lost people (gens 
perditorum - "the warriors"), who are to be destroyed o 
exterminated. One thinks that the Cretans are 
designated by it, but it is not true. 

You Canaan, the land of the Philistines. 


| call you Canaan in the land of the Philistines. The} 
Amorites were on the other side of the Jordan, the 
Canaanites on this side. The land of the Philistines was 
Canaan. 


V. 6. 1) There shall be vain shepherds’ houses

miserably", in appellative meaning; as proper name it is 
the name of a city. Here it denotes dwellings of 
shepherds, as they dwell in deserts, not in cities, that 
they may have pasture for the sheep and the flocks. The 
land is joyful when it abounds in crops and livestock; it is 
not beautiful when they are not there 2c. Dwellings of the 
lambs, the sheep, the shepherds, and flocks. The people 
of the Philistines were hitherto invincible to Judah, but 
the captivity shall be so great that they shall also be 
carried away captive, that none shall dwell there 2c. Now 
those with the common name are called Arabs, who 
were once Ammonites, Moabites 2c. The people is as it 
were a heap gathered together, and [the cities] are never 
rebuilt, and scarcely remain in ruins; they lie desolate. 
They will be dwellings for the lambs of the shepherds 
and hurdles for the sheep, and so it will be the 
inheritance for the remnant of the house of Judah; 2) 
they will feed on it. 


V. 7. In the evening they are to encamp in the 
houses of Ascalou. 


Requiescent, that is: they will camp. This is how it will 
happen: This kingdom will be so degraded that where 
kings have been, there shall now be hurdles 2c. 


Funiculus, that is, the part of the tribe, the remnant of 
the tribe of Judah. In the places of the Philistines where 
Ascalon was before 2c. - "Of the evening." It indicates 
the custom of the shepherds: in the morning they lead 
the cattle to pasture, in the evening they lead them back 
2c. 


[Now when the LORD their GOd has afflicted them 
again.] 

As much as the prophets insist on the captivity, they 
always have their eye on the kingdom of Christ. For the 
sake of this kingdom, the captive people were to return, 
or at least the remaining ones in part. From this little 
spark a more glorious and greater kingdom was to be 
awakened, and Jechaniah came out of the dungeon to 
the table.

of the king, that he might be a lamp [Ps. 132:17]. There 
was always someone on the throne of David, whom God 
had chosen and appointed, until Christ came 2c. But 
wonderfully the promise was kept, which had to stand 
firm. Jechaniah was, as it were, the end of David's 
kingdom, and yet he was preserved to spread Christ's 
future kingdom over the whole world. - "When he hath 
afflicted them." He will deal mercifully with them. This is 
said for the comfort of the godly, that they might be sure 
that they should be restored to their land, because they 
had the promise. They must be protected according to 
the promise 2c., even if not all, but a part and the rest. 
Now he continues to the other side and toward the 
morning. He stands, his face turned toward the morning, 
as before toward the evening; "they must also be kept. 


V. 8. | have heard the reproach of Moab and the 
blasphemy of Ammon. 


These two nations were very hostile to the Jews, they 
persecuted them with the most ardent hatred, as the 
Psalm "By the Waters of Babel" 2c. [Ps. 137] shows. All 
the neighboring nations wished for happiness when 
something evil happened to the Jews. As if to say, They 
mock my people. All this | have heard, be silent, 
vengeance is mine. | know what they have reviled 
against my people. 


And on the same borders have boasted. 


Not as if they had taken the land of the Jews. "To 
boast" is always to exalt oneself and boast with great 
words. When my people were led into captivity, that 
people rejoiced and shouted, Behold, "is this the holy 
city?" 2c., as it is said in the Klaglieder of Jeremiah [Cap. 
2, 15.]. That is, they boasted great things, they exulted in 
the fall of Judah, that it was captive. They rejoice in the 
misfortunes of others, but vengeance will not fail; | will 
avenge you most abundantly. 


V. 9. Moab shall become like Sodom, 


The equation does not refer to all pieces, because it 
is not due to sulfur and 


Fire 2c. As an example these cities are mentioned in 
Isaiah [Cap. 1, 9] and in Jeremiah [Cap. 23, 14]. 1) As 
Sodom and Gomorrah ceased to be a kingdom, "brought 
nothing of it," in this Moab will be the same, so that 
nothing shall be left. Not as if it should be a salt sea and 
be destroyed by fire and brimstone. What has happened 
is this: the Persians and the Medes have so wrecked this 
nation that there was nothing left of the kingdom. Here 
the land will be uncultivated, so that thorns and nettles 
will grow in it, and salty regions or places will be in it. Ps. 
[107, 34. Vulg.], "Who turneth the land into a salt desert." 
Thus he calls a barren land, which is worked in vain, 
which pours forth no blessing 2c. 


Yes, like a nettle bush and saltgruve. 


In siccitatem spinarum [to a drought of thorns] or 


nettles, that is, to an arid place where thorns and nettles 
grow, and where there is no fatness nor any ability to 


bring forth anything. - Desertum, a wasteland. 
And the rest of my people shall rob them. 


Who will return from captivity. This happened in the 
time of the Maccabees, when the kingdom of Moab was 
nothing but robbers and people thrown together. - 


Diripient s "they shall rob them"). Not as if the Jews had 
ever taken the whole kingdom, but Moab shall be made 
nothing in such a way that the remnant 2) [of Judah] shall 


take it, and the rest of the Gentiles. And it is [residui 


gentis] 3) not the Jews, but the Medes, the Persians. 
Thus it shall become a spoil to all nations, among whom 
shall be my people. It will be given "into rapus." In the 
calamity [of my people] they have gloriously boasted and 
reviled my people 2c.

The Lord, after returning from Babylon, certainly 
made the temple at Jerusalem more famous than the one 
Solomon built. The one after Solomon was more famous 
than the one before. Apost. 2, 1) 5: "Out of all the people 
that are under heaven" 2c. The prelude of the kingdom 
of Christ begins here under Jeshua and Zerubbabel. The 
apostles did not find the world empty, for out of all kinds 


of people people came to Jerusalem to the temple. < ) 


Attenuavit [he has made enough]. He does not say he 
has destroyed, he has done away. - They will worship 
him in spirit and in truth, who has made his word known 
over all the earth. - "All the islands" as far as Rome. He 
understands the islands of the Mediterranean Sea, as 
Creta was 2c. They offered their gifts in the temple at 
Jerusalem 2c. 


V. 12. 3) Also, you Moors shall be slain by my

["By my sword",] which the king of Babylon will wield

Jews, the chosen people, then the neighboring 
Philistines toward evening, then toward morning Moab 
and the Ammonites. Now he threatens the Moors at 
noon, finally we will hear how he threatens at midnight, 
like Jeremiah. [Cap. 25, 15.] says of the cup 2c. As if to 
say, Behold, | will not spare my people, much less the 
neighboring nations, which are ungodly. And so he 
subjects all the nations to the wrath of God and to 
desolation. Not only his people, but also the Gentiles 2c.; 
they will perish with them. He begins to punish His 
people, 1 Petr. 4, 17. First He crucifies His martyrs; when 
that is finished, a greater wrath against the persecutors 
soon comes. We can now give an example of this: first 
we will be afflicted, then they will perish at the hands of 
the enemy.

V. 13. 4) And he will stretch out his hand over 
midnight, and destroy Assyria. He will make Nineveh 
desolate, dry as a desert (et invium quasi desertum). 


Instead of INVIUM it should rather be "the ships". The 
Hebrew word is ambiguous: ships and waterless. The 
inconsistency of the text forces that "ships" be put, 
because the impassable is already a desert. "Nineveh," 
which is a very populous city 2c. So also the rivers, as 
the Tigris, the Euphrates, so the sea cities, which are 
situated at the rivers, which had many ships, harbors, 
fords, - | will make them a desert, and | will make them 
so a desert, that in the midst of it the armies of all

V. 14: That all kinds of beasts among the Gentiles 
will be encamped inside. 
He is talking about the animals of that region, which is 
located in the desert 2c., both wild and tame. Animals of 
every kind of that people. There will be pastures where 
before there were great cities. Moreover, [here] he also 
calls the onocrotalus ["bittern"], a bird that announces 
the springtime, 5) which dips its beak into the water and 


makes a muffled sound, "water pumb." 6) In liminibus

which runs easily 2c. [There] it is an appellative word, 
but actually it is a proper noun 2c. With the words, which 
mean things, we remain stuck, we cannot be certain. 
After those cities are destroyed, night birds will surely

the Assyrian, so of the kingdom of Israel: one king dwelt 
here, another there. They visited different places, so that 
Babylon and Assyria are one kingdom; the residences 
were changed. In the book of Judith [Cap. 1, 6. 2,1.] 
Nebucadnezzar is called the king of Assyria, although he 
was the king of Babylon 2c. 





V. 15. This is the joyful city that dwelt so securely. 


Confidenter, "sure". They are mocked: behold, is

mighty kingdom? Gloriosa, is not so much as: who has 
a great glory, but boasttul, like the glorious man of war

cities in all the world 2c. But | will stretch out my hand 
over them. 


It is me, and no more. How it has become so 
desolate that the animals live inside! 


Cubile belongs to the predicate. How desolate it has 
become, and it, which used to be the most powerful city, 
has become a camp of animals; the kings do not inhabit 
it. Thus the wrath of God, after chastising His people, is 
wont to chastise the neighboring godless nations.

2) This third chapter, although it has been treated in

from the Babylonian captivity, when the kingdom was 
restored and had prophets and Christian scholars, that 
is, those Pharisees 2c. He describes the leadership of 
the Jewish people between the coming of Christ and the 
Babylonian captivity. Then he deals with the kingdom of 
Christ and the Roman captivity, and again he threatens 
the desolation of the whole world after the gospel has 
been despised. However, first he describes the coming 
of Christ. He sees that because of ungodliness the rebuilt 
Jerusalem will have to be destroyed again, and that the 
kingdom will be spread to the whole world, and because 
of 


2) A gloss; which is repeated at v. 1, we have omitted here. 





The whole world will be devastated because of the 
contempt of the gospel 2c. Thus the world, because it 
despises the word, fills the earth with blood. After the 
word is preached, the godly are afflicted as it is now. 
Many are instructed, others despise and persecute it 2c. 
The word now flourishes, false prophets arise. Since this 
word is despised, we are sure that the world must be 
filled with murder and bloodshed. The world is world, the 
prince of the world cannot stand the word. Wherever the 
gospel is preached, it is certain that there will be a great 
battle 2c. Thus the prophet sees here that the restored 
synagogue must again be destroyed. Finally, Christ will 
come and scatter the ungodly, but gather the godly from 
the four wards 2c.

The whole content of this chapter is set forth by this 


word: redempta [v. 1. Vulg.], which is brought back from 
the Babylonian captivity. He punishes the disobedient 
city; by ungodliness it provokes God. Perverse doctrines 
and sects actually provoke and challenge God. 
Adulterers 2c. do not so challenge God, but rather their 
sins terrify the consciences. But those ungodlinesses 
make God a liar, they condemn His word. It is evil 
because one does not have the truth, and yet wants the 
truth and to be right. 


Columba [the city, the dove rather: of the dove or the 
doves. In the Song of Songs [Cap. 6, 8.] it is said, "One 
is my dove." The prophet indicates that he is speaking 
of Jerusalem, which city is the One and the Friend of 
GOD 2c. In Isaiah [Cap. 1, 21.] it is said, "How is it that 
the pious city has become a harlot?" Since it is endowed 
with the Spirit, it is the dove of God, "our Lord's organ of 
play.” It indicates that He is there in this city.

from captivity, she quickly fell away. She does not hear 
the prophets 2c. Soon after the Babylonian captivity, the 
Pharisees and Sadducees stood up. [She does not] 
obey the voice, that is, the word of GOD, does not want 
to be "wrong." Ps. 12:5, "Our tongue shall have the 
upper hand." They teach the flesh, the righteousness of 
works, not of faith, therefore GOD is irritated. "They

He does not speak of the kings [, but of the rulers], as

the first vice is avarice. He who does not trust in GOD 
trusts in mammon; he who has no hope in GOD has set 
his hope on gold. - "Roaring lions" who rob and tear the 
wretched people. The judges and officials are stingy, 
insatiable. In Habakkuk [Cap. 1, 8.] it is said of the king 
of the Chaldeans: his chariots 2c., "his horses are swifter 
than the wolves of the evening." [This is] the wolf of the 
desert or Arabia 2c. As if to say, In the evening they shall 
destroy all things, that in the morning there shall be 
nothing left. It is all the same whether one takes it as wolf 
of the desert or wolf in the evening. In one day they will 
consume everything, so that in the morning nothing is 
left. They are so stingy, that if they could take all the 
people today, there would be nothing left tomorrow. 
They are insatiable to take away everything so that 
nothing is left for others. 


V. 4. Their prophets are reckless. 


[Vesani, "reckless, loose knaves." Gen. 49, 4. This 
word is used of Reuben. [The Septuagint renders it by] 


spiritiferi, they are driven by every wind 2c. This is how 
Paul uses it in the letter to the Ephesians [Cap. 4, 14.] 
2c. "People who are dissolute," frivolous, who do not 
care; as it comes into their mouths, so they speak. [Gen. 
49, 4. Vulg.:] "Poured out" 2c., flowing easily "like water," 
without order, without a master. It is not held back, it is 
not gathered into a vessel, as the wind "flies along." Jer. 
23, 32. it should be instead of in mirudilidas suis [with its 
miracles].

rather: with their loose divisions. [They are “loose 
talkers, washers," they speak words in which there is no 
use, they have nothing well thought out. "Their prophets 


are frivolous," spiritiferi, that is, driven about by every 
wind. They are wind "that sweeps about" ("whoosh") and 
carries us away. They do not pay attention to how great 
a meaning the words of the Lord have, they teach them 
as if they were human statutes. Another example we 


have [Judg. 11, 3.) to Jephthah: he brought Vagos, that 
is, all the loose people together. Nothing less befits a 
teacher of the Word than to be reckless. He must be 
serious 2c., not like "Gaukler". Their prophets are very 
frivolous people and scorners, who consider the thing to 
be of no value, "scorners cast a thing to the winds", Ps. 
25, 3. who ‘take no heed to the word, but to their belly; 
therefore they speak frivolously 2c. 


Their priests desecrate the sanctuary. 
That is, the holy things, the temple, and what was in 
the temple. 


[And interpret the law freventlich.) 


They did not use it rightly, but treated it ungodly, as if 
by these things the people were justified. God wanted 
everything to be done in faith; they did violence to the 
law, they violated the law. This is what the godless 
teachers did, that they counterfeited the law. They did 
not treat the word of God in a spiritual way, but in a 
carnal way 2c. With godlessness in teaching they 
profaned the sanctuary, so that the people relied on the 
righteousness of the law, as is shown in the Gospel 
Matth. 15, 5: "He who speaks to his father or mother" 2c. 
They preferred the splendor of the righteousness of the 
flesh to true righteousness. The Pharisees were 
completely like this, as it says in the gospel Matth. 15, 
3]: You pervert the law and distort it with your 
interpretations. 


V. 5 But the Lord, who is among them, teaches 
rightly and does no evil. 


He speaks of Christ. He is true God, who teaches 
righteousness and does justice.

tivity. He comes in the midst of them, but as a righteous 
man he teaches and does what is right and constant. As 
if he wanted to say: So great is godlessness that it is a 
miracle when one finds godliness and righteousness. 
Christ came "when it was most grievous. 


He lets all the mornings teach his rights publicly. 


He wants to say: quickly and soon, "early", swiftly, in 
the morning, in the dawn, hurriedly, "before all things" 
2c. Those ungodly who rule in their ungodliness 2c.; it 
will not turn out that way, he will bring [his rights] to light, 
that is, they will be revealed. The Psalm says [Ps. 37:6], 
"He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light." The 
wicked will darken thy cause and bring it into darkness. 
Thus it will be preserved, 1) the LORD will succor and 
bring forth thy oppressed righteousness 2c., that is, he 
will make it glorious, known and famous, there will be no 
lack of him. It will not profit them that they strive with 
united strength, that it shall not come forth, but Christ 
shall tear through. 


But the bad people do not want to learn shame 2) 


[This is] as spoken of the HEART: He will bring forth 
his cause with his glory 2c. He will not hide, but break 
through, that is, he will not approve of shameful 
ungodliness. Ps. 1, 6.: "The LORD knows the way of the 
righteous." [Matth. 7, 23.:) "| have never known you," | 
have not approved of you. He will put to shame the 
unrighteousness that contends with his righteousness. 
He will let it pass and not acknowledge it, he will reject 
it, he will have no fellowship with its righteousness, "will 
reject it, will not accept it’.

1692 L. xxvil, 256-288. interpretation of Zephaniah (2.), Cap. 3, 6. 7. 


V. 6. Therefore | will cut off these people. 


He begins a taunt and an exhortation. "J'ch will cut 
off these people, that none shall pass through" is a new 
passage. He begins in this chapter to address his 
prophecy to the people brought back from Babylon, 
since some sinned not through idolatry, but through 
hypocrisy, as in the Gospel. And concerning this people, 
who were waiting for the coming of Christ, he foresaw 
that it would happen that godless people and hypocrites 
would be there, who would corrupt the people no less 
than once the false prophets with their idolatries. The 
Lord will find them out to be such people, and will begin 
to show them the benefits and his grace: | brought you 
back from the Babylonian captivity, and to do this | 
destroyed so many nations for your sake, the 
Babylonians and the Asfyrians, as once | did in Egypt, 
and all these things you forget. They sang his praises, 
but soon they fell away 2c. The wonders of GOD soon 
grow old 2c. Remember when we were in the Pabstium 
2c. 


| will lay waste their castles (et dissipati sunt anguli 
earum). 


"Their castles" (anguli - cornerstones), their princes, 
their heads. | have destroyed the principalities in these 
realms. It is a Hebrew way of speaking. In the second 
book of Mosi [Richt. 20, 2.) the princes of Israel are 
called cornerstones; elsewhere the foundation, the 
heads, the head, the hair, the beard; those who stand 
out before others, who are more glorious, respected by 
the people. 


And empty their alleys. 


For as a river is dried up by the very great heat of 
summer, so have | dried up her guests by my very great 
wrath. It is a picture: where the kingdom of the nations 
is now, the streets are full of those who walk on it 2c. He 
indicates that he will dry up these streams of people (as 
in summer [the rivers)). He interprets himself: "empty." 
Now there is a very numerous people in the gapes, and 
one walks as if there were a stream in the gapes. We 
see that. In the devastated cities (their cities 


1693 


have been abandoned, destroyed) the multitude of 
citizens has ceased, so has the multitude of houses; and 
for your sake | have done all these things. 


V.7. | said to you, "Fear me. 


| have commanded to be preached unto thee by my 
prophets. | have always been with you through the 
prophets, who were to say to you, "Fear me," since you 
saw my works and miracles, that | made the kingdoms 
desolate, 2c., so that you might learn to look to me, but 
immediately you forgot me. 


And let you be chastised, 


So that your dwelling will not be cut off. He means to 
say, lest thou commit similar things to the former ones 
for which 1) | have afflicted thee, lest | be compelled to 
destroy thee as before. Once | have scattered thee, or 
thy dwelling place; unless thou repent 2c. In short words, 
the prophet has grasped the whole Christian life. The 
fear of God includes everything that relates to God. The 
fear of God is faith, which is always present. Discipline 
belongs to the outward life; that one tames the body and 
serves the neighbor 2c. This is the summa of the 
preaching of all the prophets, as if to say: The Romans 
will destroy you because you will sin as before, as 
follows: 


But they are diligent (diluculo surgentes) to 
practice all kinds of wickedness. 


As if he wanted to say: | have remembered this in 
vain. "Early" is a word taken from the Psalter, "Where 
the Lord buildeth not the house" [Ps. 127:2]: "It is in vain 
that ye rise early." Above | said that "early" means 
quickly, hurriedly. "They will come to me early," says 
Hosea [Cap. 5, 15.), and Ps. 78, 34. "When he strangled 
them, they sought him, and turned to GOD early." They 
will not be forgiven, but will come in haste, that they may 
find mercy, just as they rose up early here and practiced 


their wickedness (COr- rupuerunt studia sua). In the 
14th Psalm, v. 2:

1694 L. XXVII, 258-260. interpretations on the prophets. 


1695 





"They are no good" 2c. (corrupti), are almost the 
same words. The opinion is: not only have they not 
heard the prophets, but moreover, they have rushed 
and been hot to exercise their wickedness. The 
doctrine of godlessness goes forward slowly 
because the flesh, the world and the devil resist, for 
the mud of many waters is in the way of godliness. 
The wicked advance on their way, they are wise and 
mighty to do evil. We are all weak in doing good. The 
children of the world [are wiser in their race than the 
children of light, Luc. 16:8], 1) whereas the children 
of light are equipped by the divine presence; yet they 
advance slowly. - "They practice wickedness." They 
have perverted both the opinions from faith and the 
outward life. Faith alone makes the outward life good; 
ungodliness corrupts all. And they are "unfit for faith," 
says Paul [2 Tim. 3:8.] 


V. 8 Therefore, says the Lord, you must wait for me 
again. 

He wants to say: In vain | remember, send my 
prophets 2c. Because they have degenerated again 
immediately after their return, and have adopted the 
customs of their fathers, and have forgotten the 
benefits, therefore | begin to be weary of them. 
Therefore | will not be king in Judea alone, but will go 
to other nations. | will provoke you on a people that 
is not holy 2c.; in the Song of Moses [5 Mos. 32, 2l.] 
it says: "on a foolish people". For you are an 
incorrigible people, therefore it will take a little while, 
and become different. The kingdom will be taken 
from you and given to the Gentiles 2c. [Matth. 21, 43.] 
We want to put an end to all these things, we want to 
let my kingdom and my people cease. 


Until | turn out in his time (ad diem resurrectionis meae in 
futurum). 

It is not resurrectionis [until the time of the 
resurrection], but | do not dislike it; it should rather be 
called surrectionis [since | make myself out. The first 
view that he 


1) Added by us. 


When he speaks of the resurrection of Christ from 
the dead, | do not dislike that he darkly reproaches it, 
as if he wanted to say: | am tired of this people: | will 
make a new one, and this will happen through the 
power of my resurrection from the dead. And this first 
conception agrees with me very well. The other view 
is, if we take surgere [arise] generally, the word which 
the Scripture [uses, as, Ps. 9, 20.: "Lord, arise"], 2) 
when he begins to visit, as, since he arose by the 
Romans, and visited and desolated. Thou shalt be 
remembered in vain, | will one day stand out against 
thee, and utterly destroy thee, and raise up a new 
nation. "I will come upon you suddenly one day and 
destroy you," says Exodus 33:5. Jerome and the 
translators "have prepared a great feast for 
themselves. If | will make myself out again after this, 
"so hit dich". The former opinion pleases me better, 
because that standing out was the end of this whole 
people and the beginning of a new one. 


Since | will also be right, and gather the Gentiles. 


Here you see of what resurrection he says, by 
which the whole world will be opened or is opened, 
and all the Gentiles will be called to the kingdom of 
Christ. | will judge the whole world,” says the Lord, 
"because Christ has ascended to heaven through the 
resurrection and has become a judge. [Ps. 110:6:] 
"He will judge among the Gentiles,” that is, he will 
assume the office of judgment, that is, the power to 
rule. "Judgment" here does not mean the execution 
of judgment, but the office of judge. Ps. 1, 5., likewise 
[Ps. 7, 7.]: Arise, and execute the judgment which 
thou hast commanded, give me again the power to 
rule, and such a power that | may gather the Gentiles 
2c. This was done through the preaching of the 
gospel. For he ascended that he might fulfill all 
things. 


And the kingdoms throng.

1697 





To pour out my wrath upon them, all the wrath of my 
fury. 


Paul interprets this in the letter to the Romans with round 
words [Cap. 1, 17. 18.]: "Because in it [in the gospel] is 
revealed the righteousness that is valid before God, for 
God's wrath from heaven is revealed against all ungodly 
beings" 2c. For the voice of the gospel is this [Matt. 3:2, 
4:17], "Repent." "Repentance had to be preached in his 
name," Luc. 24, 47. Preaching repentance is nothing else 
than preaching wrath: Ye are all sinners and under wrath 
2c. And so, through this voice of the gospel, wrath comes 
to all the ends of the earth. "I will gather the Gentiles," 
and how? It is not destruction, and yet he says that wrath 
shall be poured out upon them. The prophets in Micah 
[Cap. 2, 6.] are called tearers; ["tear," that is, threaten a 
little. Here all the fury is poured out, because by the 
gospel all the thunder and flood of his wrath is poured 
out. [Marc. 16, 16.:] "He that believeth not shall be 
damned"; there is all the wrath. There is nothing left of 
wrath: that | may humble and convert them: for he is in 
his zeal fire kindled, declaring wrath. Rom. 5, 9. "So 
rather shall we ever be kept from wrath through him, 
having been justified by his blood." As if it were already 
there at this moment, it is poured out in the meantime by 
the word, which is followed by wrath itself, because at the 
moment of death it will seem as if the whole world is 
burning, as the prophet urges us from all sides to 
understand this in front of the gospel. He arranges his 
threats in such a way that we cannot understand it from 
the disturbance of the kingdom. Here he says that he 
wants to make the lips different 2c. This text is therefore 
clearly about the gospel. Therefore, the pouring out of 
wrath is none other than that which is done through the 
Word, as Rom. 1:18 says. 


V. 9. Then | will preach differently to the peoples 
HA friendly lips (Vertam ad populum labium purum vel electum 
etc.). 


He wants to say: | want these people who are diligent to 
practice all kinds of wickedness, that is, the ver-. 





Take away from your midst the false ones of the Word of 
God. | will gather for myself a people who will have pure 
lips, people who will teach the pure word and live purely. 
These are words of promise and grace, and yet words of 
threat are added: | will make different (vertam), not: | will 
restore (reddam [Vulg.]). Now you have “unclean lips," 
as it is said above in Isaiah [Cap. 6, 5-7.]: an angel came 
and touched my mouth 2c. These lips are spoken of 
here. [Instead of labium electum in the Vulgate] read: 
pure or clean lips, that is, for the unclean lips, which are 
corrupted by false opinions, which do not teach purely, | 
will give such as are pure, which teach the pure and 
unpolluted word of God. 


That they may all call upon the name of the Lord. 

All who have these pure lips will have this fruit, that 
they can call upon the name of God. A glorious text! 
Where sincere faith is not taught, the invocation of God 
is not taught. After the sincere faith is taught, the sincere 
invocation of God follows. See Rom. 10, 14. When one 
has the sincere word, this causes him to call upon the 
name of the Lord. 


And serve him with one accord (humero uno). 


[Humero uno,] that is, with one accord; they shall not 
limp on either side. Thus Elijah [1 Kings 18:21] rebuked 
his own. Partly they served the Lord, partly the devil. God 
does not want to be worshipped with a limp, but wants to 
be served with one accord, that is, each one should have 
the same mind as the other. 


V. 10: They will bring me my worshippers, namely 
the scattered ones from beyond the water in the land 
of the Moors, as a gift. 

Here he indicates the fruit of the gospel, that this 
people will be abandoned and another will be adopted. 
Now my power, my judgment will extend far. The word 
will run, so that it will not come to the neighboring 
Gentiles alone, but go out into all lands 2c. "Beyond the 
waters" [will bej people who worship and call upon me. 
Therefore 


1698 L. XXVIL, 262-264. interpretations on the prophets. 


1699 





my church will not only be in Jerusalem, there will also be 
worshippers in the land of the Moors, although it was not 
permitted to worship anywhere else but in Jerusalem. But 
the time is coming 2c. Joh. 4, 21. 23. - "One will bring 
here." Not only in Jerusalem will sacrifices be made, but 
everywhere where my Christians will be scattered. It will 
be a new way of praying, therefore that old use of 
sacrifice will cease. He therefore pronounces it with 
round words that the old testament shall be done away 
with and a new one shall be established. This cannot be 
understood otherwise than by spiritual sacrifices. At 
Jerusalem there was an outward service, 1) the spiritual 
children have a pure sacrifice, that is, [we sacrifice] 
ourselves, as it is said in the Epistle to the Hebrews 
ARom. 12, Il -c. 


The dispersed (filii dispersorum). 2) 


Peter says 1 Petr. 1, 1.:""To the chosen strangers back 
and forth" (aispsrsis), which he took from the prophet, 
because the Christians are scattered throughout the 
world. They do not come together like the Jews who 
gathered in Jerusalem, so it will be a different sacrifice, 
which does not happen because the whole multitude is 
gathered. 


V.11. At that time you will no longer be ashamed of 
everything you have done. 


For | will take away your iniquities. He will say, | will 
purify my people, | will have true saints, and so there will 
be no hypocrisy or corruption of the word, because of 
which there was reproach, and wherewith they sinned 
against the Lord. | will not only forgive thee, but also give 
thee the Spirit, that there be no [proud saints] among thee 
2c. "I will put them away from you" is how the prophet 
interprets himself. This was 3) thy shame, which was 
reproached against thee, that thou hadst priests, after 
whom thine ears itched, which had not pure lips. 


1) Here we have added the word eultus to externus. Immediately 
following, instead of Ulii Uispersionis in the Weimar, and ,Miae 
spiritualis in the Erlanger, we have assumed: Ulii spirituales. 

2) Instead of this reading of the Vulgate, the Erlanger has: "ilia 
aisperssoruiL’*", and the Weimarsche: Ulia Uispersionis. 

3) Instead of erit in our template, we have adopted ernt. 


For | will do the proud saints from you. 


The old translator has: magniloquos “that speak 
great things | do not dislike; that is, who extol the 
righteousness of the flesh and of works. For | will give 
pure lips, which declare wrath upon all people. We are 
taught to despair of what is ours. "Where then is the 
glory? He is out," Rom. 3:27. | will give you teachers who 
will teach you the wrath of GOD and your sins, then you 
will stop boasting about works and your righteousness. - 
"The proud," for he speaks spitefully against the 
righteousness of the flesh; he calls it our hope. And so 
he has decreed all things under sin, "that every mouth 
might be stopped up, and all the world guilty to God" 
[Rom. 3:19.]. "Let the isles be silent before me," says 
Isaiah [Cap. 41, 1. Let him who wishes to boast boast in 
the Lord [Jer. 9, 24]; let him humble himself in his sins 
and ascribe glory to God alone. 


V. 12. | will leave in you a poor little people. 


"| will leave the apostles and the remnant of Israel. 
The fat ones of the people | will take away, 4) the select 
and. Great ones, who persecute the people and resist 
the word, do not hear 2c. After the hopeful people are 
rejected, | will accept the poor who believe the word to 
be true and "trust in the Lord." He describes his church 
as being a poor people 2c. Those who are not so 
constituted are not the church. Although they are within 
the church, they are not of the church, it is the excrement 
in the body, not something of the body, that is, it does 
not belong to the body, is dung 2c. Thus the saints are 
the church, even though it still has excrement and dung 
in it. Faith is the highest worship. 


V. 13: The rest of Israel will do no evil. 


These are the virtues of faith, its power and 
effectiveness. It is true that the whole

Israel are rejected, but those who are not [likewise] 

2c., because they trust in the Lord. For [1 John 3:9] 

"he that is born of God doth not sin," that is, the 

believers who are born of God. By those who are born 

of God are indicated those who believe in His name. 
Still talking wrong. 

They will not preach hypocritical works next to the 
truthful and blameless word - "And one will not find in 
their mouth a deceitful tongue", which under a 
beautiful pretense deceives the souls, teaching 
something else [namely righteousness], and giving 
something else, namely death. 


But they shall feed and rest without all fear. 

They shall be shepherded, that is, with the gospel. 
They will rest in peace; in good conscience they will 
fear neither sin, nor death, nor the devil. Rom. 5, I. it 
says: "Now that we have been justified by faith, we 
have peace with God"; there is nothing that can 
frighten. [Rom. 8, 31.:) "If GOD is for us, who can be 
against us?" They are kings over all kings. This is the 


1701 


If a person recognizes the benefits of Christ, he 
cannot help but rejoice and wish for happiness and 
give thanks, so he rejoices in the Lord. Here you see 
that he is not talking about a temporal kingdom, 
because Israel never returned, as one reads in 
Hosea, but only Judah. Therefore, the fact that he 
includes Israel, which has never returned, clearly 
indicates that he is speaking of a spiritual kingdom, in 
which the scattered Israelites were gathered and are 
still gathered today, wherever they are. 


V. 15 For the LORD has taken away your 
punishment (judicium). 

This is a way of speaking that has, as it were, 
lopposite meanings. Job, cap. 27, 2 [Vulg.]: "As God 
lives, who has taken away my judgment," is the same 
as: to deny justice, not to allow a judgment. Here the 
lopposite is: He hides, namely, condemnation upon 
ou. Thus Paul says 1 Cor. 11, 31: "So we judged 
ourselves." This is what corripere means in Latin.

But out of fatherly care, Hebr. 12, 6. In the Psalm it says 
[Ps. 105, 14.]: The enemy can no longer harm them. 
Through evil the wicked promote the godly. 


The LORD, the King of Israel, is with you. 


This is obviously spoken of Christ. Here he describes 
Christ exceedingly beautifully. Here is Adonai, which 
alone is attributed to GOtte. Thou hast furthermore no 
longer mere men for kings, but "the Lord" 2c. - "With 
thee." The apostles express this thus: He is seated at the 
right hand of the Father, he was among us. We are in 
him, and he in us. John 6:56, "He abideth in me." "We 
will come to him," Jn. 14:23. Though kings are over 
bodies and over goods, this one is over the heart and 
conscience; he dwells with you. 


That you must no longer be afraid of any 
misfortune. 


He says emphatically, "fear no more," for it is different 
to suffer a calamity than to fear it. The righteous die, but 
they do not taste death; the righteous are subject to all 
evils, but do not feel them. The law remains, but its sting 
and poison are taken away from it; death is deprived of 
its sting. Thus all evils are not evils because they are not 
felt. Therefore, Christ's kingdom is such that his saints 
are in the midst of evils, but under the fear of calamity. 
In the Psalm it says [Ps. 64, 2. Vulg.:) "Save my soul 
from the fear of the enemy." As if to say, Easily would | 
despise the enemy if there were no fear. The wicked do 
not know this, who, when they are oppressed by evils, 
become sad and depressed by the evils, because they 
do not have the Spirit. 


At that time they will say to Jerusalem, "Do not be 
afraid. 

The prophet stops with congratulations. He wants to 
say the same thing that is pronounced in the Psalm [Ps. 
118, 15.]: "One sings with joy of victory in the tabernacles 
of the righteous." This is the preaching and boasting 
among Christians. Fear not, Jerusalem, desist not, 
daughter of Zion, are he 





admonishing words, as if he wanted to say: Because you 
have your King 1) with you, whom would you fear? [Rom. 
8, 31: "Is God for us" 2c. These are words against fear 
and sloth, as if he wanted to say: | admit that many 
misfortunes occur, but do not be afraid, do not be 
discouraged. Here he clearly indicates that there will be 
across, but that against it there is the Spirit and strength 
enough that the saints will be strengthened and their 
hands will not be left alone. Satan does not let up. If he 
cannot overcome by cunning, he finally overcomes by 
perseverance, by fatigue, by the long duration of the 
challenge. 


[And to Zion: Do not let your hands become loose!) 
"Stop, stand firm!" But this is our sermon.

Savior. 


All these words imply that one must recognize that the 
cross is there, for there would be no need for such 
glorious words of comfort if there were no fear. |, he says,

Thus: Nugas, qui a lege [recesserant], Jerome has 
translated, and for this he has his cause. He wants to 
prove from this passage that the Hebrew language is the 
mother of all languages. The fact that such great men are 
so grossly lacking is so that we may know that we are 
also human. Nugae is not a Hebrew word, except in the 
status constructus [XXX], otherwise it is XXXX (nugim). 
But nobody says that it is Latin. Therefore it is a gross 
error in grammar even for those who are only mediocre 
Hebrews, tzui a lege, XXXX, is a common word: 
something fixed, a definite time. Gen. 1, 14: He created 
the sun and the other lights of heaven] to serve for years,

The opinion is: The kingdom of Christ will be such that it 
takes away those who are sorrowful, who are temporally 
oppressed by sorrow. If someone has fallen into sin, Gal. 
6, 1. those who are weak in faith and life | will take away, 
because the kingdom of Christ is such that it carries both. 
The weak must be spared, lest they be vexed, though 
they fall into the most grievous 8) sins. One must see that 
they are received, that they are punished but not cast 
away. - "Those who are under you." | will look upon the 
weak in faith and life, because they are among you, and 
put them away. The motherly mercy in Christ is indicated, 
with which he cherishes and cares for us sinners, as a 
mother does her nasty child. He wants to bear the fruit of 
his body 9), Is. 46, 3. 4. So Isaiah further says [Cap. 49, 
15.ft Like a mother caresses her child (cui). "| admonish

who, through the mercy of God"], 1) Rom. 12, 1. For 
Christ is not only patient, but also has the attitude of a 
mother toward us, if we only recognize it. Thus he is 
stern-minded against enemies for those who obey. If he 
is only merciful, then no sin can harm us, not even the 
weaknesses in faith and life. This is an exceedingly 
beautiful promise for despondent and _ frightened 
consciences. Whoever recognizes Christ in this way, let 
him boast that he has attained something: To consider 
Christ as a mother, that is the right knowledge of Christ. 
"He says to those who abide in the pure word, "You who 
are carried by me in the body. But such people are rare, 
because the devil uses it to cast it out and take it away. 
When we die, we run to our mother, the mother hen; that 
is the bosom of Christ. "I will take away," | will take away,

they are not in you.

shame. 


| will take care, and this shall not be the smallest part of 
my Office, that | carry the weak. Our doctrine is the most 
perfect and purest of all, because it commands the 
highest faith in God 2c. Then comes our exceedingly 
beautiful reason and compares the impure life with the 
faith we teach: they teach indeed, but where are those 
who accept it? they remain teachers like others. They 
say our life is exceedingly impure, the doctrine all pure. 
[They may be mindful of] 2) what man is. He is a rational 
being. He is given the power to govern everything, Gen. 
1, 28. Look at the children in the cradle, they can do 
nothing less [than that. They have nothing] than what is 
brought to them by men. There lies the being who is to 
rule over others, and can do nothing but weep. Thus 
says Pliny. Where are the works praised by men in the 
children? It is to be hoped; it is not a mere name, but it 
will come to that. So it goes with the creatures. A shrub,

If this delay is credited to other creatures, why not also 
to humans? Hopeful reason compares our weakness 
with the strong doctrine and demands perfection. It is 
enough that man remains in the body, in the mother and 
in the womb of God. In the letter to the Thessalonians [1 
Ep. 2, 7] Paul boasts that he had a motherly attitude. -

through the cross, and we have suffered that we are 
made ashamed, the time will come that our 
righteousness will be brought forth, Ps. 37, 6. "Whoever 
honors me" or glorifies me, is said in 1 Sam. 2, 30. The 
world considered the martyrs to be sweepings, so they 
bore the reproach of Christ for the praise of Christ. God 
has glorified them in such a way that they are praised, 
glorified and held in honor.

(). Interpretation of the Prophet Haggai. 


1, interpretation about the prophet Haggai, 


according to the Altenburg manuscript. *) 


From Luther's lectures, which began on September 11, 1525, and were probably completed in the same month. Printed in 1886. 


Translated from Latin. 


Preface to Haggai. 


Haggai is the lightest of all the prophets, and if we 
look at the matter without the right attitude, the prophet 
will appear to be very little, especially in our times, when 
all the things of which he prophesies, namely the 
rebuilding of the Temple, have ceased. Therefore, we 
must look at the matter in the right way, so that we do 
not ignore both the object and the word of God. 


take into account. It will be very important for us to keep 
this in mind, not only in this prophet, but in many other 
scriptures where we read similar things. The matter is 
the material temple, and yet the divine majesty 
condescends to speak so much about the rebuilding of 
the temple, as if it were of great importance. Therefore, 
we should also remember here 


*Already in 1552, when the fourth volume of the Latin Wittenberg edition appeared, the editors lacked a transcript of Luther's lectures 
on the prophet Haggai. Because they wished to have an explanation of each of the minor prophets, they persuaded Melanchthon to prepare 
one. He wrote a VrAumsntum conciormm kropUstas IluMki, which is found in the Latin Wittenberg (1552), tom. IV, col. 666 8H. This writing 
was published in 1555 by LI. Stephan Agricola, "der stad Mersburg Pfarrherrn," into German, and is included in the Wittenberg edition (1556), 
vol. VIII, p. 559. At the end there is the note: "Such interpretation is in 1552. by Dsominumj Philippum Melanthonem ge- 


1710 L. xxvil, 393 f. Interpretations on the prophets. 


and learn not to value and look at the things in the 
Scriptures as well as the heart and the words, so that 
we may value the works of God according to the will 
of God, which are all very good, no matter how small 
and despised they may seem to be. Hypocrisy, 
however, acts quite differently, for it despises the 
word of God and looks, as it were, with its mouth 
agape at the works that are commanded, whether it 
be a small or a great work, in quite the opposite way, 
for one should judge a work, not according to its 
greatness or smallness, but according to the will of 
Him who commands such a work. This is done by 
faith, which knows that the great and the small work 
of the same is God's work, and judges it according to 
the word of God, which it considers great, looking 
only at the will of God. For the word by which the 
Jews were commanded to rebuild the Temple and the 
word by which God created all creatures in heaven 
and on earth in the beginning are one and the same 
word. We must do the same here, and then this 
prophecy will be of great use to us 2c. 

The time, however, at which the prophet Haggai 
prophesied, is clear from the title, because he says 
that he prophesied under the king Darius. 
Incidentally, the histories of both the Greeks and the 
Latins differ greatly from each other, so that nothing 
certain can be determined. For among the historians 
there are many arguments about the number of kings 
of the Persians. | have, as lightly as | have 
understood it 





1711 


The order and the years were brought together in a 
table, of which | believe that it is already known to all, 
because it has appeared in print. 1) From it, whoever 
wants to, can investigate the order in which one king 
followed the other 2c. But this difficulty is caused by 
nothing else than by the fact that one and the same 
king had two, often also three names. For Cambyses 
or Artaxerxes is called Nebucadnezzar in the book of 
Judith, but he was the son of the very powerful king 
Cyrus, who was succeeded in the reign of Darm by 
the fourth [king], Longimanus 2c. Now under Cyrus 
the Jews returned from captivity, and set about 
rebuilding the temple, but they were hindered by the 
neighboring pagans, and could not carry out their 
undertaking, for they could hardly with great effort 
keep off the hostile pagans. Then Xerxes 2) forbade 
by a manifest command that the temple be rebuilt, 
and so nothing else was accomplished by Cyrus than 
that the Jews were brought back from captivity. The 
temple could not be rebuilt, however much Cyrus had 
commanded the rebuilding, for they did not yet have 
the word of God; the counsel and commandment 
was only of men. | say this so that no one may think 
that there is a contradiction here. 


1) See the first note on this prophet. 

2) This is Cambyses. The Zwickau manuscript says: "Cambyses. 
The Greeks call him Lerxes, the Scriptures Artaxerxes." The 
Altenburg manuscript has here in the margin: or Cambyses. 


The text was printed because no interpretation of Luther on this prophet was available. None of the other editions has included it, because it 
is not by Luther. Since the matter now stands like this, it can be called a pleasing event that in recent times the Altenburg, Zwickau and Hall 
manuscripts, which we have already discussed many times, have been found and published. We believe (with the Weimar edition) that the 
chronological table mentioned in the preface to this prophet in the aforementioned three manuscripts is not the chronological work published 
by Luther only in 1541 with the Kupxutatio rauiicii, which he, as he says at the beginning of the preface, made only for his own use, but a 
small table (sIMotirtia), which covers only the Median-Persian kingdoms, which he had printed for the use of students. Therefore, the concern 
that v. Kolde (deutsche Litteraturzeitung 1888, No. 14) raised regarding Luther's authorship on the basis of this table is not valid. He has 
withdrawn the same in his "Martin Luther", vol. Il, p. 529. Our writing has in the Altenburg manuscript the title: Ooiumolltarius In XMouua 
kroxtetam ?er M. I*utdoruru. ‘iVittemberMe HXXXV. XI. LoptoMdris. The time when the lecture on this prophet is finished is nowhere 
indicated. At the end of the Zwickau manuscript there is a note that the lectures were interrupted for a time, but this will not have lasted long, 
for in the same year Luther began Zechariah. For the first time our writing is printed in the Erlanger, sx6A. oxx., toua. XXVII, p. 393, thereafter, 
"considerably improved," in the Weimar, vol. XIII, p. 532. According to the latter edition we have translated. 


1712 L. xxvil, 395 s. Interpretation of Haggai (1.), preface. 





Of the spirit and mind of the prophet. 


The word of God is of such a kind that it is always 
proclaimed and comes when all things are in despair, 
when people think that nothing less will happen than 
what the word of God says will certainly happen. For 
it does not come to those who are in good peace or 
live in pleasure, for to them it is a laughing matter, 
but to the weak, oppressed and poor, full of whom it 
is also only 1) received, namely, so that all human 
boasting may perish, nothing be attributed to our 
powers or efforts, but everything alone to God, since 
the divine goodness allows such things, which are 
quite impossible according to the judgment of 
reason, to be accomplished by men from the lowly 
yeast. This we see here quite obviously. For here the 
rebuilding of the temple is commanded against the 
mightiest and bitterest enemies, it is commanded, | 
say, to a weak and few in number people, who are 
resisted by the mightiest princes, the mightiest 
nations, who dwelled all around and threatened them 
daily with destruction and devotion, as can be seen 
from the book of Ezra. For the violence of the 
neighboring nations was so great that the Jews were 
forced to clench with one hand, fight with the other, 
and hold off the hostile nations. And yet this one and 
very lowly prophet dares to stand up against these 
exceedingly bitter and powerful enemies and 
prophesy of the rebuilding of the temple, and so he 
commands the few people who had just been torn 
out of the exceedingly difficult captivity to oppose the 
furious and very puffed up king, who did not want that 


1) Instead of barMern, we have assumed baMulIL. 





1713 


the temple was to be rebuilt, whose army was so 
great that he could not count his innumerable men of 
war, but had to measure them by tens of thousands. 
Namely, we must consider this power of courage and 
spirit, although it shows itself in a very small general 
opportunity. For here the hearts are awakened 
against the mightiest king and the very strong 
Gentiles, who would rather that all the Jews were 
destroyed than that the temple be rebuilt. And yet it is 
the word of the Lord that commands this, which must 
be obeyed, even if the whole world opposes it, as the 
Jews also obeyed. For if we so honor God that he is 
true, it happens that everything that was at first hostile 
to us must promote and help our endeavor, as has 
also happened here, where all exceedingly heavy 
burdens and the most hostile obstacles have been 
transformed into the most peaceful help. For, as 
history says, the princes were commanded by the 
king to assist the people, who had previously been 
ordered to resist and hinder. Thus, through God's 
counsel, that which before seemed quite impossible 
was easily accomplished. Namely, divine grace turns 
everything for the best for the believers through 
miraculous counsel: judgment becomes salvation for 
them, sin becomes righteousness 2c. The enemies 
become their friends and subordinates, because God 
has everything in his hand, who is the ruler over 
everything. The whole world must obey him, kings 
and all princes, for he does not let any man harm his 
anointed, but punishes kings for their sake, as the 
exceedingly fine 105th Psalm, v. 14, says. Therefore, 
if God is for us, who can be against us? Rom. 8, 31. 
This is the main point and the goal (scopus) of things 
and of the mind or spirit, which we have to look at in 
this prophecy, and so everything becomes lovely. 


1714 L. XXVII, 396-398. interpretations on the prophets. 1715 


[The first chapter. ] 


V. 1. In the other year of King Darius, in the sixth 
month. 


This prophet was simultaneous with Zechariah, 
for both prophesied under King Darius (namely, the 
fourth, who first succeeded King Cambyses in the 
reign), except that Haggai began two months before 
Zechariah, which is indicated by the titles of both 
prophets, for the one began to prophesy in the sixth 
month, the other in the eighth, as the Histories also 
indicate. 


On the first day (in the una). 


The Hebrews used the same expression for one 
day and the first day, as it also appears from Gen. 1, 
5: "Then the evening and the morning became the 
first day" (this unus). But here it should have been 
translated: On the first day (in the prima). - 1) In 
manu, that is, through Haggai. 


V. 2. This people says: The time has not yet come. 


He begins with rebuke, that is the way of all 
prophets. For first of all they rebuke, they threaten 
God's wrath, then they add sweet and lovely 
promises. This is not done by the devil, who first lures 
souls with enticements; when he has thus led them 
into error, he overthrows and corrupts them. Satau's 
preachers do the same by their teaching. God, 
however, first leads into hell, but then out again; he 
humbles and restores; he disgraces through shame 
and finally makes glorious. 

Therefore, the rebuke of the people begins here 
because of their negligence, since they had 
neglected to build the temple of the Lord because 
they had been deterred. And this is the opinion of the 
people, as if they wanted to say: We have indeed 
started to build the temple under Cyrus, but the 
neighboring 


1) Already here the Weimar edition has the verse number "3." The 
verse number "2." is missing. 





The fact that the Gentiles prevented us from 
continuing the work we had begun leads us to believe 
that it is not the will of the Lord that the temple be 
rebuilt by us. This opinion is countered by the 
prophet, or the Lord through the prophet; he wants 
the work that has been started to be carried out 
diligently, he wants it to be carried out through all 
enemies, through all violence. He wants us to look to 
His will, so that we do not succumb, weary and 
overcome by adversity, so that we may persevere 
and be saved. That is why we must break through, 
no matter how much the world rages against it. 

Therefore, no one in the preaching ministry of God 
has an excuse for being attacked, for the world, the 
devil, or the princes of the world, or whatever 
enemies they may be, to set themselves against him, 
because if he is a servant of God and believes, he 
knows very well that his Lord is mightier and higher 
than all authority and power, he knows that all the 
wisdom, power, glory, and strength of the world 
before God is nothing but dust of the earth, which a 
violent and impetuous storm throws here and there. 
So he also knows that God has promised that when 
his servants are brought to trial and have to stand 
before kings and princes, he will give them a mouth 
and wisdom that no one will ever know. He will give 
them a mouth and wisdom that no one can resist, just 
as He promised Jeremiah [Cap. 1, 18]: "I will make 
you a strong city and a pillar of iron" 2c. 


V. 4. But your time is here 2c. 


The prophet carefully describes the unbelief of the 
people, namely that they had the power and the 
greatness of the king of the Persians before their 
eyes, likewise the anger and the power of the 
neighboring heathens. But the divine power was not 
so before their eyes, therefore they could not but fear 
and succumb. This is how we must die, this is how 
we must be overcome, if, since we are to die, we are 
to wait for death and for 


1716 L. XXVII, 398-400. interpretation of Haggai (1.), Cap. 1, 4-7. 


1717 





We must not look at sin, which must inevitably make 
our conscience guilty and disgraceful, and condemn 
the dismayed conscience. On the contrary, we must 
act in such a way that we turn our eyes away from 
sin, from death, from the devil, from the adversaries, 
in short, from all evils that are difficult for us, and be 
as joyful and cheerful full of confidence as if this were 
nothing at all, as if it were none of our business, as 
the prophet says in the Psalm [Ps. 3:7]: "| am not 
afraid of many hundreds of those who are baptized, 
who lie about against me." The prophet acts in the 
same way here, when he wants to bring the people 
from unbelief to faith, as if he wanted to say: "If it is 
not time to rebuild the house of the Lord, how is it time 
to build your houses? In you, therefore, is all unbelief 
and avarice, since you are all eager to build your 
houses and leave the work of the Lord pending. You 
are only concerned about your own benefit, but not 
about what is the Lord's in the same way. By the way, 
that he says: 


In panelled houses ‘ 


So | don't know if it is said in praise or 
disparagement of the houses. | understand it simply 
from the covered houses, because | do not think that 
they had vaulted or with arches deliciously built 
houses, so that the simple sense is: You neglect my 
house and leave it desolate, but for your houses you 
take care, your houses you build 2c. 


V. 5. 6. See how you are doing 2c. 


[Ponite corda vestra super vias vestras] is a Hebrew 
saying. It means: consider your ways and your 
undertakings or your works, consider the prosperity 
of your affairs. "Consider how you fare," as if to say, 
"From punishment you may well realize that you have 
sinned, since everything goes out to you so 
unhappily, since the flourishing of all things is so 
undesirable, since the earth does not return with 
usury the seed it has received, since the vineyards 
have borne grapes meagerly 2c. Ye have eaten, and 
have not been satisfied, and have had little to feed 
yourselves upon, and have gathered money no other 
way than into a crushed and pierced bag. For 


By the word "bag" he means the container in which 
we keep our money. Therefore, it is a proverbial 
image: You have put your money in a bag full of 
holes, that is, everything disappears from under your 
hands, you have no success in your affairs 2c. But 
behold God's wonderful counsel. He had brought this 
people out of the servitude of Egypt with great 
miracles and with a strong hand, he had fed them 
lazily in the wilderness for forty years, he had slain 
many pagans and the kings who were hostile to this 
people, until he led them into the land promised to the 
fathers. But what does he do? Since the people had 
already been led into the land that had such 
exceedingly rich promises made to them and to the 
fathers, he lets them be attacked and miserably 
afflicted by the neighboring nations. The land does 
not return to them the entrusted seed with usury, they 
sow in vain, they reap in vain, they hunger and thirst. 
Is this what it means to stand by the promises? Here 
nothing less was in view than that God would be true 
and keep what he had promised. Yes, just the 
opposite happened, since the people were in such 
great need, in such great misery: Lack, in such great 
misery was oppressed. But this is how God, in His 
goodness, acts according to His ways, to make us 
fools and to make our attempts fail, so that we may 
learn that we can do nothing with our counsel or our 
efforts, that everything is nothing and nothing 
succeeds, but that the Lord alone does everything, so 
that we may restore everything to Him. Then, after we 
have endured the storm, it will be turned into lovely, 
cheerful weather. Lest the Jews should afterwards 
boast and ascribe anything to their strength, they 
were forced to confess of necessity, but were taught 
by experience that when all was in despair, they were 
encouraged by the Lord, that the Lord had given them 
both a courageous heart and good fortune in their 
affairs, so that they rebuilt the temple 2c. 


V. 7: See how you are doing. 


This is a repetition of the previous. As if to say, 
time is not to blame, but what you have earned is

It was your fault that you could not continue and carry 
out the work you had started. For the time was already 
there when you could have continued 2c. 


V. 8: Go to the mountains and cut wood. 1) 

This is the second part of the prophetic sermon. 
For after the threats and the scolding he adds here 
promises, so that it does not seem as if he had 
forgotten the prophetic office. Here now a clear and 
obvious word of God is added to the work of man. This 
word clearly commands the rebuilding of the Temple, 
since no work, no matter how brilliant and good it may 
seem, is valid before God, unless the word of God 
approves it, or unless it is confirmed by the word of 
God that it is based on the word of God. For even 
consciences can never be certain without the Word, 
which sets forth God's will against us. Then, when the 
conscience is so fortified and assured by the Word 
that such a work is approved by God, that he has 
undertaken it at God's command, then he submits 
himself to every thing, he breaks through by always 
looking to the will of God; then it happens that 
everything becomes pleasing to God, however much 
the weakness of our flesh may hinder it, which we see 
in the apostle Paul. - "Up the mountain." | take "the 
mountain" for the place where the temple had been 
built before, where it was now to be built again. Here 
we must be mindful of what we said above 
immediately in the beginning, that the matter must be 
assessed according to the words of God, and then it 
will be seen that it is an exceedingly high work, which 
is commanded and confirmed by the word of God 2c. 


| want that to be pleasant. 

This is another and certainly a great promise, that 
their hearts will be so fixed by God through the Word 
of God that they will not be able to doubt that it 
pleases God to do what is presented. 


1) Vulgate: in montsm, portats NMA 
- Go up the mountain, bring wood. This is what the interpretation refers 
to. 





work taken. The evangelists also used this way of 
speaking, as [Matth. 3, 17.]: "This is my beloved Son, 
in whom | am well pleased" 2c. The mountain in itself 
was nothing at all, for it was earth, as is the 
foundation of the whole world, but because GOD 
chooses this place by His word, because He declares 
that this place pleases Him, that He wants to show 
His glory in this place, it certainly has an advantage 
over all the other mountains, and that by the power of 
GOD's word. And certainly this place alone was a 
great cause for the Jews to rage against the 
Christians and against the prophets who spoke 
against the temple, as is also evident from the Acts 
of the Apostles in the history of Stephen [Apost. 6, 13. 
7, 48. ff.]. The kingdom of Christ was promised to the 
Jews, to which everything that preceded, both words 
and works, had to be related, as everything was 
intended to be. Therefore all works had to be directed 
to Christ; because the hypocrites did not do this, they 
deceived themselves and others. This was certainly 
an extremely sweet promise for the Jews, since they 
were made certain of God's good pleasure through 
the word of God with regard to an outward sign, 
namely the bodily temple, just as our sacraments are 
also extremely pleasing to the eye, since Christ 
wanted them to be signs of the grace promised and 
shown through Him 2c. 


And will show my honor. 


The first temple was very splendid, it stood tall, it 
was very exquisitely built; with great riches, with a 
great amount of gold, silver and precious stones it 
was abundantly provided, as can be seen from the 
first book of Kings. But the glory of this last temple 
was not less, though it was not so exquisitely rebuilt, 
for the construction could not be compared with the 
first. But the worship in the last temple was much 
more famous, since at that time all the nations, which 
before the captivity were extremely hostile to the 
Jews, finally went up at the same time as the Jews to 
this last temple to worship God, as | also mentioned 
above in the third chapter of Zephaniah [v. 10]. 


1720 L. XXVII, 402-404. interpretation of Haggai (1.), Cap. 1, 8-13. 


1721 





which did not happen in the first temple, to which 
alone the Jews came to worship God. 


V. 9. 1) So | destroy it. 


The prophet throws his sermon whimsically 
through each other. For here he returns to the 
previous scolding, when he had said: "Look how you 
are doing" 2c. But the Hebrew word [XXX] means to 
blow, as is also clear from the first book of Moses 
[Cap. 2, 7/, "to breathe into a thing", to let out the 
breath. By this word it is indicated that God very 
easily turns the present abundance into nothing, that 
when He curses, nothing succeeds, that even the 
greatest abundance fades away; and again He can 
send the greatest blessing into the greatest poverty, 
as it is His way that He makes everything out of 
nothing, out of the greatest poverty the greatest 
prosperity and an exceedingly happy progress and 
success in all things, as many Psalms and the Gospel 
histories are full of. 


Every man hastens to his house. 
That is, you are too intent on your own affairs. 


V. 11. And I have called the drought, both over land 
and mountains, over grain (super triticum). 


Our copies read badly: vocavit super triticum; 
more correctly it should read: about grain 2c. Above 
we have said everything. 


V. 12. 2) And the people feared the Lord. 


Here the prophet adds what fruit the preached 
word has brought, since the word of God is such that 
when it is preached, it never returns empty. It cannot 
but produce fruit in some to whom it is sent, as it says 
in Isaiah Cap. 55, 11. So here, after hearing the word 
of God, they received the word in faith and believed 
the word, and they were awakened and made ready 
to do the work that was to be done.

God had commanded, which would not have 
happened if God's goodness had not sent ahead the 
most lovely and comforting promises, by which, 
strengthened, they did not doubt that they would be 
pleasing to God by rebuilding the Temple. 


V. 13. 3) Then spoke Haggai, the angel of the Lord, 
who had the message of the Lord (de uunciis Domini). 

| would rather read [instead of de nunciis Domini]: 
inter angelos Domini, so that the Greek word [ayyeéAo¢ 
--- angel would remain, as it is also in Malachi Cap. 
3, 1. "Behold, | will send my angel" 2c. Likewise 
elsewhere [Mal. 2, 7.], "For he is an angel of the 
LORD of hosts." This word was also taken up by the 
evangelist Matthew [Matth. 11, 10.]: "Behold, | send 
my angel before thee" 2c. "Messenger" does not have 
such a glorious meaning, and it is not necessary to 
distinguish the Spirit (whom we call angel) from man 
by the word angel. For all who bring the word of GOD, 
who are the proclaimers or ministers of the word, are 
called angels of GOD, as those of Satan are angels, 
who devote their services to Satan, who bring Satan's 
doctrine, as the apostle Paul also called them. It is 
truly a great honor for a miserable poor man to be 
called a messenger of God and to have the same 
name in common with the heavenly spirits, as Paul 
also calls himself a messenger of God here and there, 
and here Haggai calls himself an angel of the Lord for 
the sake of the prestige of the Word 2c. 


| am with you, says the Lord. 


| think that here is a new sermon, because Haggai 
did not complete this whole prophecy in one sermon. 
And the prophets sometimes have a way of reciting 
the richest and most glorious promises only in 
extremely short words, as also here the unspeakable 
mercy of God is promised in words that seem to be 
so brief and short. If God is for us, who can oppose 
us?

Much 1) less will any enemy be able to harm us as 
he cannot harm GOtte. Here all creatures must give 
way. If we have God as our protector (for that is what 
he calls God being with us), no evil, no pestilence, no 
persecution, no physical or spiritual challenge can be 
so great that he will let us succumb. For how should 
creatures be able to overcome their Creator? See the 
eighth’ chapter of the Epistle to the Romans [v. 38. 
f.]. And this the prophet no doubt set forth in very 
many words when he preached. 


v. 14. And the Lord raised the spirit of Zerubbabel. 


He also adds the fruit of this sermon. By the way, 
it was not enough to have heard the word, if the Lord 
had not also given power to the word, so that it would 
be effective in their hearts. For God must be present 
with His effect when we hear the word, as Christ also 
says [John 6:44]: "No one can come to Me except the 
Father" 2c. For it must be the Spirit

as a companion of the Word, which kindles the heart, 
as it is said here that the spirit of Zerubbabel and the 
others is awakened. This passage argues against 
the nonsensical prophets of our times, who despise, 
even completely reject the preaching of the Word, 
although it is brighter than the light here, that the Holy 
Spirit writes into the hearts exactly what Haggai had 
preached 2c. 


The spirit. 

That is, the heart, "a courage". The Germans use 
this word in various ways: "He has courage," that is, 
he is hopeful, likewise courageous, gifted with a 
certain strength of spirit to bravely endure adversity. 
Thus, the Spirit is awakened in us by God when God 
blows on us with His Spirit, when He instills in us 
courage or confidence through the Spirit to pursue 
some undertaking that we would otherwise hardly 
have dared to approach because we were fearful. 
Namely, the Holy Spirit is like this because we are 
fearful in the things of God. The flesh cannot entrust 
itself to God, it cannot but fear the world and the 
adversaries. Therefore, we need the Spirit as a 
strengthener and encourager. When the Spirit 
comes, he encourages us so that we will not 
withdraw from anything for the glory of God, but dare 
to do anything, even to approach God. 


The second chapter. 


V. 1. On the fourth and twentieth day of the sixth 
month. 


There seems to be a difference here in what has 
been said, 3) namely in the distance of the days from 
each other. For in the first chapter the prophet says 
that he began the prophecy on the first day of the 
month. But with the Hebrews it is March. 


3) Instead of IL ooto, which we could not make sense of, we have

the first month. So it was this month [our] August, and 
the prophet preached for three weeks, and in the 
meantime he also took some other people to help 
him in preaching. At this point I like Lyra, who wants 
this part of the second chapter to belong to the first 
chapter and to be added to the end of it, so that we 
now begin the second chapter after the words "of 
King Darius". So Haggai preached three weeks and 
three days before Zechariah began his prophecy. 


1724 L. XXVII, 406-408. interpretation of Haggai (1.), Cap. 2, 2-7. 


V. 2. On the one and twentieth day of the seventh 
month. 


Here a new chapter and a new sermon begins, and in 
Hebrew these verses are differentiated, but the Hebrew 
differentiations do not agree in all parts with the Latin 
chapters. At this point the prophet begins the third 
sermon, in which he comforts the people by describing 
the future kingdom of Christ, even that it was already 
imminent, that it would soon come to pass. For this 
prophet describes the kingdom of Christ in such a way 
that it seems to be already at the door (as one is wont to 
say); he proclaims it so near that there is almost no other 
among the prophets who has done the same, and he 
puts all his effort into the description of the kingdom of 
Christ, so that the people may believe the truth of the 
promises with certainty. But he starts his consolation in 
the way of a concession: 


V. 4. 1) Who is left among you 2c. 


He admits to them that the words of God seem 
impossible, because the captivity lasted seventy years 
and many had been taken away into captivity as little 
children, like Daniel, who lived almost until the return 
from captivity. So also here the text indicates that there 
were still some left who had seen the former house built 
so gloriously and deliciously. Therefore, it seemed 
impossible to them that the temple could be restored, just 
as the preaching of the Gospel seemed foolish to us in 
the beginning. But God shows His power in this way, 
because when we expect nothing less, when we think 
that everything is going to ruin, then the Lord stands by, 
as we Said in the preface at the beginning. For reason 
cannot turn its attention to the word of God, it has its eyes 
fixed only on the present things, as it is excellently 
presented to us here. But God, whose way it is to make 
everything out of nothing, for this reason gives a word 
that is completely opposed to the present work, so that 
we may learn to be more attentive to his word than to the

1725 


present things. Because the priests and the people were 
looking at the rebuilding of the temple, it seemed to be a 
quite impossible thing, therefore the hearts wavered, 
frightened by the greatness and difficulty of the matter. 
Therefore, the Lord strengthens the people with the 
sweetest promises: 


V. 5. 6. All people, be of good cheer, for | am with 
you, says the LORD of hosts. 2) Do not be afraid 2c. 


These are quite fiery words to encourage the heart of 
the people. For he repeats the same words from the 
previous sermon (Cap. 1, 13] to indicate how glorious 
and exceedingly comforting a sermon it is when the Lord 
promises that he will be with us 2c., as if to say: If you 
fear Satan, death, sin, the hostile nations, then |, God, 
who am far more powerful than all of them, am with you, 
and will keep the promised covenant that | made with you 
in Egypt. Nowadays we do not have such promises 3) as 
the Jews once had, whose whole nation was called 
GOD's people. Now, however, is a spiritual kingdom, and 
such promises only concern the godly, whether they be 
of the Jews or of the Gentiles. But God has preserved 
the Jews, both the godly and the godless, for the sake of 
the future kingdom of Christ. And even though today He 
sometimes spares a country for the sake of a few 
righteous people, we do not have a promise from God as 
the Jews once had. 


My Spirit shall remain among you. 


My spirit will be in your midst, that is, it will be firm in 
you, that is, you will have a bold and confident heart. 


V. 7. There is yet a little, that | may move heaven and 
earth, and the sea and dry land.

You see why he carries the ungodly, why he would 
have the covenant. He does not look at merits or debts, 
but only at the future kingdom of Christ. For his sake, 
namely because of the King Christ, he carries all of them, 
since Christ should be born from them. This passage 
clearly convicts all the Jews, so that they cannot 
contradict it, because it clearly shows that the first nation 
(that is, the Jews) will remain a carnal nation until the 
future of Christ. And it could not perish before the birth 
of Christ, for whose sake the outward people was 
preserved, which God, separated and chosen from all 
the peoples of the earth, called His people. But now the 
Jews are no longer such a people, because they have 
neither a kingdom nor a priesthood. Therefore, if this text 
is true, as it certainly must be, the Jews cannot deny that 
Christ, who was promised to the fathers, has come, since 
today they have neither a duke, nor priests, nor prophets, 
of which they never lacked before Christ's birth, even in 
captivity. For they had in captivity Daniel and Jeremiah 
as preachers of the word, who upheld and encouraged 
them by the word of God, so that they would not have 
doubts 2c. 


And dry. 


The church teachers have here various 
interpretations of the birth of the Lord, of which the 
prophets do not say much; but it must be understood 
from the ministry of John, as also Christ says (Matth. 11, 
13.]: "All the prophets and the law prophesied until John." 
The kingdom of Christ began with the baptism and 
preaching of Christ, not with his birth, that is, when Christ 
was baptized, and the voice of the Father was heard 
from heaven (Matth. 3, 17.]: "This is my dear Son" 2c., 
and thus he was appointed teacher, master, duke and 
king. Thus, almost all passages in the prophets have 
their foresight on Christ's kingdom, few on the birth, like 
the one in Isaiah (Cap. 7, 14.]: "Behold, a virgin is with 
child and will bear a son" 2c. Therefore, through the 
kingdom of Christ everything is now changed: the law 





and the prophets lasted until John, we have been 
changed by the gospel; now the earth is changed for us, 
because we are no longer attached to the elements of 
this world; the pope is nothing, because the hearts are 
changed and they dislike the pope's kingdom; therefore 
it cannot change. So God moves everything today, 
because he has changed the hearts that do not care 
about the raging of the world and the princes 2c. 


v. 8. Then shall come the consolation of all the 
Gentiles. 


[Instead of desideratus in the Vulgate] lies 
desiderium (the desire or desiderabile (the desiring) of 
all pagans. It can be understood in a suffering or in an 
active way. But | take it for the figure which looks well to 
all the Gentiles, that is, for the treasure which was to be 
spread by the gospel. And so he calls it an exceedingly 
lovely treasure, which the Gentiles did not know; so 
much is lacking in it that they could have desired it. Thus 
he indicates that the kingdom is to be spread through the 
whole world among all nations, as also Christ Luc. 24, 
47. says: "And cause repentance and remission of sins 
to be preached in his name among all nations" 2c. Above 
we have spoken very abundantly about this matter in the 
other prophets. Dear, what will the Jews be able to 
murmur against this passage? They may tell us what this 
desirable thing is, which, as is said here, has been 
spread among the Gentiles in such a short time. Surely 
we have received nothing from them but the preaching 
of the gospel, which is the noblest treasure and the most 
desirable good. 


And | will make this house full of glory”. 


He explains this sentence more broadly, so that they 
may know that in the new temple they will worship the 
Lord with the Gentiles. The glory of this later temple was 
that Christ adorned it with His presence and with His 
preaching, although it was also a great glory that the 
Gentiles who had been converted to the faith also came 
to this later temple. 


1728 


V. 9. For mine is both silver and gold. 


In Hebrew, the meaning is ambiguous, and it can 
be interpreted in two ways. The first interpretation is 
this, as if he wanted to say: You think that there is no 
amount of gold and silver as in the first temple, 
therefore it is impossible that this later temple will be 
so glorious. But | have abundance of all things, | am 
rich enough, mine is all that is on earth, therefore do 
not be troubled about the gold 2c. The other view is: 
neither gold nor silver is required for this glory. "My 
hand has made all that is," says Isaiah Cap. 66, 2. 
And Ps. 50, 10. 12. f.: "All the beasts of the forest are 
mine. Where | hungered, | would not tell thee of it. | 
will not eat ox meat" 2c. Thus it is transferred from 
the carnal glory to the spiritual glory, therefore | like 
this view. As if to say, this glory will not be in gold, 
silver, or any outward things, but in my Christ who will 
bring peace, as follows. By this he indicates that the 
gospel shall be preached in Jerusalem, as also Isaias 
says [Cap. 2, 3.], "From Zion shall go forth the law, 1) 
and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem, and Luc. 
24, 47. "And lift up at Jerusalem." Here they may 
answer us again, when this shall finally come to pass, 
when the gospel shall be spread out of Jerusalem? 
2c. Here, therefore, is also an exceedingly clear 
passage against the Jews, and well worthy of 
attention, both for the sake of the Jews, to shut them 
up, since they deny that Christ is born, and for our 
sake, that our consciences may be fortified, for there 
is scarcely in all Scripture such a strong ground of 
evidence against the Jews. But since they have 
already become ashamed of their error, | do not know 
what foolish things they are inventing and dreaming 
up for themselves a third house. But the text clearly 
says about this last temple, which they saw, since 
Haggai already prophesied that the glory of this 
temple would be much greater.

than that of the previous one. This glory could not 
consist of gold or silver or any exceedingly precious 
things, since the first temple was built much richer and 
more splendidly, but it is a spiritual glory, which came 
into being through the preaching of the gospel. All this 
is fulfilled in Christ 2c. 


V. 1. On the fourth and twentieth day of the ninth 
month. 

So far we have finished three sermons of Haggai, 
which he preached to the people at different times, 
now the fourth one follows here. In it, the Spirit exhorts 
tthe prophet not only to the fearful, but also to the 
weary. This challenge tends to be the first one, when 
we take care of divine things and of what is 
commanded by the Word of God, because Satan 
does not cease to attack us with all kinds of 
adversities. Then, when he sees that he is mistaken 
in this expectation, that he is unable to do anything on 
the left, he turns to the right in order to turn us away 
from the works of God through shameful idleness and 
sleepiness, because in this way he attacks us with 
certainty if we do not open our eyes sufficiently and 
are careful. And this is certainly not the least 
challenge that requires more admonition than if we 
are publicly wicked. Therefore, this whole sermon is 
directed against the safety of the people, and in this 
way the prophet comes to the question of the "holy 
flesh," as the text says, in which the prophet punishes 
carelessness and sleepiness, and _ reproaches 
punishments. God wants us to hasten the 
undertaking, to do the work with alacrity, otherwise, if 
we do not do with alacrity the thing that God has 
commanded us to do, God will dislike even that which 
is otherwise so good. But here he uses a different kind 
of exhortation than above, as we see. 


Vv. 13. 14. If someone wore holy flesh in his 
garment 2c. 


"In the garments", that is, in the outermost part and 
the tails of the garment. - This question has two parts: 
whether the flesh sanctifies the garment, and whether 
an unclean person makes unclean. Because this does 
not happen by nature. 





1730 L. XXVII, 41S s. Interpretations on the prophets. 


That is why the priests are asked, so that they pass 
judgment according to the law. For by nature everything 
is pure, because they are good creatures of God. But the 
law makes a distinction between clean and unclean 
things, and says that the unclean makes everything 
unclean, as is written in the third book of Moses. But how 
things are sanctified is also sawn there. Therefore the 
priests could easily answer. With this question, however, 
the prophet recently intended to wake up and incite the 
tired and sleepy people, as | said above. Therefore he 
used a new figure of speech to make them attentive, as 
good teachers are wont to thuu, that they irritate the 
listeners with new objects, so that they become lively 
and attentive to the matter 2c. But he makes an 
application with the last question. 


V. 15. 1) So are these full and these people before 
me, 


As if he wanted to say: Everything that therefore 
touches this people is unclean before me. Namely, he 
admonishes the sluggish people, who seemed to be 
holy, while they were unclean, because the temple was 
not yet completed, as if he wanted to say: If you want to 
be clean, hurry up with the building of the temple, 
complete the temple, otherwise you will not be sanctified 
by the holy thing, rather, because you are unclean, you 
also defile the temple, which is holy in itself. In the same 
way, the apostle Paul, in his letter to the Corinthians, 
brings together strange reasons of proof, which have 
been very carefully and meticulously filed, in order to 
remove certainty and drowsiness from their hearts, just 
as Haggai has weighed the matter most conscientiously 
and precisely, and yet he even combines the purity of 
faith with legal purity. God had promised, therefore these 
promises required faith, otherwise the promises, without 
faith, are not promises for us 2c. 


And all the work of their hands, and what they offer 
is unclean. 

That is, not only what they do outside of worship, but 
also what they do in worship. 


1) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 


1731 


Even what they do in the service of God, which they think 
pleases God, does not please God, because they lack 
faith and want to be satisfied by legal justice, which God 
does not approve of. For to neglect faith and justice is 
something greater than to let legal things stand in the 
way, as Christ also says [Matt. 9:13, 12:7]: "I am well 
pleased with mercy, and not with sacrifice." "The hardest 
thing in the law is judgment, mercy, and faith. This should 
be done, and that should not be left undone." [Matth. 23, 
23.] It is therefore the opinion of this passage: you are 
unclean, although you are clean according to the law. 
Here we see that works do not cleanse, likewise that 
works without faith are absolutely nothing before God, 
because everything that does not come from faith is sin 
[Rom. 14:23]. This is a harsh judgment against all saints 
of works who praise their own works and righteousness. 


V. 16. And now look how you have fared since that 
day and before 2c. 


He repeats what he said above in the first chapter [v. 5, 
7] and reminds them of the damage they had suffered 
and the past misfortune, so that they might believe the 
prophet more easily, bearing in mind the past 
misfortunes. And this passage is quite literal, as we 
generally say, "Fools must be loused with pistons." For 
this is the nature of the lowly great hemp, that it needs 
violence and blows. So also Christ says [Matth. 11, 17.]: 
"We whistled at you, and you would not dance" 2c. 


V. 17. [That when one came to the grain heap 2c.] 


Thus the prophet speaks here as if to say: If you will not 
be instructed by promises, you will be instructed by 
plagues.

The more they are chastised, the more they become 
obdurate, which we can clearly see today in the 
Jews, who stubbornly hold on to their vain hope and 
opinion. And the stubbornness makes them 
invincible; they do not acknowledge their guilt, just as 
the papists are not moved by plagues or signs to 
believe the Gospel of the great God. 

V.19. Look at it now, from this day and before. 

He repeats the same thing that he said above [v. 
16], for this is the way of the Hebrew language, that 
it often repeats the same thing, as we see that this 
happened very often in Moses. Here our 
commentators raise a question about the month, but 
| do not know if this serves any purpose. Haggai 
began to prophesy in the sixth month on the first day 
1) as the title of the prophecy indicates, and at that 
time the foundation of the temple was laid. Therefore, 
he commands to hasten the matter, to carry out the 
prophesying with alacrity, it is the time for the fruits to 
come forth. 


Of the ninth moon. 


This would be in January for us because they start 
the year with the month of March. Also

September they call the beginning of the year, as it is

account comes in April or May. 


V. 22. Tell Zerubbabel, the prince of Judah 2c. 


At the end a promise of Zerubbabel is added. The 
Lord proclaims this for the comfort of both the king 
and the people. The same change is proclaimed 
here, which was proclaimed above [v. 7] about the 
change of all things, which happens through the word 
of the gospel in the hearts and consciences of men. 


V. 24.2) | will keep you like a pity ring, for | have 
chosen you. 


Quasi signaculum, that is, like a signet ring. - "For 
| have chosen thee." This does not apply both to the 
person of the King and to that of Christ, who was born 
from his loins, "for salvation comes from the Jews," 
as John [Cap. 4, 22.] says. Now Christ, who was 
taken from the Jews, changed everything by his 
future, namely, by the preaching of the Gospel. For 
while Zerubbabel lived, this change did not take 
place, but after his death, since Christ, the new King, 
was now born. To Him be praise and glory. Amen.

Zwickau manuscript. *) 
From Luther's lectures, which began on September 11, 1525, and were probably completed in the same month. Printed 


in 1886. 


Translated from Latin. 


[Preface] on Haggai. 


This prophet is probably the easiest of all, and if 
the matter is considered without the right attitude of 
heart, his prophecy seems to be small, especially in 
our times, when the kingdom of the Jews has already 
been destroyed and the temple destroyed. For it 
seems foolish that the Lord should raise up so 
excellent a prophet for the sake of the rebuilding of 
the temple. For the temple was a natural thing, and 
yet the divine majesty allows itself to make so many 
words because of such a small object (materiam). 
Therefore, both the thing and the position of the heart 
must not be considered. For in all things the divine 
will must always be considered. If GOD would 
command the very least work, in His eyes such a 
work is no less than the greatest, because by the 
divine will all things receive weight. Human reason 
looks at the greatness and quantity of works, the 
Word does not consider them. Faith acts in the 
opposite way, knowing that it is the work of the same 
God to command great and small things. In both 
kinds of works, it is incumbent upon us to look at the 
truth of God and the Word. 

The time of the prophet was under the king 
Darius. Knowledge of history is required here.

This, however, is different, so that nothing certain can 
be determined. Josephus counts many kings of the 
Persians, Philo few; there is still dispute among the 
historians about the number of kings of the Persians. 
You have the table in which | have arranged these 
years with the greatest possible care. The diversity of 
the names (vocabulorum) has caused the diversity of 
the history, because one king had two, even three 
names. The Latin and Greek histories call Cambyses 
the son of Cyrus, this great Cyrus. In Josephus, 
however, he is constantly called Cambyses. 2) In the 
book of Judith [Cap. 1, 6.] he is called 
Nebucadnezzar. Nehemiah [Ezra 4, 7. 23.] calls him 
Artaxerxes ["Arthahsastha"], [the Greeks call him] 3) 
Xerxes. Judith was under Cambyses, who sent 
Holofernes. The king Cyrus reigned .two years with 
Darius [ with whom united he overcame the 
Belshazzar]. 4) This very powerful king he killed at the 
council of Arphaxad. In the history of Judith [Cap. 1, 
1. 6.] Arphaxad is mentioned. This [Cyrus'] son was 
Cambyses. The fourth [king], Darius shat den 
Beinamens Langhand. So much is enough to 
understand this prophecy. One calls

Darius Hystaspis 1) in Daniel (Cap. 5, 31.), who is said 
to have died before Cyrus, longhand. He was until the 
reign of Cyrus. It is clear who we are talking about. (It is 
he,) under whom the kingdom of the Persians began, 
who with Cyrus killed the last king of the Babylonians 
and captured him (sic!). After he died, Cyrus or Cyrus 
alone succeeded him. He ruled alone for twenty-two 
years. He gave the Jews a very broad permission to 
return to Jerusalem, as is written in the book of Ezra. 
Since he had gone out to Scythia against his rebellious 
chief Arphachad, he was killed by the queen Tomyris. In 
the meantime, the returned Jews tried to rebuild the 
temple, but they could not, not only because the pagans 
came and resisted them with a violent hand, but also 
because after the death of Cyrus Cambyses succeeded, 
a haughty man. The Greeks call him Xerxes, the 
Scriptures Artaxerxes. He forbade by a public order that 
Jerusalem be built. Thus the work on the house of the 
Lord was omitted under Cambyses. Thus the promise, 
by which he (Cyrus) gave them permission, seems to 
have been kept nothing, because nothing was 
accomplished, except that they returned to Judea. 


1) Here, our original leaves much to be desired. Unfortunately, 
Luther's table, to which he refers, is no longer available, therefore it 
is not possible for us to bring light and order into this confused 
relation. The Hall manuscript also has hystaspis. - According to 
Luther's (Mronwon of 1541, this is the sequence of the Persian kings: 
1. Darius Medus together with Cyrus. 2. Cyrus alone. In the absence 
of Cyrus, Cambysns reigns seven years. 3. Artaxerxes, Priscus 
Ahasverus, the son of Hystaspis, also called Darius, the husband of 
Esther. 4. Darius Longimanus. Beginning of the weeks in Daniel [Cap. 
9, 1.].Whereas here, according to both the Zwickau and Hallic 
manuscripts, this seems to be the order. 1. Darius Hystaspis (which 
is Darius Meduss. 2. Cyrus. 3. Cambyses. 4. Darms Longimanus. 
This is confirmed by what Luther himself says in the interpretation of 
Zechariah: "Dieweil Kores (the first king in Persians in Scythia moved, 
he left Darius Hystaspis iin land, who was with him king.... After the 
death of Cyrus came Arthasastha, who is otherwise called Artaxerxes 
or Cambyses, and Ahasuerus Priscus, who became captain of 
Holofernes.... After this came the third king Darius Longimanus, of 
whom Zechariah and Haggai speak here."

are turned back. A human king, aman had commanded, 
not God, therefore the work, although they had begun, 
was not carried out. After Cambyses died, Darius 
Longhand followed. | do not care much why he was 
called so. It is said that the cause was that he had very 
long hands. So much of the time of Darius, the next after 
Cambyses. 

Then you have that these two prophets Zechariah 
and Haggai prophesied at the same time, only that 
Haggai began two months before Zechariah. There in 
Zechariah it says: "In the eighth month", in Haggai: "In 
the sixth"; therefore Haggai is earlier than Zechariah. 
This is in Ezra in the fifth and sixth chapters (Ezra 5:1]. 
Read also Nehemiah. Philo and Josephus say that they 
prophesied at the same time. And Haggai at the end of 
the first chapter confesses it. 

One must judge the spirit and the attitude of the 
prophet. The word of God always comes in the greatest 
difficulties, because the word of God is an almighty 
power that comes only when everything seems to be in 
despair. It is not received by those who are in good 
peace, but by those with whom it stands in despair, 
because it promises unbelievable and impossible things, 
so that the mouth of the world and of the flesh may be 
shut, that it may not boast that it has begun, but must 
confess (that it would have been unable to do anything) 
if it had not been for the Lord. Look at the circumstances, 
and you will see an exceedingly great work in the spirit. 
They are commanded a very small work in appearance, 
but see what enemies the Jews and Zerubbabel have to 
fight against, since so great princes resist them in the 
building of the temple. That is to begin a quite impossible 
thing. In Ezra you see how hostile the neighboring 
nations were without the king's commission, and that is 
alot. Read the history of the Greeks about the arrogance 
of this king. Yes, it is something great that Zerubbabel 
and others set themselves against the king. Cambyses 
threw gold into the sea; he wanted to be mightier than 
Neptune. He connects the ships (to a bridge) through 
the black sea, 3) he measures the people like wheat;

this exceedingly pompous king reigned, and yet 
[Haggai] prophesied. Here one’ must look at the 
greatness of the spirit, not at the insignificance of the 
works. In a very small thing this prophet speaks 
exceedingly great things, because he awakens the 
hearts and the spirit exceedingly powerful against the 
strongest and most powerful king, as if | would sit 
down against the Turk today. Cambyses was 
stronger then than the Turk is nowadays. Behold, 
how soon God assists His own! While these believe/ 
Cambyses dies. Darius follows; God made him 
exceedingly kind to the Jews, and the commands 
against the Jews turn into the most peaceful ones for 
the Jews.

transformed. Before with violent hand was resisted 
that the Jews should not build: the colonels write, the 
Jews build. One looks after the book from [Ezra 6, 
1.,f.* and so it is found. This seemed impossible, 
afterwards it was quite easy. This seems very easy 
to us when we look at the spirit. The exceedingly 
hard ordinance is changed into a very kind one. 
Where does this change come from? From heaven. 
The whole world may be against us, 1) if God is for 
us 2c., Rom. 8, 31. If this were preached to us, few 
would believe, as then few believed Haggai.

V. 2. The people say: the time has not yet come. 


The prophet begins with scolding, as is the way of all 
prophets, then follows the prophet's sweet 
consolation. The devil has the opposite way: first he 
walks sweetly to deceive, after that he leaves a stink 
behind him. God first terrifies and leads to hell, then 
he exalts. This is the way of the divine word and work, 
that he destroys before he builds. The devil does it 
the other way around. It is a scolding because of 





of negligence in building the house of the Lord. He 
repeats the words of the people [with which they 
excuse their] negligence in building. They want to 
say: 2) Under the reign of Cyrus we have begun [to 
build] both the temple and Jerusalem, but the nations 
resist us. We remain in the land, [but] we are very 
poor. Therefore, it is not God's will that [through us]

abandon the work of God and retreat because they 
are resisted. They will never accomplish it, because 
that means to look back and leave the plow, but it 
must be broken through all power, because the 
service of God stands in His word, which is a power 
of God. He who has this resists [all the raging of the 
world). 1) Therefore, you are not allowed to excuse 
yourself from your profession because you are 
resisted. For God's work rises the more it is resisted. 
This passage shows that no one is excused from his 
office, from the service of God, because he resists it.

The more the work of God is driven back, the more it 
breaks through. Therefore, because Israel's 
negligence is reprehensible, He raises up for Israel 
two who stimulate it, 2) Haggai and Zechariah, so that 
they may be sure of divine protection. 


V. 4. But your time has come to dwell in paneled 
houses. 


You see how he describes the unbelief and 
carelessness of the people. They had attacked the 
work at the same time with the word of GOD and faith, 
since they began to build. [But now] they set before 
them the king of the Persians, Cambyses (for Cyrus 
had been killed), the multitude of those who resist 
them: there faith grows dull, there they do not look to 
the LORD 2c. He who wants to look at death and fight 
with it is defeated. He who always lets himself be 
frightened never overcomes the enemy, but one must 
turn one's gaze away from death and look at life, look 
at righteousness, not at sin. The Psalm says: "I am 
not afraid of many things.

thou mayest be stouthearted. "If a man may take a 
thing into his mind, he may do it." When courage is 
lacking, one's strength wanes. That is what it says 
here. When they look at the power of men, they 
despair; when they look at the power of God, they 
overcome. Behold, O Jews, how unreasonable you 
are! You say it is not the time to build my house; with 
you it is being built. 4) It is all carelessness and 
stinginess. Why do you not look at the rulers who 
resist when you build houses for yourselves?

praise or disparagement of the houses. It must be

construction of the house, and | do not believe that it 
was the custom of the Jews to have vaulted houses. 
They had the houses above with a flat roof, Matth. 10, 
27. He wants to say: You see my house standing 
desolate, that there is no one working; it stands 
deserted, it has no roof. You make sure that you have 
roofs on the houses; mine is in the open air and rain. 
"Desolate,” that is, forsaken by men.

wants to add: From the punishment itself you could 
have known that you are sinners. You are wretched; 
this happens because you sin against me, | am 
turned away from you. The kingdom of God is 
whimsical. "He makes it whimsical,” and acts in such

exceedingly rich promises; coming into the land, they 
have opposition from Cambyses the king and from 
the neighboring heathen. Unhappy are they in all 
things: in vain do they reap and sow; "is this to "keep" 
the" promises? Who should not despair, since he so 
foolishly fulfills his promises that we see nothing less 
(than the fulfillment)? "It takes much patience” for 
anyone to stay with this GOtte. And they had such 
great promises, as also in Zechariah. And he does all 
these things to make his counsel marvelous against 
free will, that they may see that they do nothing by 
their undertaking, by their counsel, 1) that faith may 
be gladdened, and that all may know and say: Our 
hand does nothing; the more we have done, the less 
we have accomplished. He made the people know (a 
very great experience) that they could do nothing, so 
that they would not boast that they were the ones who 
rebuilt the temple; rather, he made them fall into 
despair, pusillanimity and weakness of faith, so that 
they would say: When the matter stood in despair, 
when we were nothing, God came and gave His word 
and power, that we might do it-"As you are." What is 
meant by this? 


V. 6. you sow much, and bring in little 2c. 


This is a plague. That is, you have had little to eat. 
He does not deny that they have eaten, but not 
enough to be full. 


And who earns money. 


Those who wanted to collect treasures, when they 
sold their goods, did nothing else but put them into a 
box, into a bag "that has no bottom”. It is not a sack 
for grain, but one in which treasure is stored.

That is, when they wanted to collect treasures, so 
great hardships came that they were forced to

were to be taken out. And that is where the proverbial 
image comes from: to put the money into a bag full 
of holes, "the bottom is out of the bag", to put the 
money into a crushed bag full of holes. All this is done 
because of the kingdom to come. For they do not set 
up the temple and the services for their own sake and 
for the sake of that service, but for the sake of the 
future Christ, so that God would be true. The Lord 
urges despair above all things, that God may be 
glorified who raises the dead. 


V. 7: See how you are doing. 


He reminds them of the punishment. This is a 
repetition. And so you will find that the fault is not in 
the time, because the time of rebuilding has already 
been there for a long time, but in you, because (the 
time) has been there for a long time. You should have 
believed me and the word (as it says in Jeremiah 
(Cap. 22, 29.)), after that also bravely attack the 
cause. Here now follow sweet promises after the 
rebuke, the second part of the prophecy. - 2) "Thus 
says the LORD of hosts." This is for the sake of 
repetition, which the Scriptures often do in order to 
add something else. Thus here. Since he had already 
said it once above, he repeats here again: Therefore, 
since you see (how it is for you), 3) or: if you do this, 


V. 8 Go to the mountains and cut wood. 


The word is applied here to a human work. With 
God, no work is valid unless it is confirmed by God's 
word, by which it is certain that everything man does 
is pleasing to God. If we are without the Word, we are 
uncertain; indeed, certain that we are not pleasing to 
God. This is how God wants to act with us, so that 
He Himself will be certain, and we will be certain that 
we are rightly based on God's Word. If man acts 
without the Word, he is a very miserable being, since 
everything is uncertain. On the other hand, the work 
is exceedingly blissful, then man breaks through and 
is subject to everything (, if

he has the word]: even though he has offense and 
the work has little good prosperity, yet he knows that 
the work itself is pleasing to God. So Paul, when he 
preached the gospel, however great his weakness, 
yet knew that the gospel was pleasing to God. Thus, 
even though we are unclean, we are certain that God 
is pleased with our preaching. The same happens to 
this people because they have the word of God. Lyra 
interprets the mountain from the mountain of 
Lebanon. | do not think so; | would rather understand 
it from Mount Moriah, that is, from the mountain of 
the house of the LORD, which is called in Scripture 
the mountain of the house of GOD or of the LORD, 
Isa. 2:2 ff. Micah 4:1, that is, from the place where 
the temple is built, and was to be built. - "Bring wood" 
to this mountain. These are contemptible words, 
because they deal with the preached history, but 
beautiful, when one looks at how glorious a thing a 
work is, which is confirmed by the word of God. Now 
follows a very sweet promise. 


I want that to be pleasant. 


That is, | will be well pleased with this house. Luc. 
2, 14.: [Peace on earth [and good will toward men], 
good pleasure. Matth. 17, 5.: "This is my beloved 
Son, in whom | am well pleased." These stones and 
the wood and the mountain and the place were 
nothing, they were creatures without feeling, but 
grace was with them because He adds: "This shall 
be acceptable unto me." This comforted them; who 
else would rely with confidence on this wood, as the 
Jews did? But because the Lord says, Here shall my 
good will be, the hypocritical Jews took this place 
very much, so that they deceived the people by the 
sacrifices. Behold, Stephen, Christ speak against the 
temple, which is a blatant blasphemy. Whose mind 
should not be caught, since this passage was 
attracted: God is well pleased with this place? 
Therefore they accused Stephen [Apost. 6, 13.]: 
"This man does not stop speaking blasphemous 
words against the holy place" 2c. A very apparent 
reason for proof! God has provided for us that the 
pope should not have such strong grounds for proof, 
as the 


1745 


Jews hold. To fight with the word of God against the 
word of God requires a great spirit. But with one word 
the prophet explains himself how far this prophecy is 
to be understood. The Jews were promised the 
kingdom of Christ, to which all the preceding, all the 
prophecies should be referred 2c. Since the Scripture 
says that God is well pleased 2c., they should not 
have misinterpreted it as referring to His temple. 
Below the prophet interprets "how far he wants to 
have the saying”. 


And will show my honor. 

That is, | will show great glory there. This promise 
was made in order to gather the people, so that they 
would be sure of the outward sign of what God's will 
was. Thus, through our signs, through baptism and 
the Lord's Supper, we are certain that God has His 
glory and His gospel [here]; where this is, there is 
God's pleasure. Thus says the prophet (ille [Haggai 
2, 8. 10.]), so that the promise of Christ may not 
completely perish: | will make the house there 
glorious, and you will see great glory there. The first 
house had great glory, that is, it was an exceedingly 
costly, splendid building, Zephaniah Cap. 3, 1) a 
great multitude of the people [came together there, it 
was] a great service. The same glory or greater was 
in this house, though the building of the temple was 
not so delectable. Josephus describes it well. The 
temple had only one gate. Two hundred men closed 
it; see Josephus. It must have been built in the most 
magnificent way. The service was very splendid on 
this occasion. 2) In the time of the kings all nations 
were hostile to the Jews. After the captivity, where 
they had no kings, the Gentiles were also hostile to 
them, but by God's providence people from all 
nations came together, as can be seen from Acts 
Cap. 2. This had not happened before at the time of 
the first house, that they came together there. This 
was because the Jews, who were

they drew and led along the Gentiles among whom 
they dwelt. "I will show my honor, that you may be 
sure, that you may have a firm and well-founded 
conscience. 


V. 9 For you are waiting for much, and behold, it will 
be little. 


The prophet throws his sermon whimsically 
through each other. He had said v. 7. f.], "See how 
you fare, and go up into the mountain." For he returns 
to what he said above. That is, ye expected that much 
corn and oil should grow. You look at your ways and 
see your punishment. God indicates how easily he 
could prevent even the yield of the present year, the 
present abundance. When the cellars are full 2c., | 
blow into them. As if he wanted to say: "It costs me 
no more than that | breathe into it", Gen. 2, 7. that is,

how easily he could bless the present lack! | have 
blown into your abundance, that is, 1) even though 
you had wine in the cellar, | have given it to perish or 
that you could not use it. Why? Because my house is 
desolate. - "Ye make haste," that is, ye are but 
diligent in the care of your own affairs.

The people heard that this word was not spoken 
without fruit. Isa. 55, 3) 11. He indicates what fruit it 
has produced among the people. 


V. 12. Then Zerubbabel obeyed. 


The fruit of the word. They heard, that is, they 
believed and received the word with benefit. Then 
they feared the Lord, that is, they were reverent 
toward Him, they became willing to do what God had 
commanded. This fruit would not have followed if it 
had not been for the promises in which he said that 
he was well pleased with the house, 4) which 
provoked the people and made the people willing. If 
it had been only words of the law, this fruit would not 
have followed. Seeing their willingness and 
obedience, he adds more promises.

who had the message of the LORD. 5) 


| would have liked the translator to replace the 
word 1*? with the Greek word 
[ayyiAog, angel) would have been 
expressed because the interpreters indicate a human 
being. In Malachi [Cap. 3, 11 it says, "Behold, | send 
my angel before thee," 1*?, a messenger 6) of the 
LORD, because he is an angel of the LORD. The 
Latin interpreter translated: angelum, and Matth. 11, 
10. it says of John the Baptist: "Behold, | send my 
angel before you." Luc. 9, 52.: Since Christ walked to 
Jerusalem], he sent angels (angelum [in Greek: 
dAAouc]) before him. This is how it should have been 
translated here. For so is this word "angel" in use, 
Latin: nuntius. Make no difference whether it is a man 
or a spirit, a spirit of God, [or a spirit] of Satan.

1748 L- XXVII, 366-368. interpretation of Haggai (2.), Cap. 1, 13. 14. 


1749 





The prophets, the apostles are called angels. Those 
who bring the word of God are angels of God, those 
who bring the word of Satan are angels of Satan, 2 
Cor. 11, 13. 14. If the Latin interpreter had said 
"angels", it would have sounded much more majestic. 
He wants to say: At the time when the prophet Haggai 
began to prophesy, there were others who 
prophesied the same. The prophecy is written about 
two of them, Haggai and Zechariah. When the word 
begins, there are several who prophesy at the same 
time; one or both were the most prominent. As if to 
say: Haggai was the first angel, from whom many 
were begotten. It is a great honor that a man, who is 
dust, should have this title in common with the 
angels, the heavenly spirits. 2 Cor. 5:20: "We are 
therefore ambassadors in Christ's stead," because 
we have the word which he commanded us and put 
in our mouths, that we should bring it among men. 
Now he calls himself an angel, before a prophet, for 
the sake of humility. | believe that he uses the 
majestic name because the people to whom he was 
sent had accepted the word. What is the promise? 


') lam with you. 

This is ashort sermon. This chapter is not finished 
in one sermon. The first sermon he did when he said 
[v. 2]: "The time is not yet here"; the second [v. 4]: 
"But your time is here" 2c. There are two sermons. 
One began here [v. 13.]: [Then said Haggai,] the 
angel [of the HErrnft He gives only the subject of the 
sermons; how he interpreted it he does not write; the 
sermon is only implied. This is a glorious sermon: If 
he who is "God with us" (Emanuel) is with us, what 
need is there for us to hear, teach, do more? God is 
with you, he will say everything, he will defend you, 
he will make you safe; now no one can harm you, 
because God can harm no one 2c., Rom. 8, 38. f. 
These are exceedingly comprehensive words and full 
of the spirit, and they 


1) Already here, the Weimar has the verse number "14." 





are pure spirit. Without a doubt, these words have 
been further elaborated by the prophet. Run follows 
this sermon, which fruit had followed it. 


V. 14. And the Lord raised the spirit of Zerubbabel. 


Here you see two beautiful things: that it was not 
enough that this word was spoken, but within was the 
Spirit who taught, Joh. 6, 44. By heart the angel 
Haggai preaches and says: Behold the Lord. But this 
word would not have entered the heart if it had not 
been the Holy Spirit within. Therefore it follows: "He 
awakened," so that they attacked the work 2c. [This 
serves against our prophets who despise the outward 
word. It is a good passage against our unrhymed 
prophets, who boast much of the Spirit, as if the 
outward word were nothing to be delivered by the 
angels. This proclaimed word is followed by the spirit, 
which writes into the hearts of the listeners what the 
angel speaks to the ears 2c. 


Zerubbabel and Joshua did not do it out of their 
own impulse, that they had only heard it, but God 2c. 
When the word of God is spoken, it is not enough to 
do any good, for what can nature do? Those who are 
jealous praise free will, while here the Scripture says: 
It is not enough to hear the word, for the awakening 
of the spirit is also necessary. "The spirit" in Latin is 
animus, in German "Muth", quite actually in Greek 
Quyds. We use it in various ways: of wrath, "He has a 
courage," of the hopeful, of the wrathful, of the 
courageous, that is, of intrepid people. In Hebrew: 
"spirit." Therefore, when He blows us up with His 
Spirit, He makes us courageous, bold, people who 
break through, who are not driven back by any 
obstacles. "He awakened the spirit," "he gave it a 
courage" to work. It is not enough that one know it, 
desire it, but that one submit to it. In the things that 
are God's we are weak, but when the Comforter 
comes,’ he strengthens us.

The second chapter. 


V. 1. On the fourth and twentieth day of the sixth 
month. 


"On the fourth and twentieth day of the sixth 
month" and [v. 2.] "on the one and twentieth day of 
the seventh month,” how does this agree with each 
other? On the first day of the sixth month he began 
to prophesy. This is a great question. March is the 
first month among the Hebrews; the Hebrews begin 
the year according to nature (annum naturalem). 
That sixth month was [our] August, when the apples 
are ripe. He preached until the twenty-fourth day of 
the sixth month, more than three weeks, and under 
preaching he gained people to help him preach. Now 
how are we to reconcile these two pieces? It pleases 
Lyra that this piece must be connected with the 
previous chapter. And this is done, as follows in the 
text, so that it is indicated that the prophet had 
preached for three weeks and three days with his 
comrades. Zechariah, who began in the eighth 
month, is not yet present. He wanted to indicate that 
on this twenty-fourth day of the sixth month the 
foundations were laid. 


V. 2. On the one and twentieth day of the seventh 
month. 


Here begins a new sermon and a new chapter, 
otherwise it cannot be brought into agreement with 
each other. In Hebrew they are different verses. 
Those who have printed the Hebrew Bible have 
differentiated the chapters according to the Latin 
translation; in the old [Bibles] they are not so 
differentiated. Here the prophet begins to exhort in a 
different way and to strengthen this people. 1) Why 
he did this, you see in Ezra [Cap. 4, 4. ff.], because 
when they began to build, a disturbance arose, as it 
is written in Ezra [Cap. 4, 23.]: the neighboring 
peoples and the rulers, who by the king 


1) Here we have taken instead :60Q- 


tortare. 


of the Chaldeans came to Jerusalem 2c. Such is the 
nature of the word of God: as soon as we have 
begun, as soon as we are prepared, 2) the temptation 
follows. As soon as Christ is baptized, he is driven 
into the wilderness, tempted 2c. It is the same with 
Christians. As soon as Satan sees the light, the word 
of God, rising, he immediately sees that this flame will 
now consume his kingdom, therefore he strives to 
extinguish it and does not see that he is only fanning 
it even more 2c. This is what happened to this people 
2c. If they had built a hundred thousand temples, 
Satan would not have cared; but that this happened 
in the name and according to the word of God, so that 
they could believe and be saved at all, and had 
connected the word with the temple, that meant the 
destruction of Satan's kingdom. He could not stand 
that, otherwise Satan would not have cared about the 
temples. Here the shepherds must watch 2c., "stop" 
the faithful people. It is a long and very beautiful 
sermon that now follows, which he delivers to the 
believing people to strengthen them. Thus those who 
preside over the words must stir up the people, "this 
is 3) the sermon," lest they become fainthearted by 
the greatness of the work and the opposition of the 
opponents. "On the one and twentieth day of the 
seventh month.” The prophet assigns his sermons to 
different times, and in this second chapter he seems 
to begin about his third sermon, as he ended two in 
the first chapter. Therefore, he continues to comfort 
the people, so that they may know that manifold 
promises of the future Christ are still remaining; for 
this reason, the Spirit pours himself out completely in 
this sermon. In the previous prophets there was not 
such a prophecy proclaiming Christ as close as this 
one does, so that he would comfort the weak, Luc. 1, 
54, 68, and restore Israel.

1753 





V. 4. 1) [Who is left among you 2c.] 


The prophet begins the consolation in the way of 
a concession. He admits that the matter seems 
desperate to those 2) who were left. For seventy 
years [the captivity] lasted, and many little and 
innocent children were led away, as Daniel, who 
seems to have lived almost until the return. The 
captivity continued until Darius, the son of Hystaspis. 
Next, all agree that Mordecai, the uncle [of Esther 
(Esther 2, 7.)], returned, who had been led back from 
captivity. And Ezra [Cap. 2, 2.] enumerates his name, 
but, whether it be he, | know not. So the prophet 
admits that after the weakness of their faith [it seems 
impossible] that the house of GOD will be restored to 
its former glory. It is the same with us. When God 
begins something, He begins it childishly, so that the 
adversaries laugh, as the pagans said to Nehemiah 
when he built the walls [Nehem. 4:3] that foxes would 
jump over. So he starts his works with foolishness, 
but at the end he shows how he was made. So there 
were many believers here who had seen the first 
house, and when they saw that the thing was begun 
under such desperate circumstances, they said: We 
have acted in vain, let us desist from the work. But 
there is a great need in this people and in the work of 
God. There is need of the Spirit to make us stop, to 
make us dare; only in the name of the Lord and at His 
word will it come to pass that the whole world will be 
astonished. Never does the word of God come other 
than in adversity. And from this circumstance the 
attitude of those who hear the word of God can be 
inferred. He does not speak to the full, but to the 
hungry. [Here*s you have a despairing people who 
think everything is impossible. Let your weakness 
depart, only dare, and you will see the glory.

V. 5. 6. And now, Zerubbabel, be of good cheer. 


The heart of the leader, the priest of the people, 
has also wavered because the cause stood in 
despair. That prevents us. [It would be quite different 
if we stopped all senses and turned away from the 
matter, and simply paid attention to the word of God 
2c. Reason directs its attention to the thing in front of 
it before it looks at the word. God gives words that go 
against the senses; he speaks in such a way that he 
makes everything out of nothing 2c. We want to feel, 
he does not want to be felt. Those who were to build 
did not see gold; the rest of the Jews are still among 
the Gentiles, so their hearts are full of unbelief. Would 
to God that these examples would encourage us in 
our distress. The Word alone can sustain us, through 
which He directed the creation. 3) 


For | am with you. 


He repeats the same sermon s that he preached 
Cap. 1, 13: "Then said Haggai],the angel" 2c. to 
increase and strengthen the promise and comfort. 
These are exceedingly mighty and fiery words to 
encourage their hearts. To you who are terrified 4) |, 
God, will give the Gentiles, | am stronger than they. 
He reminds them of the words he used when they left 
Egypt, "I will be your God, and you shall be my 
people," to encourage their hearts. It is a great 
comfort that he does not speak of some alone, as in 
the New Testament, in which he does not separate a 
people, because in the Old Testament his people is 
one church. In the New Testament, those who believe 
are his people. He considered them [the Israelites] his 
people only in the sense that they were of the flesh of 
Abraham. He bore their ungodliness, he brought out 
the godly and ungodly [Egyptians?, he gave to all. 
This is to show that he is willing to preserve this carnal 
people. | still want to preserve you until the kingdom 
of Christ. You shall know that you are such a people 
as | have made you.

out of Egypt. Paul says in the Acts of the Apostles 
[Cap. 13, 18.]: "He tolerated their ways." Here the 
prophet names the whole people, the godly and the 
godless, because God had at the same time decided 
to protect the godly for the sake of faith, the godless 
out of divine patience, and to distribute his benefits 
out of grace for the sake of the godly. Now therefore 
the prince [Zerubbabel] and the high priest [Joshua] 
are sure that all belong to God, and that he will take 
care of them, even if they are ungodly. Of this we 
cannot boast. He preserves some city for the sake of 
the godly, but this does not help the weak 
conscience. Though some may have the Holy Spirit, 
the godly were not the greater part. The greater part 
shall not be able to say: it happened for our sake, but] 
God does not say: | will reject, but, | will bear for the 
sake of the coming Christ; it is my endurance, as 
before. He says all this for the comfort of the godly. 
In Sodom he would spare for the sake of ten 
[righteous] 2c. But we do not have such a promise, 
even though [God still spares] for the sake of a few 
righteous people. Or we are not given the assurance 
of what God wants to do. Now he makes this people 
certain that the thing shall succeed, because he 
wants to regard his word and his promise, not their 
piety. 


V. 6. My Spirit shall remain among you. 

He will be your sustainer (stator), that is, | will give 
you a steadfast courage, that is, he will be strong in 
you, [give] a strong, bold, confident heart 2c. 


Do not be afraid. 1) 


These are exceedingly lovely and sweet words. If 
anyone has this for himself, whom should he fear? 
The sins make, the spirit downcast; this also he takes 
away, when he takes away the sin. 2)

V. 7. There is yet a little, that | may move heaven and 
earth, and the sea, and the dry land. 


Here you see why he is wearing: he wanted to 
keep the covenant that was made in Egypt. | do not 
look at your merits, but the main reason is that | look 
at the future kingdom of Christ, which is promised to 
you, who will come from your seed. Here he clearly 
proclaims the kingdom of Christ, so that they may 
know that they will remain until Christ. This passage 
convinces all Jews that Christ has come, and that it 
is none other than ours. Rather, God says, "There is 
yet a little one." He makes them certain with clear 
words that this people is to be considered as such a 
people as he led them out of Egypt. Therefore it was 
impossible that this carnal people should be changed 
until Christ should come. Now the Jews may see 
what they can say against this text. They have been 
scattered since the birth of Christ, they have neither 
a duke nor a priest. And the very clear experience is 
with the text. If the text were not 3) true, the Jews 
would have to be together, or have a prince, a 
prophet, who announced/announced to them the end 
of the captivity, as Daniel, Zechariah and Haggai 
were at that time. The people were preserved by the 
word at that time. They don't have that; they don't 
have the custom of the law, not the prophets who 
would like to sustain them with the word and 
announce the end of the captivity. It follows inevitably 
that Christ has come, 4) or the prophet is lying, which 
is impossible. Over a little | will transform all things, is 
a paraphrase, so that it is a declaration of what | have 
said. Therefore [it follows] that also this covenant will 
last except for this little one, until | will change 
everything. | will preserve all things except the little 
things. "Heaven" [say the interpreters, that is the 
angels [Luc. 2:15.] "The earth.” If Luc. 2, 1. [the

make? 1) The prophets do not say much about the birth 
[of Christ], but all speak of his kingdom 2c., as Christ 
says Matt. 11:12, "Of the days of John." He says [v. 13.] 
that the prophets spoke until the days of John, who is the 
end of the law and began the new testament. The 
kingdom of Christ did not begin at the birth, but when he 
was thirty years old. Daniel says [Cap. 9, 25.]: 2) "Until 
Christ the Prince", not: until His birth. That is, at the time 
Christ was baptized by John, the kingdom of Christ 
began; the voice came from heaven, soon he was led 
into the wilderness; when he returned, he began to 
preach. In baptism he is ordained king, priest, and 
teacher. In Isaiah one and the other passage [deals with] 
the contempt of Christ, but all [prophets in general have 
their refrain], 3) when Christ began to reign 2c. Christ 
began the Rene, with John the old is ended 2c. Therefore 
[this passage] is a paraphrase for the fact that everything 
has been changed. In Revelation [Cap. 21, 5.] it says: He 
makes all things new, that is, as men are made new; 
since we are changed, everything else is changed. Zero 
the earth is different, because we are not attached to 
earthly and visible things; the invisible is ours; then [are] 
all creatures [different], but finally in truth in the last 
judgment. It is an exceedingly clear text that only a little 
was left that Christ would come. The Jews cannot say 
that so great a period [of their dispersion was only] a little. 


V. 8. 4) Yes, | will move all the Gentiles. 


| will change, | will destroy the kingdom, first spiritually, 
then physically, because the gospel changes hearts 
completely. As the kingdom of the pope stood, the old

is nothing. The pope was everything. Since there is a 
different light in the hearts, there is immediately a 
different image of things. The emperors "will not keep it" 
that they want to keep the holy people unchanged. The 
hearts are changed, we think differently of things. It is 
impossible that the monasteries remain; if they should 
restore them by force, they will perish by force. 
Everything must be changed; if not, the last day does it, 
6) it happens nevertheless. Thus he moves everything 
because hearts are moved. The Roman Empire, which 
was the most powerful, did not want to suffer this change 
of things; it is destroyed from the ground up, we have 
only the empty titles of it. Why? Because it did not want 
to suffer the judgment of those hearts. If they want, it will 
be done in kindness; if they do not want, it will be done 
by force. When He begins to recite the word, "let him who 
can, duck" 2c. Since the death of Hus, the pope has 
become contemptible even to a child. Hus was very 
learned, he has not been convicted. - Hereafter | will 
make a change and melt together [this people/ with all 
pagans; it has become a new world. 


[There shall then come all the Gentiles’ consolation]

remain significant. - "He shall come." By the gospel is 
presented the desirable thing, the dignity, the stature, 
the prestige, which is acceptable to all the Gentiles, 
"a precious treasure,” which is to be spread abroad 
among all the Gentiles; not as if it were the thing 


desired (desiderium) by all the Gentiles, for they do 
not know Christ, but he extols this inestimable and 
exceedingly lovely treasure, which is Christ preached 
by the word, or an exceedingly lovely thing, which is 
to be spread abroad among all the Gentiles. For the 
prophet is signifying that another kingdom is 
prepared, which shall be spread abroad among all 
nations. This is how Christ interprets it [Luc. 24, 47], 
that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be 
preached in His name among all nations, Marc. 16, 
15. It is an impressive word, as if God speaks with a 
certain delight. He wanted to call this treasure out of 
an overflowing heart a loveliness, 1) without giving it 
a name. - ["Of all the Gentiles."] Namely, among the 
Gentiles it shall be proclaimed, spread out. "He shall 
come," as if to say, A treasure shall come, which shall 
be acceptable to many, for it is the forgiveness of sins, 
God's children become 2c. What do the Jews want to 
say against it? He says it will be, or, since the time 
was there, it was. It is a thing that will be exceedingly 
lovely, which will be made known to all the Gentiles. 
Which is it? None other than Christ. We have nothing 
from the Jews but that after this time the kingdom of 
Christ has been proclaimed. 


And | will make this house full of glory. 


Here he still receives it. At this point he indicates 
that this treasure will come from the Jews. What 
glory? Do not be fainthearted; you will remain until the 
time when 2) | will fill it with glory. At the same time | 
will give [you and the Gentiles] what is desirable, so 
that you may know that you alone are not a people.

stus will honor this temple. [But this refers] also to 
their [Mosaic] custom, because a greater worship 
was in this temple than in the first, for the sake of the 
Jews who brought their sojourners with them, but 
mainly it was to be glorified by Christ, who was GOD; 
there can be no greater “glory giving 2c. 


V. 9. For mine is both silver and gold. 


In Hebrew, the sense is ambiguous. One meaning 
is that it comforts the weak. You pusillanimous ones 
might think: Where is gold? 2c. You are poor, | am 
rich; | have abundance of gold and silver, | can well 
build the house. The Hebrews do not have the 
expression: to have a thing, but they say: to me is a 
thing, a house. So it is also said here: To me is silver, 
that is, | have silver, | will adorn the temple. The other 
view is as if to say, | will fill this house with glory, not 
with gold and silver, "I [am] not allowed gold," as it 
says in Isaiah Cap. 66, 2. "My hand has made all that 
is there," 2c. So it is said in the Psalm [Ps. 50, 8.], 
"Because of your sacrifice | do not punish you," what 
can you sacrifice to me? 2c. Have | not before? It is 
already mine. So also here, as if to turn them away 
from carnal glory and toward spiritual: | do not want 
your silver and gold; | seek another glory, not gold. | 
like this opinion quite well, but | do not reject the 
former. Burgensis has the opinion, as if he wanted to 
say: The glory will not consist in gold, but will be 
another, as follows: 


V. 10: "The glory of this last house shall be greater 
than that of the first," says the LORD of hosts, "and | 
will give peace in this place. 

Not so much gold was brought together to the last 
heap as by Solomon to the first. Therefore he 
declares that he wants this house to be filled with 
glory, that he may show that the former lacked [this] 
glory. There was a piecemeal, carnal glory, but this | 
will fill with the [right] glory. But for this 


1760 L. XXVII, 377-379. interpretation of Haggai (2.), 


| do not need gold, because | have enough. He 
therefore says of the spiritual glory that there Christ 
taught and preached, the disciples and the 
Christians. 


| want to give peace in this place. 


He simply says, "Here let it be." He says that the 
gospel shall be established in Jerusalem, that is, | will 
give the gospel, the Holy Spirit, and all that he 
indicates hereafter. Now the Jews may respond to all 
this. It is exceedingly mighty and clear against the 
Jews, not only to refute the Jews, but also to 
strengthen our consciences and faith. As the prophet 
gives his proof against them, he says it is the second 
house. There was no third to be expected, since this 
second temple stood, greater than the former by the 
glory given to it; and peace was given, and the 
people were to remain until Christ came. The long 
duration does not give glory, otherwise there would 
be great glory in hell; so also the Jews would have 
great glory, because their captivity has now lasted 
1525 years. He says [v. 8.], "I will make this house 
full of glory," which does not mean to give it a long 
duration; the glory is made full since the temple 
stood. All the syllables of the text clearly prove that 
Christ had come. Now follows the fourth sermon. 


V. 11. On the fourth and twentieth day of the ninth 
month. 


Up to this point we have heard about two or three 
sermons of the prophet, which he preached at 
different times, now the last and fourth one is left, 
which contains a kind of threat of evils, and to which 
a promise for the prince Zerubbabel is appended at 
the end. And as far as | can see, in this last sermon 
he does not exhort both the fearful and the languid 
and weary, as it is wont to happen in divine things [ 
that people become sleepy]. The challenge of the 
leader [Serubabel, Cap. 2, 3. ff.) is the first by which 
Satan resists on the left and fights against it, as the 
prophet described such challenges when _ the 
Gentiles fought against the Jews. When 





Cap. 2, 10-13. 1761 
but Satan realizes that he can do nothing on the left, 
so he turns to the right. Where there is sleepiness 


and peace, there follows a laxity of life, the accidia 


[XXXXxx], "that one becomes weary of a thing”. This 
accidia the prophet experienced here. Here they 
were not afraid, here they were all too sure. Thus 
every word of God has its difficulties from both sides, 
for where Satan cannot rage, he makes tired by being 
dull and sleepy. So it is with us. When there is peace 
and no persecution, we become worse through 
unrestraint. Therefore it is necessary that we be 
admonished twice when we are safe. In the past, 
under the pope, people gave what they had, now no 
one lends a hand. This is what happened to this 
people. Since they were safe by the tender of King 
Darius (as reported in Ezra (Cap. 6)), the people 
began to grow weary and slow to work on the temple 
of GOD. Therefore, this sermon fights against the 
people's sluggishness in completing the work of 
GOD. The question which he puts before them of 
your holy flesh, and holds the punishments against 
them, moves me to this view. He would not have 
presented the question of the holy flesh if he was not 
dealing with things that were in good peace. He says: 
If you do not work and hasten the work 1) on my 
house, all that you may do 2c. does not please me. 


Of the ninth moon. 


He preached the earlier sermons in the sixth and 
seventh months. In the eighth, in which Zechariah 
prophesied, he spoke nothing. After that he returns 
here in the ninth month. He was silent for two months, 
during which they worked. After that they became lax 
and neglected the temple because they were working 
on their things. Therefore, he strengthens them by 
another kind of exhortation. 


V. 12. 13. Ask the priests about the law and say: If 
someone carries holy flesh in his garment, and 
touches bread with his garments, 2) Vegetable 2c.

Interpretations on the Prophets.

"In the geren", in a fold or in the outermost corner 
of the garment. "Holy meat" was that which was 
sacrificed, and indeed one part fell to the priest, the 
other to the sacrificer. The garment in which the meat 
is wrapped 2c. can touch anything edible that is not 
sacred. Now it is asked whether it becomes holy by 
touching the garment. The priests answer: No. That 
is one part of the question; the other: 


V. 14 But if an unclean person touches one of the 
carcasses he has touched, would it also be unclean? 


It is a Levitical way of speaking [immundus in 
anima] that is, one who is unclean by touching a dead 


person, 4 Mos. 6, 6. ff. [4 Mos. 19, 11. 13.] In anima, 
that is, by a dead person. It is not his soul that is 
unclean, but he is one who is defiled in another, killed 


or dead. Super animam would be better Latin, or: of 
any dead, killed one. "If he touched this one,” what 
the garment touches would make it unclean‘? It is 
answered, "It would become unclean." This is not by 
nature, because the priests must discern about it; 
neither would] his man become [unclean] if he 
touched an unclean thing, namely, an unclean 
garment, because by nature everything is pure 1) but 
because the law had decreed it so. Here [it is denied] 
that the garment is holy. Everything that an unclean 
woman, an (unclean) man, from whatever 
uncleanness they suffer, touches, that is defiled. 
Nothing pure is where they dwell, even the dwelling 
sist unclean]. 2) On the other hand, if a holy thing has 
touched something [, asks) the prophet: Does the 
same sanctify this? No, for nothing else is sanctified 
except by ashes and by blood; by 


1) According to the Altenburg manuscript, we have assumed 
munaa instead of irnmuiiaa in our original. Similarly, we have made 
additions in the preceding and following, and instead of the first

2) The Erlanger offers: niNil rnuiidi iiki ... contra 2c. The Weimar one 
added thus: niNil rnundi, ubi liakitstis, stiarn baditatio. Instead of 
takitotis we have assumed liabitant. 





these means all things were ordained holy. - The 
sanctified flesh makes nothing holy, because it is not 
written, but the things which are ordained holy. It 
follows that an unclean man [defiles] all things clean 
2c. The question is easy. | leave useless questions 
here, because he speaks here only of the outward 
uncleanness and sanctification according to the 
Levitical law. Why does the prophet use this figure of 
speech? He has nothing else that moved him to it, 
but that he wants to stimulate the slack people to 
work by this question. Therefore he uses new words, 
examples, pictures, motives, as a right preacher 
does, so that he wakes up the sleepy hearts, 
straightens their necks and ears by a strange 
question and a strange task to be solved. From their 
own testimony he decides the people, (directs this) 
against them and applies it so: 


V. 15. 3) Just so are this people and these people 
before me. 


How can this application stand? Everything is 
unclean that is touched by unclean people, and no 
thing is sanctified by touching a holy thing. Such is 
this people before me. Therefore, everything they 
have offered, everything they have touched, is 
unclean in my sight. The other piece he leaves 
standing, as if to say: The temple, the word is holy 
2c., and yet it sanctifies not, because they are 
unclean, and were sure to let their hands rest, as if 
they were clean before me. Now he says: No. 
Because the temple is not yet sanctified, they are 
obligated to the sacrifices and put them off. As long 
as the temple is not yet completed, they cannot offer 
pleasant sacrifices, but everything they offer is 
unclean. Therefore, be lively and hasten with the 
completion. It counts for nothing that holy things are 
there, the vessels, the word, for you are unclean and 
you unclean make everything unclean. The holy 
things that are there are not holy to you, for you are 
not sanctified. Therefore, hurry; if you wait, you will 
not accomplish anything.

1764 L. XXVII, 381-S83. Interpretation of Haggai (2.), cap. 2, 15-18. 


1765 





1) He gathers evidence from everywhere, 
whimsical places, to incite the fallen hearts. Thus 
does the prophet to encourage the weary hearts. The 
temple is a holy thing, and yet you are not holy 
[through it], but rather an unclean man makes the 
holy unclean. Therefore, | am not holy to you 
because you are not holy. You will be holy when you 
make the temple right. It includes at the same time 
the sincerity or purity of faith under legal 
righteousness, because it was not a law that was to 
be built, but a work of faith. Above [v. 6.] it was said, 
"Fear not." Such promises demand faith. They have 
become weary in the way of faith. He punishes this 
defilement of faith with this similitude of legal purity. 
If faith is right, it burns and shines, as Christ says 
Matth. 5, 16.], therefore works and fruits follow; if this 
does not happen, it is the sign of a weak faith. 
Therefore the prophet concludes: "Just as in the law 
of Moses an unclean person makes everything 
unclean by touching it, and is not sanctified by a holy 
thing, so before me the best have become nothing; 
you may appear pure according to the law, but not 
before me. 


And all the work of their hands, and what they offer 
is unclean. 

Not only what they do is unclean, but also what 
they do in the service of God is not pleasing to God, 
because they do not first have enough faith. | 
promised [v. 5] that | would be with them; they 2) do 
not believe it. | want to be satisfied that my words are 
fulfilled in faith. He indicates that they have been 
sleepy in faith. They wanted works of the law, which 
did not please GOtte. Matth. 23, 23: "This one should 
do and that one should not leave" 2c. So by this 
similitude he indicates the same: 


1) Already here, the original has the first words of v. 16 as a 
keyword, as do the editions. The Weimar edition points out in a note 


You do 3) many things. | do not care about this, 
because it is the least thing in the law. This passage 
proves that works do not justify, all that they do does 
not purify; this is a clear text. Why? Because they do 
not believe. If faith is not there first, then works are 
nothing. 


V.16. And now see how you have fared since that 
day and before. 


He repeats the same thing he said above [Cap. 1, 
5. 7.]. He reminds them of their harm. Isaiah says 
[Cap. 28, 19.]: "Challenge teaches to remember the 
word." "Fools must be beaten with pistons." It is a 
proverb: although he understands, he does not know 
how to answer. He wants to open their eyes by 4) 
their harm. Therefore, because you were negligent, 
because the blows do not remind you, because | 
promised and you did not [believe] 2c. So it happens 
with the works, Matt. Il, 17: "We whistled to you and 
you would not dance], we lamented to you" 2c. If it 
were Satan, we would be quick on the draw. 


V. 17: That when one came to the heap of grain, 
which was to have twenty measures, there were 
scarcely ten 2c. 


He remembers this misfortune, this plague. If you 
do not want to be instructed by promises, by blows, 
as unruly servants do, then also be ashamed that you 
are considered servants of the Lord. 


V. 18, For | plague you with drought, grain of fire 2c. 

5) Human nature is  so_ ruthless and 
incomprehensible that it is not improved by plagues, 
but rather moves away from God. Isaiah says [Cap. 
9, 13]: "So the people also do not turn to him who 
smites them", because they never ascribe guilt to 
themselves, because they do not believe that the 
punishment has befallen them because of guilt. The 
more it is beaten

the more deluded it becomes, as today the Jews 
attribute the punishments to something else, not to 
their unbelief. Since the guilt is not recognized, they 
cannot repent. Now they have seen signs, by 
plagues they are not moved. "Grain of fire." These 
plagues are in Moses (Deut. 28, 22.] 1) (in the song): 
"with heat and drought". 


V. 19. Look at it now 2c. (Ponite corda.) 


Ponite he repeats again. Corda is not here [at the 
end of the verse). At the end he repeats only the 
beginning of the speech. Ps. [68, 17.], "GOD delights 
to dwell on this mountain." 2) In so should have been 
omitted. Here the commentators raise a question 
about the month and about the beginning of the 
foundation, and put a twofold, the first and the 
second. | do not want to reject this. But the prophet 
began to speak in the sixth month on the first day. 
After that he returns to preaching on the 24th day (of 
the sixth month) and on the 21st (of the seventh 
month). At that time, on the 24th day, they obeyed 
the prophet and began to work. At that time, he 
indicates, the foundation was laid, although the 
foundation had also been laid before that, since they 
were prevented by Cambyses, the king of the 
Persians. But the prophet says this because they 
returned to his word. And it is believable that they did 
not lay the foundation in truth. There is no question 
about this. He indicates that they began to lay the 
foundation according to the word and in the power of 
God. 3) 


V. 20. (For the seed is still in the barn, and bears 
nothing yet 2c.) 


(Instead of: Nunquid jam) it should be: Nun 


adhuc. He wants to say: "Look at it", whether this is 
not a manifest plague of God fei. 


1) The Weimar edition has ary margin, tempted by the words "im 
Liede": "Deut. 32, 24." 

2) In the Vulgate: Llons, in quo denoplaotum est Oeo Nukiture r-r 
eo. The following remark refers to this. 

3) Here in our template is still: "tzuia?" added to this section. Then 
a new section begins: ,, 20; nun uaUue." We consider that an 
interrogation of the copyist took place. In the Vulgate, v. 20. begins 
with the words: Nunquid jain, to which the words nun nclkue give the 
explanation. 





1767 





The time when the seed should sprout, that the trees 
should appear, because it is the ninth month, is still 
delayed. It is cold, and everything seems to want to 
deny you the fruit because you are sluggish and 
sleepy. He still irritates them with a prophecy: Be 
strong, | will give you blessings. Here another 
question arises, about the beginning of the months, 
because in the ninth month still nothing bursts forth. 
November is (with lins) in January or February, 
because they begin the year with March. What is this 
miracle? This is something natural in all countries; 
why does he cite this to frighten them? According to 
the Scriptures, one assumes a twofold counting of the 
months. The one: the (first) month according to the 
law and nature, which seems to agree with nature, as 
2 Mos. 12, 2. is written, is March or April, because it 
is brought forth from the earth; everything is in seed. 
The other: afterwards they say the beginning of the 
months is September, at the end of the year. When 
there is the end, they start anew another beginning. 
Thus we would find the ninth month in April and May. 
Gladly | agree with these, because | have nothing 
else to say. In November it is not a miracle, but if it is 
in April or May, then it is a miracle and a sign, if there 
is only cold or dryness. At the end one more thing is 
added, which concerns a peculiar promise to 
Zerubbabel. In the same month, on the same day, 
there was a special sermon and comfort to the leader 
of the people, because (God seems to have loved 
him) as a good (man] 4), since the Lord glorifies him. 


V. 22. 5) | will move heaven and earth. 


This he proclaims to the leader not only for his own 
comfort, but also for the comfort of the people, as 
above. It is the change of all things through the word, 
first in the heart, then with violence and impetuosity. 
So today the popes rise higher only to fall lower. They 
seek a deeper fall, which will also be theirs.

These are exceedingly kind words: [You] "shall be

[Cap. 22, 24.] "| have chosen thee." This is not 
spoken to his person alone; this is done for Christ's

He addresses this to the person who was godly in the

P, Interpretations on the prophet Zechariah. 


1, the prophet Zechariah, interpreted by Martin Luther. *) 


Published by Luther himself in German at the end of December 1527. 


Preface. 


1. God, the Almighty Father, has given us at this 
time many excellent, learned people, who act 
mightily on the Holy Scriptures, both in the New and 
Old Testaments. May He also help us and give us 


(2) In addition, there are more and more reckless 
spirits every day who know no end to their art, 
although, as St. Paul says [1 Tim. 6:3, 4], they do not 
yet know how they should know. These are the ones 


who ride high, on top and nowhere, just as if they had 
the ge- 


grace to recognize it and give thanks, amen. 


*) After Luther, probably already in 1525 and in the first months of 1526, had given lectures on Zechariah, he started at the beginning 
of 1527 to interpret and publish this prophet in German. Already on January 1, 1527, he wrote to Michael Stiefel that he was busy editing 
Zechariah (St. Louis edition, vol. XIX, 1792 we have assigned this letter with Seidemann and Burkhardt to the year 1528, but it is more 
correctly placed with Késtlin, vol. Il, 644 aa 1132) in the year 1527). On January 10, 1527, it was already being worked on in the print shop, 
as we see from Luther's letter to Nicolaus Hausmann (De Wette Ill, 154). But on September 2, the interpretation was only half finished, as 
Luther writes to Viscampius (De Wette III, 199); the cause of this delay was Luther's state of health. On December 28, 1527, Luther sent a 
finished copy to Spalatin (De Wette III, 248). Since it was customary in the Reformation period to begin the new year with Christmas Day, 
the Jena edition correctly placed our writing in the year 1528, as was done in the only original edition, which bears the title: "Der Prophet 
Sachar Ja, ausgelegt durch Mart. Luther." At the end: "Printed at Wittemberg. Michel Lotter. M.D.XXVIII." The other editions are reprints 
bearing the same title; one appeared in the same year at Erfurt "ynn der Archen Noe durch Melchior Sachssen"; another in 1528 without 
indication of the place; a third without place and time. In the collective editions: in the Wittenberg (1556), vol. V, p. 366; in the Jena (1552), 
vol. IV, p. 233; in the Altenburg, vol. IV, p. 276; in the Leipzig, vol. VIII, p. 525 and in the Erlangen, vol. 42, p. 108. Our writing is translated 
into Latin by M. Laurentius Span and included in the Latin Wittenberg edition (1566), born. V, col. 505. We give the text according to the 
Erlangen edition, which offers the same according to the original. 


1770 Erl. 42, 110-112. interpretations on the prophets. 


My doctrine of faith, love and the cross has long since 
been torn by the shoes; they fall for figures, secret 
interpretations and allegories, and tickle themselves 
with fine thoughts, so that they likewise lick and jump. 
As Origen and Jerome did in ancient times, who 
made the world full of allegories, and yet waved them 
to the common useful doctrine; so that the 
blasphemer Porphyrio was given honest causes to 
mock the Christians, as if their doctrine was such a 
vain work of interpretation. 

(3) So now, too, each one wants to be a new 
master of deception. This one takes Daniel, that one 
Apocalypse, and so on, either what is most difficult, 
or what has the most allegories; there they want to 
prove their art, but pay no attention at all to how 
useful they are to your poor common man, but how 
artistically and splendidly they can teach, and are, 
praise God, now all highly learned doctors who need 
nothing from us. And even if they interpret as long 
and as much, they still have nothing certain on which 
to build. 

4 Now this would be a good thing for them to 
suffer, if they did the same with themselves or with 
the scholars, and also gave the unlearned people 
their share, that is, the simple teaching of the faith of 
Christ. For | daily find that there are very few 
preachers nowadays who can understand and teach 
the Lord's Prayer, the faith, and the Ten 
Commandments properly and well to the poor 
people. And while they fly high in Daniel, Hosea, 
Apocalypsi and such heavy books, the poor rabble 
goes and listens, and gapes at such splendid 
jugglers, with great wonder. When the year is over, 
they can neither read the Lord's Prayer, nor the Faith, 
nor the Ten Commandments, which are the most 
noble pieces, as the old, right, Christian catechism, 
or common instruction for Christians. | do not know 
how much more useful such launderers are to the 
poor people than those who preached Aristotle and 
spiritual law before. 


W. VI, 3293-3296. 1771 

They open their mouths to this witty rabble, just as if 
it were asmall thing that has been revealed to us, how 
we have been redeemed and saved from sins and 
death through Christ; that we know how to keep God's 
commandments, and how to bear the cross and 
persecution 2c. No, such is not'ts, they can fine; yes, 
like the goose the Psalter. | have myself (I say this 
truly) had before me ten such high prophets, who 
always wanted to teach me high things and the most 
spiritual spirit; and when | did not want to accept it, but 
wanted to stay with the bad crucified, simple Christ, 
they became angry, went away, and created hordes. 

(6) Wherefore | beseech and exhort every man, 
both teachers and disciples, with all Christian 
faithfulness: first, that they despise not them which 
interpret the scriptures, and are able to do and give 
the hard books: for Paul saith [1 Thess. 5:19, 20.Paul 
says [1 Thess. 5:19, 20] that one should not despise 
diviners, nor dampen spirits (only that they do so in 
places and before persons where it is useful and 
necessary; as Paul teaches the Colossians [Col. 4:6] 
that their speech should be useful where it is 
necessary); but do not greatly esteem interpreters, 
who base all their art on allegories, which, of course, 
do not seek much benefit but great fame. For without 
such art one can well be a Christian and be blessed, 
because they interpret nothing, or even rarely 
something certain. 

(7) The best and most useful teachers, however, 
and the best of all, are those who can teach the 
catechism well; that is, the Lord's Prayer, the ten 
commandments, and teaching the faith correctly, 
these are strange birds. For there is neither great 
glory nor appearance in such, but still great benefit, 
and is also the most necessary sermon, because 
therein is briefly comprehended the whole Scripture, 
and there is no gospel in which one could not teach 
such, if only one would do it, and take care to teach 
the common poor man. One must always preach such 
a short thing to the rabble, as the Lord's Prayer, the

For this reason | have also read this prophet 
Zechariah, and now let it go forth; truly, not for the 
common people, but for those who like to read the 
Scriptures at home and want to strengthen 
themselves in the faith, but mostly for the sake of the 
careless spirits who fall into the allegories, and also 
lack mastery. For since this prophet has many 
visions, and much interpretation is needed, | have 
wanted to help forestall the same spirits, and to 
show, as much as is in me, that it is not so great an 
art to give allegories and interpretations, as they 
boast and wonder, but that one should seek the right 
principal, faith, always and in all prophets. Which, 
alas, they do very little of, and jump about as if it were 
an unnecessary thing. 





9. but Christ our Lord give us all his Spirit and 
gifts, not for our glory, but for the benefit and 
improvement of Christianity, for which alone the 
Spirit is given; as St. Paul says 1 Cor. 12:11, that it 
may be equally and rightly distributed, namely, to us 
shame and = dishonor for our sin and 
unrighteousness, but to the Lord praise and honor, 
love and thanksgiving for his unspeakable grace and 
gifts forever. Amen. 1) 


1) After this preface, in the Wittenberg edition, both the German 
and the Latin, the preface is inserted, which is found Walch, St. Louis 
edition, in the 14th volume, Col. 66 ff. In the original, the translation 
of the entire prophet follows, which we, like Walch, have omitted. 





The first chapter. 


(1) In the prophet Habakkuk (preface § 5. 6) we 

heard how the ministry and preaching of the old 
prophets had been of the two things: The first, that 
they kept the people in discipline and prepared them 
for the future kingdom of Messiah, as St. Paul says in 
Gal. 24: "The law has been our schoolmaster for the 
future Christ. For as a young son, though he be heir 
and lord of all his father's goods, yet the same are not 
left in his hands, till he be grown up first, and be well 
brought up; and must first suffer the taskmaster, 
before he become the captain of the house. 
2. the other part, that they prophesy and praise of the 
same kingdom of Christ, under which they exhort the 
people to suffer the disciplinarian patiently for a time, 
and also comfort them that they should not despair of 
it, though it may seem as if it would not come, 
because they were so_ afflicted, oppressed, 
imprisoned, and led away by the Gentiles. Just as a 
young heir is admonished to be pious, to study 
diligently and to obey the disciplinarian, for it will not 
be long before he will be rich and a great lord; for this 
he should suffer gladly, whether the father of the ruth 
needs and sometimes punishes him, and not during 
the time of the punishment. 





He will not think that his father will leave him or expel 
him from the house because of this, but will suffer 
such seriousness, anger and sour looks as a pious 
child until he grows up. 

3. while they practice such two things with 
preaching, they sometimes do a miraculous work, or 
show a comforting vision of God, to confirm such 
teaching among the people. Just as a father 
sometimes buys and sends or brings to his son and 
heir, besides the rod and disciplinarian, a red pair of 
shoes or bag, or otherwise a fair, so that the boy does 
not hate the rod too much and become an enemy of 
the father, but suffers the sharp rod in patience and 
always keeps the love for the father in his heart, both 
over rod and disciplinarian. In short, as a pious, wise 
father raises up his child, so God also dealt with this 
people, and still deals with us in this way, when he 
makes us suffer much according to the flesh, and 
keeps sharp rods and disciplinarians over us; and yet 
comforts us with the promise of the future glorious joy 
and blessedness in heaven. 

4 Now this prophet Zechariah is in these pieces, 
especially in the other piece, a paragon, and in my 
opinion the most distinguished. 


1774 Erl. 4L, 131-133. interpretations on the prophets. 


W. VI, 3300-3303. 1775 





For he was also at the time when it was most 
necessary to comfort the people with the future 
kingdom of Christ and to keep them under discipline, 
because the people, neither before nor after, was 
never so scattered, chased away, 1) and scattered, 
as long as it was called God's people, as at this time 
of the Babylonian prison. For the people of Israel 
were like a flock of sheep when the wolf came among 
them in the absence of the shepherd; several of them 
were strangled, but those that got out and escaped 
were so confused and frightened that it was very 
difficult to bring them back to the fold; Or, if a marten 
comes among the chickens at night, there is also 
such a choking, spraying and lamentation that the 
remaining chickens also become so timid and stupid 
that they do not know where to go, and one must also 
drive very carefully that one can lure them together 
again. 

(5) Of course, the Jewish people were also 
troubled when they were recently disturbed by the 
Babylonians, because wherever they thought to go or 
whatever they planned to do, they always thought the 
land would be full of Babylonians. Therefore it costs 
the prophet much enticement and many good sweet 
words before he brings them together again and 
strengthens them. To us, who have not been in the 
bath, such words move us nothing, but seem to us 
vain, and henceforth to be impotent words. But they 
hold up to us an excellent example of faith, which we 
would never have had if we had been among the 
Jews at that time, as we shall see hereafter. 


In the eighth month of the second year of Darius the 
king, the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah the 
son of Berechiah the son of Jeddo the prophet, saying, 
The LORD was wroth with your fathers. 


6 To understand this text, we have to touch a little 
the ancient histories. In the first book of Ezra [Cap. 1, 
3] we read how Cyrus, the first king in Persia, in his 
first year allowed the Jews to be free and to go to 
Jerusalem and to build it again, as it was announced 
before by the prophet Jeremiah [Cap. 29, 10]. So in 
the same year 


1) In the original: verjeucht. 





The foundation was laid and started in the first years. 
While Cyrus went to Scythia to fight against the 
queen Thamyris, 2) he left Darius Histaspis in the 
country, who was king with him, and helped him to 
win Babylon and the Chaldean Empire. But Darius 
died the next year, and Cyrus fought for twenty years, 
until the queen slew him and threw his head into a 
barrel full of human blood, saying: "Drink the blood 
that you have always thirsted for. Because Darius 
was dead, and Cyrus in the fight was not home, the 
officials in Judea went to the Jews and refused to let 
them build [Ezra 4, 4. 5, 6. ff.], so that nothing was 
built for the twenty years of Cyrus, and they were 
treated as poor, miserable people are treated by 
tyrants, as Zechariah afterwards confesses Cap. 8, 
10: There was no peace 2c. And no one could do 
anything about it, so badly did God start it through 
King Cyrus. 

7th After the death of Cyrus, Arthasastha, read in 
Ezra, who is otherwise called Artaxerxes or 
Cambyses, and Ahasuerus Priscus, who became 
captain of Holofernes, were strangled by the Jews at 
Bethulia by Judith [Judith 13:9] (is the same story 
true). Therefore he was angry, and the Jews were 
also otherwise accused against him by the 
governors, Ezra 4, 7. ff., that he also forbade to build 
the temple; this also lasted twenty years, as long as 
he reigned. Behold, so long were the Jews deceived 
and hindered; should they not have despaired and 
grown weary of believing, since in forty-two years 
they held no happiness but vain hindrance? 
Therefore the prophets had to present many words 
and signs to comfort them and to keep them in faith 
in such a manifold accident. 

8th After this came the third king Darius 
Longimanus, of whom Zechariah and Haggai speak, 
in which year, by his command, the temple was built, 
Ezra 6:1 ff. Then these prophets stood up and 
stopped. Therefore the Jews say John 2:20 that the 
temple was built in forty-six years, and Christ would 
build it in three days; that is, in six days. 


2) This is how her name is written in all editions. 


1776 Erl. 42, 133-135. interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 1, 1-3. 


W. VI, 3303-3306. 1777 





Forty years and forty years were passed by before it 
was built, through many great obstacles. As Daniel 


Cap. 9, 25 had said before: In angustia temporum, 
that is, it would be built with hardship and sorrow. 

009 From all these things we know the time of the 
prophet Zechariah, which was about the forty and 
fifth year after they were delivered from Babylon, and 
he began to preach two months after Haggai. For 
Haggai began in the sixth month of the other year 
Darii. Now this is that he says here: he began in the 
other year Darii of the eighth moon. The Hebrew 
language calls this king Dariaves, like the king Cyrus 
Cores. 

010 And he begins his first sermon with the word, 
"The Lord was angry with your fathers," that is, with 
admonition of wrath and punishment for the past sin 
of their fathers. And this whole first sermon remains 
on the same opinion, that he may move them by the 
present punishment of the former disobedience, to 
be the more pious and obedient, just as one points 
out the rod to a child, so that he is first strengthened 
to be more pious. As if to say, "You see how angry 
the Lord was with your fathers, and how severely he 
punished their disobedience. Take heed to 
yourselves, and beware lest ye do likewise. For now 
we also come to you with God's word and command 
that you should be godly and build the temple. If you 
also disobey, the rod and punishment will not stay 
with you long, as follows in the text, and the prophet 
himself further emphasizes such preaching. 


v. 3 And saith unto them, Thus saith the LORD of 

hosts; Return unto me, saith the LORD of hosts; and | 
will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. 
011 Then before he brings upon them the 
disobedience of their fathers, and reproaches them 
with the punishment and wrath of God, he calls 
before them, and preaches to them that they should 
be godly, saying, "Turn ye unto me," that is, send 
yourselves to be my people, to serve me only, and to 
obey my commandments, "and | will turn again unto 
you," that | may be your God; and 





again do all good, and defend you before all the 
world, as | was before | turned away from you, when 
your fathers were still pious, and had not turned away 
from me. One turning brings another. Just as your 
fathers turned away from me, so | also turned away 
from them. Now therefore ye turn again unto me, and 
| will turn again unto you. 

(12) | say this because the school-baiters and 
sophists use this saying for free will, as if man could 
convert himself, because God says here: "Turn to 
me," although the text does not say here what man is 
able to do, but what he is obliged to do. For when he 
says, "Return to me," he indicates that they should 
turn back, that is, keep all the commandments and 
be pious. Now whether a man may do this of himself, 
the Scripture does not say here, but elsewhere 
sufficiently. It is quite far from each other, to be able 
to do and to do ought; therefore one does not have 
to lead the scripture nor understand of being able to 
do, since it speaks of doing ought; of which | wrote 


further in my booklet Servum arbitrium 1). 

(13) Then let us see why the prophet, who is 
supposed to comfort the poor, frightened multitude, 
is at first even more frightened, and begins with 
sorrow, and shows the rod. But it is the way of the 
Holy Spirit that he first begins sharp and hard, and 
then becomes kind and sweet. Again, the devil enters 
gently, and starts sweetly, but afterwards he leaves 
his stink behind, and goes out sourly. Just as a father 
first chastises his child harshly and sharply, but after 
that it is the dear child, and sweet love is present. 

14 So also here, because this prophet wants to 
give much comfort, he starts hard and serious, and is 
not only the spirit's way and manner, but the adversity 
demands it from us. For, as has been said, this poor 
people had had many hindrances, longer than forty 
years, from their neighbors and from the emperor in 
Persia, and they were also in trouble, as Haggai says 
[Cap. 2, 18], that such great causes (as always rise 
up against God's word and work)

because he is examining the prophets and teachers, so 
that one may understand how their fathers' sin was most 
of all, that they did not believe or trust in God in their 
temptation, but sought help from men, and thus became 
apostate, idolatrous people, and that the word "turn to 
me" goes deep and searches the heart; namely, that one 
then turns to God when one defies and trusts in God in 
all matters, needs and concerns; again, then turns away 
when one does not trust in God. Then no sacrifice nor 
good work will help, in which their fathers, together with 
their prophets, were very skilled. So also now, in this 
case, to build the temple, since there are many 
temptations, it is necessary to turn to the Lord of hosts, 
to cling to him, and to rely on him, be it the emperor in 
Persia or the neighbors. God speaks; he will, will and 
can also help; so that they will not fall to the Gentiles 
again. 

(20) Such and such admonitions are always 
necessary for us against the mobs and tyrants, so that 
we do not fall away for their sake. For we also see how 
the Romans and all tyrants have fared. For where are 
they now? So also the Arians and all heretics, where are 
they now? And the princes and the mobs that are raging 
now will be the same in a little while. Therefore, let every 
one turn and hold to Christ, and do not fall away; let no 
one be deterred or deceived. God speaks, God will also 
do it. 


V. 6. Is it not so, that my words and my judgments, 
which | commanded by my servants the prophets, 
have grieved your fathers? that they have turned back, 
saying, As the LORD of hosts commanded us to do, 
and as we went and did, so hath he done unto us. 

21 That is, my prophets and | had to be wrong at that 
time; what they said was nothing; the false prophets had 
to be right, they followed them. But how did it end? My 
word remained, and as | said, so it came to pass, and 
not as the false prophets. Let this be a warning to you, 
and take hold of the experience you see, that all their 
teaching and hope is so utterly lost, that in the end they 
will be punished. 





They themselves had to confess that it was not as their 
prophets had said, but as | had spoken. But it did not 
help at that time; now that it has come upon them, they 
believe and feel it. Beware yourselves also. 

22 O, who will give that even now our tyrants and 
mobs believe God's words? Nothing will come of it; they 
want it and must learn it, so that they may hear this 
sermon at last, and confess that it was true; and yet they 
say that they did not believe that it would be so. Summa, 
one does not believe God until one hears it; so it has 
lasted too long. 

23 Therefore this is the sum of this first preaching of 
Zechariah, that he will first make the people devout and 
godly with prophecies and promises, introducing the 
example of their fathers to terrify them. For because they 
are to build the temple and the city of Jerusalem, and to 
do such a good work, he wants them to be devout 
beforehand, so that they will not think that God is 
satisfied with the work of building the temple and the city, 
just as their forefathers thought it was enough for them 
to sacrifice. No, dear man, he wants to have faith and a 
converted heart before all good works; that is all that 
matters to him; this must precede, and must be 
preached first: "Return to me"; then build the temple for 
me. And not thus, First build ye the temple, and 
afterward return ye unto me. Good works puff up and 
make proud, but faith and heart conversion humble and 
make us despondent in ourselves. 

For this very reason they were prevented from 
building the temple for more than forty years, even 
though there was not one obstacle, but much 
encouragement, to believe and to be pious, patient and 
holy, namely, so many temptations and persecutions 
that they had to experience that being pious and 
believing was more and far more important than building 
temples and houses and making sacrifices to God. As 
also Hosea 6, 6. says: | like good deeds more than 
sacrifices 2c. 

25 Thus God always teaches faith and right piety first, 
then outward works. But men, as having come far above 
faith and godliness, teach before 


1782 Erl. 42, 140-143. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3311-3344. 


1783 





and above all things vain outward works, as if it were 
because of them. But God indicates here that He will not 
look at the temple unless they are first converted and 
pious, even if the temple is pure gold, ruby, emerald and 
diamond. 


In the fourth and twentieth day of the eleventh 
month, which is the moon of Zebat, in the second year 
of Tarn the king, came the word of the LORD unto 
Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Jddo the 
prophet, saying. 


(26) The Jews count not the moons by the calendar, as 
we do, but by the moon's course in the heavens: neither 
do they reckon the year, as we do. For with them the first 
moon and the beginning of the year is April, that is, when 
April becomes new, when spring comes and all things 
become new. Although according to the course of the 
moon April is often in the sky, when it is still March in the 
calendar. So it goes also with all other moons that the 
eleventh moon with the Jews is the hornung, and may 
well be that still in Jenner is according to the calendar 
and with us, when the hornung is new with the Jews. So 
Zechariah began this first sermon in the eighth moon, 
that is, in the winter moon, almost around the grape 
harvest (according to the calendar in the grape moon), 
that they should become devout; and this other sermon, 
where he comforts them to build, was given around our 
women's Candlemas Day, when spring breaks, and time 
wants to work and build. 

27 After the first sermon follows the other, in which he 
begins to comfort them to build, for he has no doubt 
preached the first sermon more than once for the past 
three months, and has also continued to cut out the 
words and explain with examples how to preach. 

28 In the other sermon he shows a comforting vision, 
like a man riding a red horse among the myrtles, with 
many elders coming to him and proclaiming to him that 
all countries sit still. For the prophet saw such visions, 
that he should preach them unto the people for comfort 
and exhortation. And this is the summa and opinion of 
this vision, that the people should not be afraid, neither 
before [thej emperor in Persia, 





nor before their neighbors, but be sure and confident that 
no one will hinder them from building henceforth, as they 
have been hindered hitherto; for there is neither war nor 
strife anywhere, but all countries sit quietly, and peace is 
everywhere, and now they build well. But it was difficult 
for the people to believe this, because they had 
experienced much else during the forty years. Therefore, 
the prophet had to strengthen their hearts with words and 
visions and assure them that God was now merciful. 
(29) In fact, all the circumstances of the face, both in 
gestures and words, indicate that there is peace and 
silence. The first, that the angels appear and speak with 
men. For where it is of wrath, 1) the angels leave us, and 
hide themselves, that they be neither seen nor heard. 
(30) Secondly, that the angels with the horses do not 
keep in order or in battle, 2) nor do they carry shields or 
armor, but in a merry meadow or arboretum, where they 
do not quarrel, but sing, leap, and be merry, as when 
there is peace in the land. 

The third, that the angel holds among the myrtles. Myrtus 
is not in German lands, nor have | seen any elsewhere. 
But they write that it is not a wild tree, but a tame one, 
like pear and apple trees. It is green in winter and 
summer, like firs, spruces and box trees, and bears 
berries that are used to make must and oil, and also 
tastes vinous, has narrow and many leaves, but is not 
nutritious. 3) It is also used to make short spears, just as 
hornbeam is used to make pork spears in our country, 
because it is not a tall tree. The Romans used it for 
wreaths when they were triumphant, and also in 
reconciliations. Now because the angel holds under the 
tame trees, it is a sign that there is peace; just as if we 
saw horsemen holding under the lime tree, it would be a 
sign of peace. For under the linden tree we are wont to 
drink, dance and be merry, not

nor serious, 1) because the lime tree is a tree of peace 
and joy in our country. 

The fourth, that the angels go forth with words, and 
freely confess that there is peace everywhere. We have 
gone, they say, through all the countries, and behold, all 
the countries are at rest; that is, you must fear no one. 
There is neither strife nor strife against you anywhere. 

(33) But the stupid mind does not believe this yet, and 
always worries about the contradiction; because it has 
been hit on the mouth before, it fears that there will be 
more blows behind. The same was true of the Jews, who 
had been rolled and bruised before, but were always 
afraid that there would be more. Therefore this face also 
appears outwardly, just as they are inwardly minded. 
Although it is comforting and peaceful, reason does not 
see and accept it that way. Therefore the prophet himself 
starts and says with fear: "Lord, who are these? As if to 
say, Woe is me, there are horses and horsemen, what 
does this mean? What do they want to do? Is there still 
no peace, but always war and strife? 

For God always does this when He begins to comfort, so 
that it seems terrible. So Mary, the virgin, was also 
frightened when the angel Gabriel brought her the most 
joyful message [Luc. 1, 29], and the shepherds in the 
field were also frightened at first by the clarity of the angel 
[Cap. 2, 9/, and the disciples when they saw Christ 
walking on the sea [Marc. 6, 49. 51.]. 

(35) So Zechariah is shocked for his own and his 
people's sake that he sees horses and horsemen. For 
horses are war animals, as Solomon says in Proverbs 
[Cap. 21, 31.] and Job 39, 21. ff. Item, that he sees them 
in the meadow, in the ground, as on a cunning, yearly 
ambush; in addition in the night, since it is otherwise in 
itself yearly and frightening, more than in the day, with it 
is indicated, how their heart was fearful and timid. For as 
the hearts stand, so also the visions and revelations go. 
Therefore the angel comforted him, or the man who 
stood among the myrtles (for Zechariah puts both). 


1) Dietz explains "ernsten" by: to argue, to fight. The Latin translator 
offers: tumultuAri. 


W. VI, 3314-3316. 1785 


as if to say, "It is true that you see horses, and they are 
red, brown and white; that is, the kings and princes are 
still here and reigning. But do not be afraid, we sit on 
them and keep them in peace, in beautiful meadows, 
under the myrtles, and do not see any armor on us; they 
will not harm you and your people, but rather serve and 
help. 

36 Here we shall now say about horses and angels. The 
first are red, the others brown, which Virgilius 2) calls 


spadices, which are chestnut-brown, very good kind and 
strong horses; the third white. By the horses we 
understand all the rulers who were at that time, 
especially around the Jews. Although some understand 
by the red ones the Babylonians, by the brown ones the 
Assyrians; by the white ones the Persians. But, as | have 
said, because the angels prophesy that all the countries 
through which they passed are silent, we must leave it at 
that, that it means all the kingdoms and dominions that 
were around them, especially the empire that was at that 
time, of which they were afraid. 

37) But the color, that the first is red, 3) the other brown, 
the last white, | respect, means, as it is said, that the 
revelation happens, as those are minded, to whom it 
happens. Now the people always had in mind the killing 
and capturing that they had experienced so far, and they 
were always afraid of it. That is why the first color is red, 
and blood scar. But because there was comfort, the 
other color behind the red is brown, as a sign that the 
fear should soon be relieved, and come from fear to 
security, which security now means the last, white color, 
which is a happy color, like the light. 

Now this text in Zechariah is one of the sayings from 
which one learns how God governs the world through the 
angels, yet He does everything by Himself alone. For 
God has established four kinds of rule. 

39 One that he does for himself, without the cooperation 
of the creatures. This is entirely by his power alone; as 
when he creates and increases the creatures, sustains 
them, and gives them various powers and kinds; to this 
end, he helps them.

him no one. The other is when he commands such 
created and preserved creatures to the angels, that they 
lead, guide, keep, guard and help them from the outside, 
and especially the people; because from the inside only 
the one God receives and helps. Although the dear 
angels do not help from within, as God does, they still do 
their part from without, by giving people good, useful or 
necessary thoughts, and preventing or removing evil, 
harmful thoughts, so that they help to preserve and 
improve people and creatures externally, which God 
Himself does internally alone. 

40 Thus it happens and happens that many a man 
escapes fire, water, murderers, and other accidents, in 
order to do a light thing that moves him, and such a 
thought or other thing occurs to him 1) suddenly, so that 
he is saved, which he could never have thought of 
before, and must say: Well, if | had done this and that, | 
would certainly have drowned, burned, murdered, or 
otherwise perished or suffered harm. Just as it is said, 
"You had a good angel there. That is why the pagans 
attributed this to luck and made an idol out of it. For they 
saw and learned that such a thing happened, but did not 
know that the true God did it through his holy angels. 
Thus it happened to St. Augustine, when the heretics 
held out for him to be killed, that he went down another 
street without a second thought, no doubt by the motion 
of his angels. Item, when the emperor Julius jumped out 
of the ship, and escaped his enemies by swimming, and 
yet was courageous and confident to do so; which 
counsel and courage his angel gave him from without, 
and God from within. It is the same with all people who 
escape misfortune or have good fortune. It is all God's 
work and the work of angels. 

41: So we see here that the angel cares for the Jews 
and asks; item, Zechariah instructs and comforts from 
outside; item, in Daniel Gabriel has much to do with 
teaching, comforting and instructing [Dan. 8, 15-20. 9, 
21.], and shows inside, how the angels of the Jews 


1) "a" is missing in the original edition, but is added in the 
Wittenberg at this place, in the Jena before: "such thought". 





Michael fights for them and how the angel of the empire 
in Persia resists him [Cap. 10, 13]. Such and such a 
revelation of the angels shows how they do so with us 
without ceasing, invisibly and secretly, that their office is 
to help and advise men, to promote and improve, also 
to ask and care for us. 

Thus every emperor, king, prince, lord, even every 
man has his angel, whether the emperor or his empire, 
Christian or not. For it is an outward office which they 
both exercise on the pious and the wicked, because 
both the pious and the wicked are creatures of God, 
created by him. For this reason, he also nourishes, 
sustains, provides for and protects and increases them, 
as a god and master of his work. Where else would the 
Romans often have had such fine coincidences, advice 
and wit? Whence should Hannibal have been so skilful 
and ready and brave? Whence should the great 
Alexander have been so fresh and sprightly, so bold and 
blissful? It is all God's and the angels' work, what they 
have or do useful or blissful. 

The third rule is that God rules through men, as 
through the apostles and preachers. For although God 
could teach people the gospel without preaching, as He 
does inwardly (just as He sustains and governs all 
creatures inwardly without angels), He does not want to 
do it, but needs preachers outwardly through the word, 
and lets them cooperate in the teaching and spirit that 
He Himself gives inwardly. Thus St. Paul boasts in 1 
Cor. 3, 9 that the preachers are God's helpers and co- 
workers in the salvation of the Corinthians; and 2 Cor. 6, 
1 says: We help and admonish you 2c. So also through 
the angels, as co-workers and His helpers, He helps and 
saves all men, and will not teach without the preachers, 
nor help without the angels. For this reason, God wants 
to honor the ministry of preaching and all the authorities, 
because they are His work, and the work of His angels 
and His messengers. 

44 The fourth is the worldly rule, which includes the 
rule of the home and the parents' authority over the 
children. For even though God could raise children 
without parents (as he well demonstrated with Adam 
and Heva, and 


1788 Erl. 42, 147-149. 


Interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 1, 7-11. 


W. VI, 3319-3322. 1789 





He does not want to do it, but has established the order] makes no one pious, only punishes the wicked and fends 


that he does it through the parents and with the parents. 
So he could also keep house without housekeepers, as 
he often does; but still he will not do it, but with the 
housekeepers and through the housekeepers he will do 
it, as the 127th Psalm, v. 1, says: "Where the Lord does 
not build the house, there is no use working to build it. 
So he could well keep peace, punish the wicked, protect 
the pious without sword and prince. But he does not want 
to do this, but has arranged it so that the princes should 
help him, that is, he wants to do this with them and 
through them. Therefore, all regiments are his and truly 
divine regiments, without the need of angels and men, 
so that he may demonstrate his wonderful power, 
wisdom and goodness. 

So he has three kinds of external regiments, and three 
kinds of external ways or means, over his own divine 
regiment. In the temporal regiment is the sword and the 
fist. In the spiritual is the word and the mouth. In the 
angelic one is the. Mind and reason. These are the three 
sages, sword, word, understanding. By the sword | 
understand everything that belongs to the worldly 
regiment, as, worldly rights and laws, manners and 
customs, gestures, estates, differentiated offices, 
person, clothes 2c. By the word everything that belongs 
to the spiritual government, as the spiritual offices, 1 Cor. 
12, 5. Eph. 4, 11. Rom. 12, 7. 8. and the sacraments and 
the like. Through the mind all that the dear angels need, 
that they may move and hinder us from evil, or promote 
us to good. For they do not rule with the sword nor with 
the word, though they can. Again, the spiritual cannot 
rule with the mind, as the angels do; so they do not rule 
with the sword, though they can do it, but with the word. 
The worldly cannot rule with understanding, like the 
angels, nor with the word, like the clergy, but they rule 
with the sword. So each has its own modest work and 
measure, that the lowest cannot govern the highest, but 
the highest can govern the lowest, and that the worldly 
regiment is the lowest and least of God's regiments, for 
it is the lowest and least of all. 


off the disorderly. Enough of that elsewhere. 

(46) And of these three regiments none is contrary to 
the other, neither breaketh nor destroyeth the other; but 
one serveth the other. The lowest, the regiment of the 
sword, serves the gospel by keeping peace among the 
people, without which one could not preach. Again, the 
gospel serves the sword in that it teaches and holds the 
people to the obedience of the sword, and testifies that 
the sword is God's order and regiment [Rom. 13, 4.], 
therefore it is to be feared and honored, without which 
fear and honor the sword would be a wretched, 
miserable regiment. So also the angels serve both the 
gospel and the sword, that they help it and move the 
people with understanding to it. Again, sword and word 
serve the angels. For they make room, and prepare the 
people by peace and preaching, so that the angels can 
come the more strongly to it, and drive their regiment. 
For in strife and in error the angels cannot rule well with 
their understanding. 

Now Satan, whose office is nothing other than to 
break and destroy everything that God creates and does 
through these regiments, rages against such regiments 
of God. First of all, he sets himself against the divine 
regiment, and strangles, breaks, corrupts everything that 
God creates, maintains and improves, as much as God 
decrees for him. For he is the prince of the world [John 
16:11], even a god [2 Corinthians 4:4]. Against the 
angelic government he also has his angels, who instruct, 
counsel and incite the princes, lords and all men to all 
kinds of evil, also directing all obstacles to good and all 
encouragement to evil, inciting people together, setting 
fires here and there where they can, and making the 
world full of sorrow and heartache. Against the spiritual 
regime he has heretics, false teachers, hypocrites, false 
brothers. He will not celebrate until he destroys them. 
Against the secular he has rebellious, disobedient boys, 
evil, poisonous counselors at courts, flatterers, traitors, 
spies, tyrants, rabid people, and everything that serves 
for war, strife and destruction of the country and people. 
That is enough of it now.

Interpretations on the Prophets. 


W. VI, 3322-3324. 1791 





From this, everyone may think how God rules the 
world so strangely, and how he can punish us so easily 
when we sin, that he only removes his hand and lets the 
devil rule, so it is horrible enough in all the world. 


And the angel of the LORD answered and said, 0 
LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on 
Jerusalem, and on the cities of Judah, against which 
thou hast been wroth these seventy years? 


(49) This prayer also the angel must make, that the 
prophet may hear, and declare unto the people, and 
comfort them. And this is a fine prayer. First of all, it is 
done by the Jews' own special angel, who is St. Michael, 
Dan. 12, 1, who takes care of his people with such 
earnestness. In addition, he is considered so great and 
powerful by the others that they come to him and answer 
him and proclaim how all the nations sit still, so that the 
stupid people may be comforted because they hear that 
such a powerful angel cares for them and prays so 
earnestly for them. 

50 Secondly, he makes the prayer hot and fierce, 
indicating the two things, as that all countries sit still, 
without God's own country alone having fear and 
anxiety; and that God had promised to release these 
prisons for seventy years; as Jeremiah chap. 25, 11. and 
Cap. 29, 10. had proclaimed. As if to say, O LORD of 
hosts, have mercy on all other ungodly kings and 
countries, that they sit in peace, but your own people 
alone must have strife; so that it would be better for them 
to have strife, and for your people to have peace. 
Moreover, you promised that after seventy years you 
would turn away your wrath. Because thou art righteous 
in thy works, and true in thy words, consider thyself, and 
remember thy righteousness and thy truth; for thou wilt 
not consider them. 

(51) Behold, how accurately and honestly the angel 
speaks to God. 1) These are the right prayers, which 
take hold of God, and penetrate with 


1) The Wittenberg edition and Walch have changed "GOtte" to 
"GOttes". The 'Latin translation offers:

His righteousness and truth, and not alone with our 
needs and concerns. Where does he want to go? What 
does he want to do? His own righteousness and truth 
pleads, compels, urges, he must go and answer. Happy 
are those who can make such a prayer, for they cannot 
fail to be heard. Behold, that is well and abundantly 
comforted. Nevertheless, this is not enough, but follows 
further: 


V. 13. And the Lord answered the angel that talked 
with me, kind words and comforting words. 


52 The prophet also heard how the Lord hears and 
answers the angel's prayer, even though the Lord 
speaks nothing to the prophet, so that the prophet might 
be comforted all the more, because he hears not only 
the mighty angel, but also the Lord Himself speak to the 
angel and promise him an answer. But what the friendly, 
sweet, comforting words have been, the angel 
announces to the prophet, as follows: 


V. 14. 15. And the angel that talked with me said 
unto me, Preach, saying, Thus saith the LORD of 
hosts, | have been very jealous over Jerusalem and 
Zion. But | am very wroth with the proud Gentiles: for 
| was but 2) a little wroth, but they help to destruction. 


(53) Look at all the words, how fatherly and heartfelt 
they are spoken. They sound no different than the words 
of a dear father, who after the rod lures his child back to 
him and gives him the very best words, lifts up and 
throws away the rod, yes, he is angry against the rod, 
scolds it and tramples it underfoot, as if the rod had done 
it and he had not. Then he explains his stomping in the 
best way, how he meant it so well, and was not anger, 
but only love; next to it he gives him a penny or an apple 
as a sign, so that the stupid child forgets the rod, and 
stands childlike to him again. God does the same with 
the Jews. And first he begins to rebuke the rue, as if he 
had not done it, but the Gentiles had done it, and says, 
"| have been jealous over Jerusalem," 2c. 


2) "only" is missing in the Erlanger. 


1792 Erl. 42, 151-154. interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 1, 14. 15. W. VI, 3324-3327. 


1793 





| have not been justly wroth to reject or forsake my 
people, but as a father punishes his child, and a husband 
his wife, and is wroth with her, so have | done. 

(54) For zeal is not evil wrath, which enemies have 
against one another, but is the wrath of love, a kindly, 
fatherly wrath, such as those who are angry with one 
another love one another. This anger serves to make 
love all the more fierce and new. For if such anger did 
not sometimes come between the love, then the love 
would become rotten, and the rust would eat it up like 
iron. But zeal sweeps it fine, and makes it ever new; as 


also the heathen says, Terentius [Andr. act. 3, 86. 3.) 
that love becomes new again as often as those who love 
each other are angry with each other. That is why | use 


to call angry love Zelum or zeal. For where love is angry, 
it does no harm. 

55. But when hatred and envy is angry, it corrupts and 
disturbs as long as it can. For the wrath of love seeks 
and wants to separate the evil (which it hates) from the 
good (which it loves), so that the good and its love may 
be kept, as a father wants to keep his dear child, but he 
wants to do away with sin; and a man also wants to keep 
his dear wife, but he wants to avoid her disgrace and 
unrighteousness. Again, the wrathful hatred drives in, 
and wants to destroy both the good with the evil and 
bring to nothing. 

56. So God also says here that he was not angry with 
Jerusalem out of hatred and enmity, but that he was 
jealous as a father and angry out of love, so that he 
would fight their evil and keep them as his children, and 
he himself interprets the zeal in this way and says: "| was 
a little angry", as if he should say: My zeal is a short, 
small anger, it does not last long; so he does not even 
bite, but stabs a little, so that he turns away the evil. Thus 
he excuses his anger, and so sweetly entices the heart 
of the people back to him. 

(57) And indeed, when one sees who he is who 
speaks like this, namely God Himself, these are sweet 
words, yes, words of life, joy and all bliss. For if a man 
were in death and in hell, and 





If he heard such words from God, he would become alive 
and happy from the words. But we let them go, regard 
them as if they were spoken by a man, do not believe 
that God Himself speaks; therefore we do not taste how 
sweet they are. 

(58) Then he rebuked the Gentiles who had been his 
servants, not saying that he was jealous over them, but 
that he was very angry with them, calling them proud and 
blaming them for helping to destroy them; that is, they 
did not seek to punish Jerusalem, for which God needed 
them, but to destroy them badly was their opinion. 

(59) The word "proud" in Hebrew XXXXX, | do not 
give enough in German, because it means to be secure, 
certain, free, without worry and fear. As when the great 
lords rely so highly on their property and power that they 
defy everyone at once, and sit so firmly that they think 
they cannot fail, as wisdom says in Proverbs Solomon 
Cap. 1, 33: "He who obeys me shall dwell securely, and 
be safe without fear of evil." So he also wants to say 
here: "My people are so shattered and shaken that no 
one can comfort them again; but the heathen are so safe 
and free that no one can frighten them, they make 
themselves believe that they have no need and that 
there is no wrath against them, that they have plagued 
my people so far. But not so, says God, but | am angry 
with them, and am not so well off as they think. Again, | 
am merciful toward my people, and am not so evil toward 
them as they think. 

(60) And here you see God's judgment and work, 
how He is angry with the secure, free, impudent, proud 
spirits, and merciful with the fearful, humble, afflicted 
spirits, that it is not a good sign, but terrible, when it is 
safe and well with someone, that he lives without fear 
and trembling for temporal power and good. For there 
goes this saying mightily, | am very wroth with the secure 
nations. Again, there is no evil sign, but only comfort, 
when there is fear, trembling, anxiety, sorrow and 
distress. For there goes the saying Isa. 66, 2: "My spirit 
rests on the humble, quiet spirits who fear my words." 


1794 Erl. 42, 154-156. interpretations on the prophets. 


61 All these things are now preached to the Jews for 
their comfort, that they should no longer fear anyone on 
earth, for they have two good promises: one, that God is 
jealous over them and still loves them as His children; 
the other, that He is hostile to their enemies and angry 
with them. Who will harm them now, when God is with 
them? Of whom shall they be afraid when God is angry 
with their enemies? He has soon shielded his own, and 
soon he has smitten those who oppose him. Who can 
stand against God? Follow: 


V.16. Therefore thus saith the LORD; | will return 
unto Jerusalem with mercy, and my house shall be 
built therein, saith the LORD of hosts; and the cord of 
the room shall be drawn in Jerusalem. 


(62) This is the year's fair, the jewel, or the gift, which 
he gives in addition to the words of comfort, as has been 
said, promising that the temple and the city of Jerusalem 
shall be rebuilt, that the Gentiles also shall not hinder, as 
has been done hitherto, but that it shall be accomplished 
and prosperous. This is what he means here, to turn 
back to Jerusalem with mercy, so that they will not only 
find it in words, but also in deeds and works, that he is 
merciful and gracious, and that his wrath is over. 

63. he brings forth two kinds of balls. The first, his 
house, the temple, in which the most important thing is 
that they are first provided with spiritual regiment 
according to the soul, through God's word and worship. 
For God dwells where His word and His glory are. 
Therefore, it is a great mercy (as he says here), not to 
build a house of wood and stones, but that God will dwell 
in it with His word, service and ministry, and be with 
them, teach them, and sanctify them. This is called 
God's house. For where His word is not, there He does 
not dwell, nor does He ask for the house; for since the 
word no longer remained, He had the Romans destroy 
the temple and the city. 

64 The other building is the city of Jerusalem, where 
the outward, worldly regime is included; which is also a 
great mercy. For the two regiments must be 





W7 VI, 3327-3330. 1795 


The spiritual for the soul, the temporal for the body. But 
that he says that the cord of the room should be drawn 
in Jerusalem, is briefly and so much said: One will see 
many carpenters and builders in Jerusalem, who now 
and then build in the city, here a house, there a house, 
so that the cord of the room will not celebrate nor lie idle, 
but will be used and drawn in all places. He also means 
by the same carpenter's cord not only the carpenter's 
cord, but also the stonemason's cord and all builders 
who measure and straighten their building with cords, 
lead, iron, rods. 


v.17. And preach again, saying, Thus saith the 
LORD of hosts; It shall be well with my cities again; 
and the LORD shall comfort Zion again, and shall 
choose Jerusalem again. 


65 Not only shall the temple and Jerusalem be built, 
but the cities of the land of Judah shall also prosper. But 
Jerusalem shall be chosen above all, that the LORD may 
dwell there, and she shall be the capital. And he shall 
comfort her, that is, he shall give her his word, and his 
service, and wives, and children, and houses, and 
courts, and goods, and honour, and all that pertaineth 
unto a holy city and habitation of God. In the same way 
as it was afflicted, devastated and desolated by the 
Chaldeans, all this will be restored, so that both the land 
and the cities will be restored to orderly rule and 
existence, all of which is a great promise, and at that 
time it was very difficult to believe, because it was in 
such a bad state. 

(66) In the Hebrew, when we say, "It shall be well with 
my cities," it means that the cities shall be scattered 
before a great God, that is, God shall do so much good 
to the people, and shall make them so that the cities 
shall be built again and again in the land, that the land 
shall be full of cities, as if they had been scattered and 
sown in three places, even as they lie scattered. With 
this word he shows how easy it is in his sight to 
reorganize a land and make it full of cities, as if he could 
scatter and sow cities as a farmer scatters grain in the 
field and sows it. 


1796 Erl. 42, 1S6-IZS. Interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 1, 17-21. 


W. VI, 3330-3333. 1797 





sows. He wants to do so much good for the land, 
because he considers the temporal good to be less than 
that which he scatters abundantly and throws into the 
rapids. Yes, who believes it? Should a man believe that 
God can scatter cities like grains, or even throw 
kingdoms into the raphe, if we cannot believe that He 
will or can feed our bellies for a day with a piece of 
bread? Fie on our unbelief that such beautiful, rich, 
powerful promises of God should be presented to him in 
vain. 


V. 18-21. And I lifted up mine eyes, and 
looked; and, behold, there were four horns 2c. 


67 This is another sermon, and brings another vision, 
which shows two things: first, four horns; and second, 
four smiths, who shall break such horns. And this vision 
also comes to pass like the former vision, that it is 
terrible to behold, though it is comforting; and the 
prophet also is terrified at it, saying, "Who are these?" 
As if he should say, Blowing horns; throwing smiths; 1) 
there is yet vain beating and slaying. For as their heart 
stood, so the visions appear, and they also accept them 
as their heart stands; that is, fear is in their heart, 
therefore everything they see or hear is terrible to them; 
as is the way of the stupid conscience, that it always 
thinks the sky is falling, and God stands behind it with 
the club. 

68 The angel himself indicates what the horns are, 
namely, that they are the Gentiles who have scattered 
not only Judah and Jerusalem but also Israel, that is, all 
the kingdoms and dominions around them. For this 
reason four horns appear, indicating, not, as some think, 
the four empires of Assyria, Babylon, Persia and Rome. 
For the Romans had not yet harmed the Jews or 
scattered them, as the angel says here of the horns. For 
the Romans were not yet so powerful at that time, nor 
had the Persians done them much good, nor scattered 
them; but that the Scripture divides the world into four 
parts. Morning, evening, noon, midnight; therefore it 
also makes four winds, 


1) The Latin translator has given this "throw" by xsrcutiunt, to beat 
them. 





Matth. 24, 31. So the four horns are nothing else than all 
the Gentiles (as the angel himself indicates) who had 
scattered the Jews around. For their neighbors round 
about, in all four places, were enemies to them, and 
helped to destroy them. It has been known long enough 
that in the Scriptures "horns" are called kingdoms and 
dominions, as is especially proven in Daniel [Cap. 8, 3. 
ff.] and St. John's Revelation [Cap. 13, 1. 11.17, 7. 12.]. 
009 And the four smiths shall discourage the four horns, 
and turn them away from the land of Judah; that is, Fear 
no more the horns: they have scattered you, it is true; ye 
think too much of them; but they shall do it no more. For 
there are four blacksmiths, and they shall defend them. 
Who are they? They are the angels, to whom such 
kingdoms and dominions are commanded, as said 
above [§ 42]. They are to deter them, that is, to keep 
them away and turn them away, so that nothing will 
happen to you from them to prevent the temple. 

(70) This little word "smiths" in Hebrew means not only 
smiths, but all kinds of builders who belong to building, 
such as smiths, carpenters, masons, stonemasons, 
carpenters, 2) goldsmiths, and what deals with wood, 
stone, iron and ore. Therefore, some would think that 
these four builders mean all kinds of people who were to 
help build the temple buildings around; but | remain of 
the opinion that they are the angels, and therefore 
appear in the builders' persons to comfort the people, so 
that they are sure that the building should continue 
unhindered. For as the first vision shows how the angels 
are among the myrtles, and all is quiet in all the world, 
so this vision shows that in such quietness the building 
should be promoted without any hindrance. Therefore, 
for the sake of the weak, the dear angels must come and 
appear in the guise of builders. One carries a carpenter's 
axe and cord; the other a stone axe and chisel; the third 
an axe and haft; the fourth a hammer and tongs. As if to 
say, Four horns have scattered Judah, but four builders 
shall set it up again; that is, fear not, ye have now so 
many to build you.

help than those who have broken you. For this they are 
to be built stronger than those have been to break. For 
they will scare off those and keep them away, so that 
the ban must go away and their appearance will be 
enough. 


[They appear as builders, therefore it must be built. 
Behold, God so delicately and sweetly comforts the 
poor, stupid, shaken consciences. After all, it is a fine, 
gracious, sweet God. Blessed is he who believes it. 





The second chapter. 


V.1-3. And | lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, 
behold, a man had a measuring line in his hand. And | 
said, Where goest thou? 2c. 


This is also a new sermon and a new vision, there are 
three angels. The first one appears with a cord or 
measure. The other one, who is used to speak with the 
prophet, who is Michael, goes out, that is, he comes forth 
into the vision. For in Hebrew to go forth is as much as 
to stand out, to come into place. This angel is to interpret 
the vision, as he did before. The third angel also comes 
forth and commands your angel Michael what he is to 
say to the prophet. And, as far as | understand, because 
the two angels bump into each other and meet, this is 
the opinion that the angel Michael wants to come forth 
and point out to the prophet the face of the physical 
Jerusalem, how it is to be built; but before he does this, 
the third angel comes to meet him and commands him 
to speak about the spiritual Jerusalem. For this whole 
chapter speaks of the spiritual Jerusalem, that is, of the 
kingdom of Christ, which was signified by Jerusalem. 
That is why | have spared the allegories or secret 
interpretations in the previous chapter, because the 
prophet himself points them out and gives them here. 

2 For after he has sufficiently comforted in the 
previous, first chapter, and promised with two visions 
and many words, how Jerusalem should be rebuilt bodily 
and temporally, he continues, before he continues to 
preach about the bodily Jerusalem, and shows how it 
should be with Jerusalem afterwards, when she now 
stands there in a temporal building, and says: it should 
not remain so, but 





The angels said, "Let there be such a great Jerusalem, 
which cannot be measured, but shall be without walls, 
as far as the earth is, that God Himself will be a fiery blue 
around it. Therefore the angel appears with the 
measuring rod, just as the prophet's and the people's 
heart stands; for they do not yet know of any other 
Jerusalem, ohn which is measured and has its space, 
how long and wide it is bodily. For we have often heard 
how the faces appear, according to which the people are 
minded in the heart, so here Zechariah, because he 
measures in the heart the bodily city Jerusalem, must 
also see the measuring cord. But it is interpreted to him 
much differently, namely, that [it] shall become an 
adequate city, according to the fleshly room 2c. 

(3) For the man or angel with the measuring line 
should certainly know how long and wide Jerusalem 
would be, or that he would not need to know, since the 
people knew and saw before their eyes how large it 
should be. Therefore the measuring line goes to another 
measurement, namely, to the spiritual Jerusalem, and 
the man with the measuring line is Christ, our Lord, the 
only builder of the new Jerusalem. 

4. but that he has the measuring cord in his hand 
means that he distributes the Holy Spirit with his gifts, to 
each his measure and modest portion, as Paul teaches 
Rom. 12, 6. 1 Cor. 12, 7. ff. and Eph. 4, 11. For 
Christianity goes no further, nor is it narrower, than as 
far as the Spirit of Christ reaches and is given. This is 
the spiritual measuring.

But he reaches as far as the world is, as he speaks 
through the prophet Joel [Cap. 3, 1.]: "I will pour out my 
spirit over all flesh", that is, over all men in all the world. 
Not that all men receive the Holy Spirit, for that several 
part persecutes him. Neither does he say that he will put 
or give his Spirit into all hearts, but that he will pour out 
his Spirit on all flesh, which is nothing else than that the 
Holy Spirit is sent by the word of the gospel upon all men 
in all the world, and offered to them all, and so hovers 
over all men in the world where the gospel is preached. 
Just as Christ says [Luc. 11, 20] that the kingdom of God 
has come upon the Jews, since he cast out devils by the 
Spirit; and Matth. 10, 7. and Luc. 10, 9. 10. commands 
the apostles to say to the unbelievers: "The kingdom of 
God has come upon you", and to depart from there. All 
of which is said, "The gospel has come to you, and in it 
and with it has hovered over you, and has been there 
and offered Christ's kingdom, that is, the Father, Son and 
Holy Spirit with all grace. But you did not want it 2c. That 
therefore this measuring, and the Holy Spirit being 
poured out upon all flesh, is nothing else but the Holy 
Spirit being offered in all the world by the word to all men, 
hovering over all and being there, ready to help them, 
heaven being open as far as the world is, no place being 
shut out; and all these things being begun at Jerusalem, 
and from thence coming into all the world in like manner. 
Thus the physical Jerusalem has become a spiritual one. 

(5) Behold, this is called great comfort, that the Jews 
are promised not only to build again the perishable 
temple and the perishable city of Jerusalem, and the 
perishable land of Judah, but also immediately thereafter 
an everlasting Jerusalem. For the prophets, as | have 
said above [1 ff] and in Habakkuk [Cap. 2, § 2 ff], hang 
and tie the two Jerusalem and the two kingdoms to each 
other, as the spiritual Jerusalem to the physical one, and 
the throne of David to Christ's throne, in_ their 
prophesying to indicate that Christ should and must 
come, when the physical Jerusalem and the Jewish reign 





would still be standing. For he was to start at the same 
and make a spiritual, eternal one out of it. Therefore also 
in Zechariah, in the midst and under the prophecy of the 
physical Jerusalem to be built, the prophecy of the 
spiritual Jerusalem must be mixed in and attached. Since 
Jerusalem has been destroyed and the reign of the Jews 
has ceased for so long, Christ's kingdom must have 
come and the prophecy must have been fulfilled. 

6th And because we have come to the interpretation, 
we want to bring the visions in the first chapter also to 
Christ's kingdom, about which they publicly indicate 
happiness according to the letter of the fleshly 
Jerusalem. To the first: The angel who holds and prays 
among the myrtles, and proclaims the sweet, living, 
comforting words, is Christ Himself, who prays for us, 
and represents us to the Father through His blood [Rom. 
8, 34. Heb. 7, 25.], who lay in the right prison of Babel, 
that is, under the devil, the prince of the world [Jn. 16, 
11.], in sins and death, seventy years, that is, all our 
lives. For seventy years is almost the time of human life, 
as the 90th Psalm, v. 10. says. He also proclaims to us 
from God the sweet, comforting gospel, in which is 
forgiveness of sins and redemption from death, by which 
the right Jerusalem is also built and inhabited by God. 

(7) The fact that he rides a red horse signifies his 
miraculous warfare and victory. For a horse is a beast of 
war, as we have said [Cap. 1, § 35]. He himself says 
afterwards, Cap. 10, 5, that he will prepare Judah like a 
well-armed horse for battle. Such a horse is the humanity 
of Christ, in which he fought for us against the devil, 
death, and sin, but only with restraint and suffering. For 
the angel keeps still among the myrtles and does not lash 
out. Therefore, the same horse must also be red, to 
signify his blood, which he shed for us. 

(8) Among the myrtles, that is, among the Jews, he did 
this. For the myrtles are tame and cultivated trees. So 
the Jews were not a wild, desolate, forsaken people like 
the Gentiles, whom the 96th Psalm, v. 12, also calls wild 
trees when it says: "All the trees of the forest rejoice," but 
they had the fathers, the prophets, God's laws, 


1802 ed. 4], 163-166. Interpretations on the Prophets. W. vi, 3340-3343. 


1803 





Service, promises, so that they were drawn to the best, 
until Christ. 

9. in the floodplain or in the bottom, not on a mountain, 
means the synagogue and Jewish people, which in 
Christ's time was low and despised by the Gentile rulers, 
whom the 76th Psalm, v. 5, calls "mountains of robbery". 
For Judaism was under the Romans and was completely 
oppressed; that is, at the end of the Jewish reign Christ 
came to make a mountain out of the meadow above all 
the mountains, Isa. 2:2. 

The other angels, which kept behind him with red, 
brown, and white horses, and were sent into all 
countries, are the dear apostles and their successors, 
who proclaim peace and quietness of conscience in all 
countries, by Christ's command. That some are red 
means those who, according to the Lord Christ, have 
also shed their blood, as St. Peter, James, Paul. The 
brown ones, which are not quite red, nor white, mean 
those who have not shed their blood or been killed, but 
have suffered much in life, as. St. John, Lucas, 
Athanasius, Hilarius and the like. The white ones are 
those who have suffered nothing in their bodies, but 
have also been in honor, and have led a pure, innocent 
life, as. St. Ambrose, Augustine and their like. These all 
answer to the man among the myrtles, that is, they do 
submissively and obediently what Christ commands and 
interprets to them. 

The other face also belongs here, full of the four 
builders. For they are the apostles and teachers, sent 
into the four places of the world, not only to build up 
Christendom with the Word, but also to strike down and 
subdue with the Word of God those who oppose it, as 
the wise and prudent, as the pagans and heretics were, 
as St. Paul says in 2 Cor. 10:4, 5, that our weapons are 
not carnal, but mighty through God, to break down all 
prudence that exalts itself against the knowledge of God 
2c, as he also teaches Titum [Cap. 1, 9.] to destroy 
bishops who are mighty in doctrine. For we see that in 
the end the gospel has remained above, and has 
disturbed both tyrants and heretics. 

12. but that such visions are strange and cruel to the 
prophet, means that flesh 





and blood shuns and shuns the work of God and the 
cross of Christ and His own, for it cannot understand it; 
it looks too small to do such a great thing, just as these 
builders are too small to deter and turn away the horns 
of the heathen. Men of war should have appeared with 
armor and cannon, with horses and chariots. What shall 
ball men get? So it seems nothing at all, when tyrants 
and heretics rage, that the Christians should win. There 
are horns, that is, kings, against the builders, and lie on 
high. 

(13) So all the sayings and doings of our God are 
foolish in the sight of men. He hangs and hounds 
builders in all the warlike kingdoms. With building he 
wants to conquer. Who has ever heard this more? And 
above [Cap. 1, 11], when he proclaims peace and quiet 
tranquility, he lets horses be seen, which serve for war, 
and wants to build zero again with wars, or have peace. 
But this is how it is in the spirit. When one preaches the 
gospel, all these things happen: one makes and keeps 
peace, and wars all the same; one builds and breaks all 
the same. Against the unbelievers and heretics goes 
warring and breaking; with the believers goes peace and 
building. And indeed he does not say here that he would 
break the horns by the builders, but that he would scare 
and turn away. For the gospel does not hurl itself at the 
kings, nor overthrow them, but so strongly comforts them 
against their raging that they create nothing with the 
Christians, and must finally give way to the cross, and let 
the Christians remain. That is enough of the 
interpretations. Now let us look at one part of the text. 

(14) Enough has been said about the man with the 
measuring cord and the three angels. Let us hear the 
words of the third angel, which he says to the other 
angel: 


V. 4. Go, tell the boy, and say, Jerusalem shall be 


inhabited without walls, before the great multitude of 


men and cattle that shall be therein. 
These words may not be understood of the fleshly 
Jerusalem, for she was built 


1) This "siehet" is given in Latin by viZstur. 


1804 Erl. 4s, 166-168. interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 


2, 4,5. W. vi, 3343-3345. 1805 





with walls, as a city is to be built, as we read in Ezra 
[Cap. 4, 12] and Nehemiah [Cap. 6, 15. 7, 1. ff]. So it did 
not happen that Jerusalem was without walls, without 
being desolate. But he says here that it shall not be 
desolate, but inhabited, so full that there shall not be a 
wall before a great multitude of men. For this is the 
reason why it should be without walls, that there should 
be so many men and cattle in it. Now it must be admitted 
that a city is not forced to be without walls because so 
many people are inside; suburbs can be added and also 
walled up. In short, so many people will never live 
together that it would not be possible to build a wall 
around them, and so they would have to remain open for 
the sake of the crowd. Since, according to all custom, 
walls are built first where the greatest number of people 
live together, the contradiction should be promised. 

(15) But, as it is said [3], this is to signify that 
Jerusalem should become such a great village, as far as 
the world is, around which a wall cannot be made, only 
for the sake of the multitude of men. For who will build 
such a wall, when all the world dwells within, if men 
multiply without ceasing? That is, as we have said 4], the 
kingdom of Christ shall come upon all the earth, and the 
blessing promised to Abraha shall be spread among all 
the Gentiles [Gal. 3, 14.ff So Lyra leads a Jewish master 
or rabbi over this prophet, who says that in the time of 
Messiah Jerusalem shall become so great that her walls 
shall be the end of the world. He has seen something; 
yet the Jews do not believe. It cannot be spoken of the 
bodily Jerusalem. 

16 He also speaks of the cattle, that so much should 
be in them. But what shall the cattle do in the kingdom 
of Christ, if they are not left in the flesh of Jerusalem, but 
go into the suburbs? But because he speaks of 
Jerusalem, that it should be like a large village or town, 
without walls, he also includes that which is used to be 
in villages and towns. For in cities there are walls, 
towers, horses, armor, defenses, and all that belongs to 
the battle; item, court, scholars, rain. 





and what belongs more to secular authority. But in the 
villages there are farmers and cattle, and what serves 
for food. This is another indication that this is to be a 
spiritual Jerusalem, in which there is to be no physical 
warfare or strife, but only the nourishment of the soul in 
secure peace. Thus men and beasts are two kinds of 
Christians, the strong and the weak. For the strong are 
men, and can instruct and carry the beasts, that is, the 
weak, outwardly, as St. Paul teaches Romans 14:1 and 
15:1.) 


V. 5. | will, says God, be a fiery wall around them. 


(17) Again, we see that this is to be a spiritual 
Jerusalem. It shall be without walls, and yet have a wall. 
yet have a wall. Where God Himself is the wall, and there 
is no physical wall, there must certainly be a spiritual city. 
For God cannot be a physical wall. 

(18) Are not these words exceedingly comforting and 
sweet? Where are the Christians here who believe this? 
Give me one who believes this saying to be true and 
believes that God is around him as a fiery wall wherever 
he walks or stands. Of whom should he be afraid? There 
have been many kings who had two hundred thousand, 
three hundred thousand men around them. In the past, 
Attila, the king of the Hungarians, had five hundred 
thousand men with him, so that he frightened not only 
the Roman Empire but also the whole world; and the 
Turk also has many people around him. Yes, the king of 
Persia, Xerxes, had eleven hundred thousand men with 
him. Now, all these in a heap, what are they against him 
who has God as a fiery wall around him? Beggars they 
are, and poor, defenseless people; and with all such 
great food and heavy armor, since much rises and much 
belongs to it, they do not like so much that they would 
be sure of their life for a moment. Attila, in his happiest 
night, had to choke on the blood that used to weld out of 
his nose, and the king of Persia had to escape with a 
barge from the sea. But a Christian

He has no pay for his people, neither armor nor food, he 
goes free, and has a fiery wall around him, which keeps 
his life safe for eternity. 

19 The 125th Psalm, v. 1, 2, also sings beautifully: 
"Those who trust in the Lord will not fall, and will remain 
forever, like Mount Zion. There are mountains round 
about Jerusalem, and the LORD is round about his 
people from henceforth even for ever." Mountains are 
around Jerusalem, and the Lord Himself is around His 
people. Mountains are better than walls; indeed, who 
wants to fight against a city over mountains? But here it 
is even stronger and more certain that the Lord himself 
will be a fiery wall. Who will or can fight against and 
through fire? In order that God may comfort us, as He 
will not only be a wall to protect us, but also be terrible to 
our enemies, and consume them like fire; which He also 
proved before in the case of the children of Israel, 
Exodus 14:19, 25, when the angel of God with the fiery 
cloud stood between the Egyptians and Israel, so that 
they could not come together all night, until in the 
morning God threw the Egyptians into the sea and 
destroyed them. Likewise read the second book of 
Kings, Cap. 6, 16. 17. how the prophet Elisha showed 
his servant fiery mountains and horses around the city, 
and said: With us are many more than with them. 

(20) But this requires faith, because God keeps His 
fiery walls so hidden that not only can no man see them, 
but He also causes His own to be persecuted and 
strangled, as if He had not drawn a straw or a cobweb 
around them, let alone a fiery wall. Therefore the flesh is 
too weak, it cannot understand nor believe such sayings 
and comforting promises; the Holy Spirit must give and 
teach. 


[And | want to be in it, and | want to be glorious in 
it. 2) 

21. lastly, he will also be in the glory, that is, he will be 
with his Spirit in the Christians, dwelling with them, 
teaching them and guiding them, so that they may have 
glory, that is, he will do by deed, that they may not have

They should not only boast and defy God with a good 
and happy conscience, as if they were sure that God is 
their own and that they are God's own, but they should 
also be praised in all the world, above all nations with 
their idols, as if they could not do to their nations as God 
does to His people. For this is also what St. Paul says in 
Romans 5:11: "Not only this, but we boast of God," that 
is, we defy and insist on it with a happy conscience, and 
are sure that God is ours, takes care of us, is fire and 
wall, mountain and armor around us. Again, of the 
unbelievers he says Rom. 3:23: "They lack the glory 
which they ought to have in GOD." This is the honor or 
glory that he wants here, since he says that he will dwell 
with honor in Jerusalem, just as before they were 
scattered with all shame, and could not boast that God 
dwelt with them and was their own, nor could they be 
otherwise described in all the world than that they had 
forsaken their God, and were now without God. 
Therefore, it follows: 


V.6. 0, o! flee from the midnight land, says the Lord; 
for | have scattered you to the four winds under 
heaven, says the Lord. 


(22) Having promised the spiritual Jerusalem, that it 
should be future soon after the earthly Jerusalem, when 
it is rebuilt and made ready, he now exhorts and exhorts 
the Jews together to come from all countries and help to 
make ready the earthly Jerusalem, for the sake of the 
future spiritual Jerusalem, which is to be awaited in the 
earthly one. For there it shall begin, and from thence it 
shall spread abroad. And | will therefore say, Because it 
is so, that | will make of the small earthly Jerusalem a 
great and glorious spiritual Jerusalem, and will be the 
wall thereof, and dwell therein with great honor, that ye 
shall no more be ashamed among the heathen, as those 
that are without God, and forsaken of me: Come ye 
therefore, flee, flee from the midnight land, that is, from 
Babylon and Assyria, whither ye are carried captive by 
the kings of Assyria and Babylon. And not only you, the 
same, shall come from the north, but also 


1808 Erl. 42, 170-172. interpretation of Zechariah (I.), Cap. 


2, 6. 7. W. vi, 3343-3351. 1809 





All the others also, whither they flew round about in the 
time of the destruction; all of them, all of them round 
about, and from all places, come again, and restore 
Jerusalem, that ye may be made partakers of the honors 
to come. And specially he calleth unto the Jews and to 
the inhabitants of Jerusalem before all, saying: 


v. 7. O Zion, who dwell with the daughter of 
Babylon, escape. 


023 For the same citizens of Zion shall be the first to 
receive it, because Christ should come of the tribe of 
Judah. And fine he calls them Zion, though they are yet 
at Babylon. For they do not belong to Babylon, but to 
Zion. He also says especially, "You who dwell in 
Babylon," and does not say, "You who are a stranger in 
Babylon," as the Scripture says of their fathers, 
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, that they were strangers in 
the land [Gen. 21:34, 26, 3, 37:1]. With this the prophet 
indicates that many of the Jews have become completely 
Babylonian, and have set themselves to remain there 
forever, as those who have come over there with wife 
and child, house and goods among the Gentiles, and 
have let their fatherland Zion go, and despise it. For not 
all the Jews went up again to rebuild Jerusalem; indeed, 
the less part, as Ezra [Cap. 2, 2. ff. 8, 1. ff.] well indicates. 
As it is always the case that God's word has the lesser 
part of disciples. Therefore the prophet touches them, 
and gives them a sting, as if he should say: Oh dear 
Jews, you are citizens of Zion, how you forget your 
fatherland, and despise the future promises of Christ, 
and sit down in Babylon, and no longer want to be guests 
and prisoners there, but citizens, and dwell there; let your 
wife, child, house, goods and friends endure and hinder 
you, so that you do not also come and help to build. Be 
ashamed of yourselves that you want to be Babylonian, 
if you are Zionist. Who has ever despised his fatherland? 
Is it not natural, as all Gentiles say and experience 
testifies, to love the fatherland? 

024 So this preaching was done, that it might be sent 
to Babylon to admonish the Jews that believed not, or 
were slothful, or were negligent, or were hardened. For 
there is no doubt that there were many of the Jews who 





have had their mockery of the word of God, as that it was 
impossible to restore Jerusalem, so _ shamefully 
destroyed, much more impossible that it should become 
so glorious. For God's word is always such that it 
pretends to be foolish and impossible things, at which 
reason must be annoyed by its cleverness, and faith can 
hardly stand here. Therefore many will have mocked at 
that time, and said: Awe yes, go and build, you shall build 
something fine; you are skilled to sing like the donkey; 
and likewise. Just as the citizens of Succoth and Pnuel 
also mocked Gideon. Judg. 8, 6.7 For God's word must 
be a mockery to reason, and few there be that believe 1) 
it. So he himself will confess afterwards [Cap. 8, 6.] that 
some have considered it impossible, some a mockery, 
since he says: "And if it seems impossible before these 
others, should it therefore also be impossible before 
me?" Item, Cap. 4, 10: "Who is he that despiseth these 
few days?" 

25 Therefore he also meets their thoughts, when he says 
above [P. 6. 1): "O flee from the land of the midnight; for 
| have scattered you to the four winds under heaven." As 
if he should say: Flee, flee and escape; let nothing 
endure you in Babylon, nor in other places. Whoever 
does not want to go, let him stay there, be it wife, friend, 
property or honor. Do not think that it is impossible or 
disgraceful to restore Jerusalem. For |, who have 
scattered you abroad, and have put you to shame, am 
able and willing to gather you again, and to make you 
honourable. The Gentiles did not do it, but | scattered 
you; otherwise they would have had to leave it. So | can 
help you again; what are you looking for in the land that 
lies toward the midnight and toward the darkness, which 
is avain misfortune? Return to your homeland, which lies 
toward noon and toward the light, which means 
happiness and salvation. So it is very difficult to leave the 
world and cling to the word that the prophet must use 
these words, "flee" and "escape", 2) that is, you must do 
violence to yourselves and consider freshly, otherwise it 
will not come off. For Adam is too heavy, and holds too 
hard.

and spirit fight against each other. Therefore it must be 
jerked and torn out and broken through. This is what 1) 
he means here: "O Zion, escape," that is, break away, 
and let nothing be too dear to you in Babylon. 

But here you see, 2) that it is the custom of the 
Scriptures to understand the whole world around by the 
four winds under heaven, or by the four oerters, evening, 
morning, noon, and midnight. In which way Christ also 
speaks Matth. 24, 31: "He will send his angels with 
trumpets to gather his elect from the four winds" 2c. 

(27) Item, that the inhabitants of all the cities and the 
villages belonging to them are called daughters. So here 
the "daughter of Babylon" is called the people of 
Babylon, and afterwards [v. 10; Cap. 9, 9]: "Rejoice, you 
daughter of Zion," So, when Jacob announces the divine 
blessing over Ephraim in Gen. 49, 22, he says that the 
daughters are in regiment, that is, the cities in the 
country should have a principality and regiment. For to 
have a regiment in the land is a great gift and a gracious 
blessing from God. Item, in the book of Joshua we find, 
how the cities with their daughters, that is, with their 
associated spots and small towns or villages are divided 
[Jos. 15, 45. ff. 17, 11.], that it is even a Hebrew way to 
speak so, and we do not speak so in German. 


V. 8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; He hath sent 
me unto the Gentiles which spoiled you: the glory is 
gone. He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of mine 
eye. 

28 Here he explains and further deletes the promise 
of the spiritual Jerusalem. But the text in Hebrew reads 
thus: For thus says the LORD of hosts, after glory he has 
sent me to the Gentiles 2c. The word [XXXX 
XXxX]according to glory, is a 
little dark, because we do not understand the Hebrew 
language kind well, or the Holy Spirit has so darkly 
wanted to speak here of Christ out of

thoughtful counsel. We have this much certainty that this 
message is to take place after the glory, which is 
indicated by the words "after the glory", that is, 
afterward, when the glory is before. But what glory he 
means, the text does not give, therefore he makes many 
thoughts and various interpretations. 

29 The first may be that Christ should come after the 
glory, that is, of the kings of Babylon and Persia, that is, 
when they have now perished and their kingdoms are 
over; lest the Jews should think that Christ would come 
so soon, because the empire of Persia was still standing. 
Therefore he wants to say, the glory of the empire must 
first go away, he will not come at the time of the empire. 
In this way Paul also speaks of the Antichrist in 2 Thess. 
2, 3, that he should come, but not before, because the 
Roman Empire was gone. In order to understand the text 
more clearly, we have translated and arranged it in this 
way: "He has sent me to the Gentiles; the glory is gone." 

(30) The other opinion may be, that Christ should 
come after the glory of the Jewish people, that the Holy 
Spirit should thereby indicate how the earthly Jerusalem 
and the fleshly kingdom should cease through Christ's 
coming. For this is how it happened: When Christ was 
present, the tribe of David had lost the rule, and the 
Machabees from the priestly tribe ruled, then the 
Romans and Herod; so that the glory of the Jewish 
kingdom was gone, and some of foreign blood were 
kings. For Jacob had also proclaimed beforehand in Gen 
49:10 that the tribe of Judah would have princes and 
teachers until Shiloh the Messiah came. For after that, 
when Christ was come among the Gentiles, and was 
preached, Jerusalem also was distressed, because the 
glory was already departed. On this opinion the text must 
stand thus: After the glory he sent me; or, He sent me 
when the glory was departed, that he might tell the time, 
and give a sign, when the new Jerusalem should begin, 
even when they should see that their glorious kingdom 
was ended, and that they had strangers for kings. Then 
they should look to him and wait for him. | like this 
interpretation best, and 


1812 eri, 175-177.interpretation of Zechariah (1.), .Cap. 


2, 8. W. vi, 3353-3356. 1813 





Methinks it is right, because it agrees with the saying of 
Jacob Gen 49:10. And because he speaks to the Jews, 
it is believable that he speaks of their glory, of which they 
held most dear and coveted highly. 

The third opinion, which is not far from this next one, 
is that not only the time of the future kingdom of Christ 
would be determined, but also the manner and form, 
which Christ and his kingdom would lead outwardly, to 
the extent: You Jews want to understand us prophets 
carnally, as if we preach about a bodily, earthly kingdom 
of Christ, which would be glorious and splendid before 
the world (as happened before and now). No, all that will 
then be over and have an end. Forsake this, and hold 
that it is all that was to come to pass; but this kingdom, 
which is to come after this, will outwardly be seen as 
dishonest, shameful and wretched. For it shall lie under 
the cross. So after the glorious earthly kingdom will come 
a poor, miserable kingdom, according to outward 
appearance, so that you will no longer be allowed to 
gape and hope for the glory of a worldly kingdom. 

32 For that these words speak of Christ and his 
kingdom is easily proved. First, that it has never 
happened that this prophet Zechariah was sent to the 
Gentiles whom they had robbed. For he should have 
gone to the Assyrians, the Medes, the Babylonians, the 
Chaldeans, and, as he says hard before, to the four 
winds, that is, to all the Gentiles, and preached; for all 
these Gentiles did evil to the Jews and robbed them. On 
the other hand, this did not happen, nor will it ever 
happen, that the Gentiles, to whom the Jews had to be 
subjected, would in turn have robbed the Jews, as the 
text here says in a dry way. The Assyrians may have 
been robbed by the Chaldeans, the Chaldeans by the 
Persians, the Persians by the Greeks, the Greeks by the 
Romans, and so on, but never by the Jews. But Christ 
fulfilled this text; he came to all the Gentiles through the 
gospel, and also brought among himself spiritually those 
who had previously been among the Jews, his people, 
bodily. This is also indicated by the words in which he 
speaks: 





33 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; After glory hath he 
sent me unto the Gentiles. Who is this Me? Is it 
Zechariah? No; for it is written before, Thus saith the 
LORD of hosts, He hath sent me. With all force the text 
forces that the LORD of hosts himself speaks here in his 
own person, and says: "He has sent me." He who 
speaks is also sent; the Lord of hosts sends the Lord of 
hosts. For no one can send himself, for by sending he 
testifies that there is another who sends, and another 
who is sent. Thus all the Jews confess, and it is true, that 
this name "LORD of hosts" is not assigned to anyone in 
Scripture, except to the right natural God, who is only 
One. Therefore, it is here that in the same unified 
Godhead, the two personalities must be both right, 
natural, unified God, both the sender and the sent. 

34 And this saying confirms that our Lord Jesus 
Christ, sent full of God the Father (as the Gospels teach), 
is right natural God with the Father. For where here the 
sent person should not be God himself, the text (as the 
Scripture should read) should read thus: The Lord says: 
Go, do this, talk to that; so that he turns to another, and 
does a command. But here he turns to no one, nor 
commands anyone, 1) but the person who speaks in 
God's place remains, and tells what he is commanded. 
"Thus saith the Lord, He hath sent me"; this is spoken in 
German enough, that the Lord speaks and confesses 
that he is sent; just as he writes above (Cap. 1, 16], 
"Thus says the Lord, | will return to Jerusalem," and the 
like. There one hears that God speaks full of Himself, 
and He who turns to Jerusalem is no one but the same 
God who says it of Himself. So there is also no one who 
is sent, but the Lord, who says such things full of himself. 

35And, what is more, look at the sequence in the text, 
and you will find that the same person who says, "The 
Lord has sent me to the Gentiles," quickly speaks in one 
tone and in one voice.

The clergyman has broken off the property, he has 
touched the apple of the Lord's eye. So one had to help 
the Scripture, God grant, we are Christians or not. But 
let the devil go with his own. 

(41) But if there be a Christian, and he believe these 
things to be true, beloved, what shall he think when he 
looketh upon him that harmeth him? Of course, he must 
not think much of anger or vengeance; he must not only 
be patient, but also merciful and pitiful toward his enemy, 
saying, "Oh, you poor man, what are you doing? Do you 
do nothing to me, but reach into the eye of the one who, 
alas, is too powerful for you, and is called God 2c. From 
this he is moved not only to suffer patiently, but also to 
plead, yes, even to die for his enemies, if he would save 
them from the wrath, which they grasp into your eyes. 
Now nothing is more unpleasant’ than to make a lot of 
fumbling in the eyes. In order that God may show 
Himself to us for comfort, to the enemies for terror, how 
disgusting and tender He is to tolerate when we are 
touched, so that it is not necessary for us to be angry or 
to take revenge. He does not deny that we must be 
touched, because he says, "He who touches you"; but 
let him not prosper who refrains. 

042 Therefore he will say, Ye Jews, ye are hitherto 
afflicted of the heathen round about. Now therefore let 
us make it henceforth, that not only these Gentiles, but 
all the Gentiles that afflict you, shall afflict me. They shall 
come down again, and be among you that are 
Christians, and hear me; as follows: 


V. 9 For, behold, | will weave my hand over them, 
and they shall be a spoil to them that served them; that 
ye may know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me. 

(43) He still speaks who professes to be sent by God, 
and yet presents himself as a God who is mighty in all 
the world, and wants to make the Gentiles a prey for the 
Jews; which he claims to be such a great miracle that he 
boasts that one should notice that he is sent by God. 
And again he boasts that he is sent by God, and yet he 
says that he wants to make the Gentiles, as a God, a 
prey; he wants to be God, 





and yet be sent by God. Of which we have said above 
34 ff.] have said enough, as this place powerfully proves 
that Christ must be right God and man. 

44 And to confirm that he should bring the Gentiles to 
the obedience of faith through the word, Rom. 1:16, he 
now declares the work for which he is sent, and that he 
should bring about such obedience, saying, "I! will weave 
my hand over them. 2c. As if to say, For this purpose | 
am sent to the Gentiles who have robbed you, not only 
to defend you, so beautifully and kindly that whoever 
touches you will touch the apple of my eye, but further | 
will make it so that they in turn will become your spoil* 
who before had to be their subjects. For above [v. 8.], 
when he says, "He hath sent me unto the Gentiles"; "he 
that toucheth you" 2c., is cut short, and badly said of 
sending, nothing at all/ how he should direct the sending, 
or what the command would be. That the Jews might fill 
the gaps in such speech with such a carnal mind, and 
think: Because he is sent to the Gentiles to create so 
much that no one should touch us, he will accomplish 
this with horse and chariot and mighty warriors, and 
defend us by force. But in order to counteract such 
reasoning, he has not only set it beforehand that he will 
first be sent "after glory", and that his command will be 
carried out without worldly pomp and glory, but also here 
himself indicates the way in which it will happen: "I will 
weave my hand over them"; not your sword, not your 
bow, but my hand shall do it, and so do that | will weave 
it over them. 

(45) There we see that it shall not be with the stroke 
of the sword, but God's hand will do it. For the word 
"weave" here does not mean to lift up the hand, as he 
usually speaks, as it is written in the Psalter now and 
then [Ps. 106, 26. Ps. 21, 14. Ps. 10, 12.]: "He lifted up 
his hands to strike them down"; item, "Arise, O Lord, let 
your right hand be lifted up" 2c., but it means to go over 
and float, just as the priests weaved their sacrifice before 
the altar in the four places of the

1819 





World; therefore it is called Webeopfer or Webe [4 Mos. 
8, 11. 21. 3 Mos., 30.]. So also he will here weave his 
hand over the Gentiles, and let it hover in the four places 
of the world (that is, in all the world), not to overthrow 
them, or to cast them down to the ground; for that is, to 
lift up or exalt his hand over them, but by his Word and 
Spirit he will weave and hover over the Gentiles in all the 
world, so that they will be converted, and give 
themselves kindly and willingly to the spoil, and to servile 
service, both to God and to the apostles; as Paul writes 
that the Macedonians did, 2 Cor. 9, 2. For this hand 
weaving is a kind, gracious weaving. In which way he 
also speaks Ps. 68, 10: He will let a gracious rain weave 
and float now and then. For it is the same word that is 
written here. 

46 And such a work, he says, should be a sign by 
which it should be known that God has sent him, that is, 
it will be believed that Christ, the true God, has been sent 
by God. For it is also an unheard-of, unspeakable work, 
that Christ is thus accepted in the world; as St. Paul also 
boasts 1 Tim. 3, 16. and says: "It is publicly hastened 
great, godly mystery, which is revealed in the flesh, 
justified in the Spirit, appeared to the angels, preached 
to the Gentiles, believed by the world, taken up into 
glory." For if we consider how foolish it is in the sight of 
reason to preach that a Jewish man is the Son of God 
and Lord over all, when He Himself was crucified and 
died by His own people [Rom. 9:5, Apost. 2:36], and how 
mightily all that is high in the race has opposed it; and 
how even the apostles acted without all weapons and 
resistance, but also with much suffering and death in it, 
we must say that it is not a man's thing. Otherwise it 
would have perished a thousand times over from so 
much resistance. Yes, because it pretends such foolish 
and impossible things, it would have had to fall soon by 
itself. But now all kingdoms and all races, which were 
against it, fall, and it remains above all and before all. 
Therefore there must be a divine power behind it, which 
keeps it against all devils, all kings, all wise men, all 
saints of the world, so that it will not fall. 





the Jews should henceforth take hold of it and (as he 
says here) learn that this Christ was sent by God; yet 
they do not. 

47) This is called by St. Paul [1 Tim. 3, 16] a great, 
godly mystery, which the world believed, no matter how 
hard it persecuted it at first; and it was preached to the 
Gentiles, no matter how horribly the devil fought it with 
his mighty ones. It also appeared to the angels, that is, 
in heaven it is manifest before the angels, and not so 
hidden in word and faith as in the world. It was also 
revealed in the flesh to the world, through Christ's own 
person and His apostles, who, though they had flesh and 
blood as other men, yet it was revealed to them. And is 
justified in the spirit; for though it is condemned and 
foolishness in the sight of reason, yet where there is spirit 
and faith, it is accepted and approved as the word and 
work of God. Summa, it fills heaven and earth, must and 
will be everywhere, with God, before the angels, in the 
saints, among men, in the world, on earth 2c. But it is 
called and remains a secret; therefore it is hidden from 
men in word and faith; only before God and the angels it 
is before the eyes and revealed. 

(48) Whoever does not want to know that Christ was 
sent by God will certainly have no excuse, and is worthy 
of being blinded and hardened. He has proven himself 
enough, and he has let it be known that he will weave his 
hand over the Gentiles in such a way that not only those 
who robbed them before, but still rob them every day, will 
go among them; and in short, that Christ has no friends 
but those he makes from his enemies. And where he 
should kill his enemies, he should also make no more 
Christians, and so would pluck out the wheat with the 
tares [Matth. 13, 29.]. Where would St. Paul be, if he 
should be strangled, since he was an enemy? So the 
110th Psalm, v. 1, sings of Christ's kingdom, that he shall 
reign among his enemies; and the 45th Psalm, v. 6, that 
the nations shall give themselves under him in the midst 
of the king's enemies. And here in Zechariah he speaks 
that he should be sent, not to the Jews or friends, but to 
the enemies, to the Gentiles. 


1820 Erl. 42, 184-186. interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 


2, 9-II. W. vi, 3364-3367. 1821 





The ones who rob him and their robbers, that his 
kingdom is of a different kind than the worldly kingdoms, 
and that all he does is to make friends out of joy, so that 
he receives all good things and suffers all evil from them. 

But the worldly kingdom makes enemies out of 
friends, so that it takes good and demands, and neither 
wants nor can suffer anything bad. For how would a 
worldly king remain if he should neither demand nor take 
anything from his subjects or friends, and should suffer 
all evil, punish nothing, let himself be fooled and fooled 
by everyone? It does not work, nor is it suitable in a 
worldly kingdom; therefore, since the Jews also wanted 
to have worldly kings, 1 Sam. 8, 11, he let them know 
what burdens and burdens they would have to bear, 
which they did not need before under the judges and 
prophets, since God Himself ruled through them. 
Follows: 


V. 10. Rejoice, and be glad, O daughter of Zion: for, 
behold, | come, and will dwell with thee, saith the 
LORD. 


50 This is an exhortation to them that are despised, and 
are under the cross, as the Jews were at that time, to 
confirm the next promise of Christ's mission. As if to say, 
"Since all these things are now present, and Jerusalem 
is to be restored for the sake of these great things, you 
should not be idle, sluggish, or unenthusiastic, as the 
unbelievers are, but should build and build with courage, 
freshness, and gladness, for the sake of the good and 
great hope of the goods to come under Christ's kingdom. 

51. "For | come and will dwell with you," that is, | will 
rule myself, and shall no longer be a worldly kingdom, 
but | myself will dwell with you spiritually, through the 
gospel and faith; all of which the Holy Spirit works, as St. 
Paul Eph. 3, 17 teaches that Christ dwells in us through 
faith; and Isaiah Cap. 66, 1 speaks that God does not 
dwell in earthly houses, as also St. Stephen Apost. 7, 49. 
But these are all spiritual and high words, since faith is 
necessary; that | poor man should believe that God 
dwells with me, and yet | am outwardly in the body of the 
devil and of all the world. 





| am a sinful man who falls many times and is frail, so 
that it is an incredible thing to be God's dwelling place 
here. 


V.11. And in that day shall many nations be brought 
unto the Lord, and shall be my people; and | will dwell 
with thee, that thou mayest know that the Lord of hosts 
hath sent me unto thee. 


52 Then he repeats again that he will dwell with the 
Jews, so that not only the Jews but also the Gentiles will 
be devoted to him, and become a nation of Jews and 
Gentiles, as if they were all Jews. So that the Jews would 
not think that he wanted to dwell only with them as Jews, 
as was said above [v. 10], he extends the same 
promised dwelling also to the Gentiles, and wants to 
dwell with the Jews, not only as Jews, but also as 
gathered together with the Gentiles, so that the Gentiles 
and the Jews will be one thing, and will sound alike. This 
miracle is greater than any other, and by it, as he himself 
says here, it should be evident that he was sent by God. 
For when one sees how the Gentiles and the Jews were 
so hostile to each other, it is impossible to believe that 
both should become more and more One People of God, 
and one must confess that it was a great miracle of God, 
so that the apostles and disciples themselves could not 
believe it for the first time, Apost. 8, 13. 14. 9, 21. 10, 25. 
11, 2. ff., and hardly came to it, that God had to give St. 
Peter a sign from heaven, Cap. 10, 10. ff., and the 
apostles held a great concilium about it, Cap. 15, 1. ff. 

(53) He also gives it to be understood that because 
the Gentiles are to become his people, Moses' law is to 
cease. For Moses was not given to the Gentiles, and yet 
they are to be given to the Lord himself, not to Moses, 
and to become the Lord's people, not Moses’ people, 
that he may dwell with them together with the Jews. For 
this dwelling place, which he repeats twice and includes 
the Gentiles, cannot be the physical dwelling place in the 
temple, but, as has been said, must be spiritual, since he 
also dwelt with them before without such a promise, and 
this new promise goes to another, new dwelling place. 


1822 Erl. 42, 186-188. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3367-3369. 


V. 12: And the Lord shall inherit Judah for his 
portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem 
again. 


(54) This is spoken in a proverb, and drawn from the 
physical inheritance to the spiritual, in this way: When all 
these things come to pass, that God makes Jews and 
Gentiles one people, and dwells with them, then it shall 
come to pass that the Lord shall possess Judah for an 
inheritance [Ps. 2:8], which hitherto has been so often 
spoken of, so often desired, and yet has not wanted to 
take place bodily. Then Jerusalem will be chosen rightly, 
so that from now on no one will be able to resist. Thus 
Christ says John 15:1: "| am a true vine," drawn from the 
physical vine to the spiritual. Item, so Zechariah will also 
say in the next chapter [Cap. 3, 10.]: "At that time one will 
invite the other under his fig tree", that is, in Christianity 
this will happen right at first, that one now does it bodily, 
and one invites the other as a guest. For he does this 
here, and says that it is to take place "in the holy land". 
For on the earthly land many unbelievers dwell and 
remain, who do not let it be a holy land, nor are they 
God's inheritance for his part. 


V. 13. Let all flesh be still before the Lord, for he has 
arisen from his holy place. 


55This is an admonition to all the world, that he may 
show how he has spoken here of such Judah and 
Jerusalem, which all the world has come to know.

has given "recht" by a noun: illa luetitiu, while vere should have been

goes. For if he meant the earthly land of Judah alone, 
what need was there for him to cry out to all the world to 
be silent before the Lord? The Jews alone should be 
silent, who would be alone before him. But now he 
speaks: "Let all flesh be silent before the Lord," as if the 
Lord were before all flesh. Now the opinion is that 
because God wants to do this in all the world, and dwell 
among Jews and Gentiles everywhere, everyone should 
be silent, that is, give room, let God rule and do it, Let 
no one oppose him, let no one resist him, and let no one 
think himself too wise, pious, powerful, nor rely on men, 
but let everyone let him rule, and confess himself a 
sinner, a poor, lost man before him, so that he may be 
helped. For this reason the Lord has gone to his holy 
place, that is, he has come forth and preached about 
himself and made it known to all the world that he alone 
will do all things, that he alone is able to do all things; as 
Christ says in Matth. 28:18: "All authority has been given 
to me in heaven and on earth. 

(56) And especially this little word "be silent" means 
to be silent, as those who speak and rumble with words 
are called silent, as Caleb called the people of Israel 
silent when they murmur, Numbers 13:31. This indicates 
that Christ alone reigns with the word, and he alone 
should speak, be heard, and be believed; false teachers, 
heretics, and those who want to be wise should keep 
their mouths shut before him and in his kingdom. Truly, 
a necessary admonition, but one that is little kept. For 
where Christ speaks in one place through one mouth, 
there the devil will also go, and with ten mouths he will 
wash and chat. His kingdom is in speaking; therefore he 
must suffer vain and much pleading, and is a perpetual 
wrangling with words and preaching.

The third chapter. 


V. 1. 2. And Joshua the high priest was shown to 
me, standing before the angel of the Lord. And Satan 
stood on his right hand to oppose him. [And the LORD 
said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan: yea, 
the LORD rebuke thee, that slew Jerusalem.] 


After the prophet has comforted and strengthened the 
people in general, and interpreted the same visions and 
consolations himself, pointing to Christ's future kingdom, 
he now begins to comfort the heads and rulers in 
particular, both spiritual and temporal. First, the spiritual 
head, in this chapter, together with its interpretation and 
interpretation of Christ. Then the secular head, in the 
following chapter. For where the heads are despondent 
and do not want to attack the work, what shall the people 
do? It is, they say, up to a good lifter, and a good lifter is 
worthy of all honor. Therefore, because the people are 
now admonished and awakened, they may say, "Well, 
we would like to do it, but who shall lift it up? Whom shall 
we follow? We must have a head to go with, so he gives 
them lifters and heads, Joshua the high priest and 
Zerubbabel the ruler of Judah, and treats them both with 
kindness, so that he may make them bold and fresh to 
go. 

(2) But he masterfully meets every thought that makes 
them despondent and unenthusiastic. Namely, the high 
priest, as a clergyman, because he sees that there is so 
much hindrance, thinks it is his and the people's sin, 
therefore God is not yet quite merciful to them. Prince 
Zerubbabel thinks that his worldly power is far too small 
to do anything against so many heathens. So they both 
stand grieved; the high priest by his evil conscience, the 
prince by stupidity of his inability. Therefore he takes 
away from both of them their stupid thoughts and shows 
how the high priest is pious and pleasing in the sight of 
God, and from where the prince Zerubbabel should have 
strength and power so that he is safe. Let us deal with 
the high priest first. 





3. "Joshua the high priest was shown to me," he says, 
"that is, | saw in one vision Joshua the high priest, what 
was wrong with him, so that | might preach it to him and 
to the people, how he should not take such a fault into 
account, but be bold and joyful, knowing that he had a 
gracious God. But this was his fault, that two thoughts 
oppressed him and made his conscience evil. The first 
was that Satan stood at his right hand and challenged 
him. This is nothing else, because the devil stood firm, 
and made his sin great, and his conscience stupid and 
despondent. For this is the devil's way, to magnify sin 
and make God's judgment terrible, as Revelation 12:10 
says, that the old dragon accuses the saints before God 
day and night. Just as the Holy Spirit is a comforter and 
advocate [Joh. 16, 7.], who excuses sin before God, 
makes it small and futile. 


The other thoughts follow from the fact that he thinks 
his priesthood and work is unpleasant before God. He 
shows that his clothes, that is, the priestly clothes, were 
unclean or not glorious. For the prophet did not see 
Joshua as acommon man, but as a high priest in priestly 
garments, which were to be beautiful and glorious, as 
God commanded Moses, Ex. 28:4, to make Aaron 
ornaments and glorious garments for the priesthood. 
Therefore, even among the papists, the vestments or 
church clothes are called regalia, that is, ornaments. So 
Joshua had priestly garments on, but they were unclean; 
not of filth or sullied, but that they were not beautiful nor 
adorned as befitted, but were old or worn, or of common 
cloth, like other daily garments. All this is called unclean 
and unholy, because it is not according to God's word, 
who commanded that they should be beautiful garments. 


5 Because therefore his garments are not righteous, 
it is signified by this that his conscience is before 


1826 En. 42, 190-192. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3373-3376. 


1827 





Even though he considered himself a priest of God, born 
of priestly stock (which he could not deny), he was not 
happy and beautiful, that is, he did not consider himself 
righteous, beautiful, nor worthy enough to do pleasant 
service before God. Therefore he must be seen in 
shabby, evil clothes, like a poor village priest in a shabby 
and shabby chasuble, so that the sum and opinion is 
this: the high priest Joshua had such thoughts, and his 
conscience gave him such words: Well, | am born a high 
priest, according to God's order; but, dear God, we have 
sinned, that God has let the priesthood be destroyed by 
the Babylonians, so that there is little hope, and truly a 
wretched priesthood, which has almost shriveled up and 
the moths have eaten it; if it is to come forth again and 
become glorious, it will still be bad. It will take a lot of 
sunshine, it is a shabby thing, and vain rags. 

(6) For so naturally does the conscience, when it is 
evil and bitten with sins, that it cannot adorn itself at all, 
that is, it cannot be cheerful, nor have good cheer toward 
God, but always fears that its works count for nothing; or 
even hangs in doubt, that it cannot cheerfully say: | know 
that my work pleases God 2c. That such an 
interpretation is right, | have David as a witness, who 
himself points to the beautiful clothes of a righteously 
happy conscience, since he says Ps. 132, 9: "Let your 
priests put on righteousness, and your consecrated put 
on gladness"; and Solomon Eccles. 9, 7. 8: "Let your 
clothes always be white, for your works please God"; 
and Christ Matth. 6, 17: "When you fast, anoint your 
head" 2c., that thus adornment indicates a cheerful good 
conscience before God, which is sure its works please 
God. Again, rags and shod clothes mean an evil, 
despondent conscience. 

7 Against such two pieces of comfort, the angel of the 
Lord is also seen with two pieces. The first is that he 
scolds Satan with words, saying, "The LORD 


1) Thus the Jenaer and Walch; Wittenberger and Erlanger: it. 





rebuke you, you Satan" 2c. As if to say: O Joshua, | see 
that you are stupid, and have a bad conscience, as a 
poor sinner; but behold, | come with a comforting 
sermon, for | have seen an angel scolding Satan for 
God's sake, and speaking your best. Therefore be of 
good cheer, and know that it is not your sins that make 
you so foolish, but the devil thus challenges you, and 
makes your conscience so evil, and wants to hinder this 
building. Be of good cheer therefore, fear not; God is 
gracious to thee, and begin to build, that the people may 
follow thee. 

(8) And here let us learn what is meant by Satan 
standing at his right hand. Satan, in Hebrew, means an 
adversary, as he himself indicates and says, "Satan 
stood at his right hand to resist him. For this is the devil's 
way, that he resists God and all his own; as also John 1 
Ep. 4, 3. calls the Antichrist, that is, the Counter-Christ; 
and Paul 2 Thess. 2, 4. calls him the Resistant One, thus 
rendering the Hebrew word Satan in Greek Antikimenon 
[avragipeuov], for it is commonly called Satan. 
means all the repulsive ones; but here it certainly means 
the devil himself. 

9. he standeth, saith he, neither lieth down nor sitteth. 
For the devil is in earnest, and verily treadeth upon his 
feet, and is stiffnecked, and feeleth not, and is not fallen 
to destroy and to hurt, as also Peter saith 1 Ep. 5:8: "Your 
adversary (that is, your Satan) prowleth about like a 
fierce lion." This is also felt in the conscience, because 
he begins to press and to make sin great, how utterly 
despondent and stupid a man becomes, especially 
before God; like him, how stiffly and firmly he holds those 
whom he has caught in error and heresy, how they will 
not yield, nor let him tell them. 

(10) But he especially loves to stand on the right 
hand, that is, in the best and spiritual things; that is, he 
resists most of all that right faith and a good conscience 
should not arise, but that vain unbelief or doubt and 
despondency should remain, just as the 109th Psalm, v. 
6, says of the Jews, Satan stands on their right hand; for 
there is no angel to rebuke Satan. Therefore it is not 
possible that they should cease from unbelief; Satan 


1828 Erl. 42, 19L-1SS. Interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 3, 1. 2. W. VI, 3376-3379. 


1829 





He stands too stiffly and too firmly, just as in all herds 
and heretics. But here, in Joshua, he would also like to 
stand on the right side and resist the faith, but there is a 
stronger one, who tells him to triumph and give room to 
the faith. Blessed is he who is worthy of such a thing. 

The other part is that he does it with a deed or sign, 
and it is called stripping Joshua of his rags and putting 
on glorious garments. As if Zechariah were to say, "Dear 
Joshua, you think the priesthood does not apply and you 
are stupid; but | have seen that you are well off with God 
and that your priesthood is pleasant. 

(12) These are excellent, great words and visions. 
How great a man must Joshua have been in the sight of 
God, to have such glorious words and visions ordered by 
God for his sake. Should it not give him joy and courage 
when he hears how God acts on his behalf and lets his 
angel see him and fight with the devil over him, 
proclaiming to him forgiveness of sins and that he has a 
gracious God? 

(13) Yes, what good would it have done him if he had 
not believed? And how could he have done greater sin 
than to dishonor and doubt God? If one looks at 
Zechariah alone, who preaches such things, it seems as 
if he is pretending to the high priest. But what a 
necessary hypocrisy it would have been, because good 
Joshua is so low and despondent before his eyes. It 
would be much more hypocrisy, because the pope is 
called an earthly god, and a mixed person of God and 
man. 

14 Here Joshua is miserable and nothing; therefore 
God, who looks upon the vile and miserable, also makes 
him so glorious, according to the saying of Mary [Luc. 
1:52]: "He pushes down the mighty from their seats, and 
exalts the lowly." So now Joshua is strengthened, both 
with words and signs, as the Scriptures use. The word is 
when Satan is scolded. The sign is that he is stripped of 
his rags and clothed in glorious garments. Let us now 
see the text 

(15) Again, he shows how there is more than One 
Person in the Godhead. For Zechariah speaks first of all 
how Joshua was before the angel. 





of the Lord, and immediately afterwards he says that the 
Lord scolded Satan, as if he meant that the Lord himself 
was like the angel. For he says nothing of the Lord, that 
he was there, but an angel, and yet he says that the Lord 
speaks; just as Abraham worships the Lord in the person 
of an angel in Genesis 18:2, 3, and speaks with him. For 
take heed to the words as they follow one another; thus 
he says, Joshua stood before the angel of the Lord, and 
the Lord said to Satan, The Lord rebuke thee 2c. If the 
angel was not the Lord himself, the text would have been 
better: Joshua stood before the angel of the LORD, and 
the angel said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee 2c. 
(16) Also in this way one Lord speaks of another, as one 
God speaks of another (for Lord is here, in both places, 
also the one right name of the right natural God), as if | 
thus said: And God said to Satan: God rebuke thee 2c. 
Here it would be understood that one God speaks of the 
other God, like Ps. 45, 8: "Therefore, God, your God has 
anointed you." From which Psalm the Epistle to the 
Hebrews Cap. 1, 8. 9. proves that Christ is God; and this 
speech is the same: God speaks to Satan, God 
reproaches you. There is also the whole speech. For 
Joshua stands before the angel with Satan, as before 
God, that all this happens and is considered as before 
God's face, in conscience, as [§ 3] is said. And the angel 
also gives to the others who stand before him, that is, the 
angels, as one God, that they should clothe Joshua. That 
Christ, however, is indicated here, that he is God, and an 
angel into the world in the future. 

17 This rebuke of the Lord is also spoken in the 
Scriptural way, which testifies that God does and creates 
all things by His word, as the 33rd Psalm, v. 9, says: "He 
speaks, and it is done. So, when GOD speaks, it is so 
much, he does and creates something. When he blesses 
(that is, when he speaks well and favorably), he does 
good, helps and makes great, as in the Old Testament 
the goods and temporal possessions of GOD are called 
blessings [Deut. 28, 2. ff.]. Again, when he curses, he 
corrupts and destroys, Deut. 28, 16. ff., therefore curse 
means: destruction of goods, as Malachia says 


1830 Eri. 4s, is5-ig7. Interpretations on the Prophets. W. vi, 3379-3331. 


1831 





Cap. 2, 2: "I will curse your blessings", that is, | will make 
your goods less, which you have through my blessings. 
So we must also get used to this divine speech, that 
God's rebuke is as much as to ward off and deter the 
devil, so that he must leave his intentions in the hands 
of God, as the 9. 1) Psalm, v. 6, says: "When you rebuke 
the nations, the wicked perished. St. Paul Rom. 16, 20. 
speaks of the same rebuke of God in other words: "God 
will soon tread Satan under your feet"; the trampling is 
as much as the rebuke, although St. Paul also uses the 
word "trample" in other passages of Scripture that give 
the same. 

018 And he added, Yea, the LORD reproach thee, 
which hath chosen Jerusalem, to comfort Joshua and 
the people the more, because they heard that the devil 
was reproached for the very thing that was against them, 
even for Jerusalem, which they should build, and that 
they should henceforth be unhindered of the devil, and 
of all that was against them. For God has chosen 
Jerusalem to dwell there, and will build it, and will no 
longer allow the devil to hinder it. Such manifold great 
comforts indicate that without a doubt the people and 
their leaders were almost very stupid, frightened and 
misguided, and suffered great hindrances and 
temptations. For where God comforts strongly, there 
must indeed be strong persecution. He does not give his 
word and comfort so lightly or without need; he holds 
himself and his word dear, as is also just and right. 
Therefore there has been great misery and distress 
here, as follows: 


V. 2-5. Is not this one a burn saved from the fire? 
[And Joshua had unclean garments on 2c.] 

(19) This much is said: Is it not enough that God has 
destroyed the whole Jewish people, as if a whole city 
were burned out? And thou Satan wilt leave nothing, not 
even a fire or a flame? Not so, but you shall depart, and 


1) In the original and in the German editions: "the 10th Psalm". 
Only the Latin translation has correctly: 9. ?8ulmii8. 





Let this Joshua remain a remaining piece, so that the 
whole Jewish kingdom may be established again. 

020 And there we see how wretched things were 
about the Jews in those days, and how all things were 
of no account that any thing should be made of their 
building. For he compares the high priest to a remaining 
fire, which is honestly kept and torn out. If a house or a 
city burns, what is such a fire 2) compared to a house or 
a city? Who can hope that a house will be built from a 
fire? It is not possible nor humanly conceivable. The 
Jews, and Joshua in particular, felt the same way, 
thinking, "What shall we do? Shall we build? For we are 
as a fire to the former city of Jerusalem, to a goodly 
house that is burned; and we are as nothing to them that 
were before in that city, which are all destroyed and 
perished with the city: but we are left as coals and 
buntings. See now if it has not been necessary to 
comfort abundantly and to pretend well in such distress. 

21. but the Scripture has its way of speaking of God 
in this way, that He makes everything out of that which 
is nothing or little [Rom. 4, 17.], and if He disturbs, that 
He nevertheless leaves something and keeps seed, so 
that He starts it up again. Thus he caused the world to 
be destroyed by the flood of sin, together with men and 
animals [Gen. 7:21, 22], and made it again by eight men 
and a pair of animals of every kind, which were the seed, 
Cap. 8:16 ff, item, thus he speaks Isa. 1, 9.: "If God did 
not keep us seed, we would be like Sodom and 
Gomorrah"; and again Cap. 10, 22.: "When the children 
of Israel shall be as much as the sand of the sea, then 
shall the remnant be saved"; item, Jer. 10, 23. [Kagl. 3, 
22.]: "It is God's grace that we have not perished"; item, 
Is. 49, 5. He says: Christ shall convert the fagots or the 
yeasts of Israel; and Is. 65, 8. He says that He will make 
Israel again out of one kernel of wine. 


2) That is, an extinguishing fire that only smokes a little. Isa. 7, 4. 


1832 Erl. 42, 197-199. interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 


3, 2-7. W. VI, 3382-3384. 1833 





22 Therefore he that can make out of the branches 
wine, and out of the kernel vineyards, and out of the corn 
fields full of seed, and whatsoever more he hath in the 
scriptures, can build again out of the residue of the fire a 
whole city. He proved it before, and from one Adam he 
made all men on earth, from one Jacob the whole 
Israelite nation, and daily from one cherry or nut kernel 
so many trees that from year to year one kernel would 
give enough cherry trees and cherries for all the world, if 
one wanted to produce them. So also in all other things, 
he makes abundance out of scarcity, wealth out of 
poverty, honor out of shame, 1) life out of death, 
everything out of nothing. 

23 Therefore this is said for the comfort of Joshua, 
that he should hear how he is a fire plucked out of the 
fire, and kept for this purpose, that a great and glorious 
city should be built of him, not by his own power, but by 
him that is able to make of one grain a year an hundred; 
the next year, out of the hundreds ten thousand; the third 
year, an hundred times ten thousand; and so on, filling 
the world; and so making it daily. Therefore this word is 
not to Satan alone, but rather to Joshua, that he should 
not look upon himself as a leftover, poor burnt of fire, but 
as he was kept by God to be a seed, nucleus and root to 
raise up the whole city more glorious than it was before. 
And though the devil be sorry, yet shall he not hinder it. 
Therefore, my dear Joshua, do not look at yourself as a 
small piece of short stocking and a wretched blight before 
your eyes. It is God who wills and is able to make beams, 
pillars, rafters, houses, cities, forests and all things out of 
the fire; and you are ordained by God to build the glorious 
Jerusalem through you and out of you, no matter how 
small you may be. 

(24) From this example we learn, first of all, how 
difficult it is to make a good, confident conscience, and 
how sour it is to do what God commands, and to whom 
He commands it. 


1) In the original: "aus Ehren Schande", which is obviously either a 
typographical or a printing error. Only the Latin Wittenberg edition and 
Walch have improved this error. 


Work calls. 2) Truly in Joshua there is no pride, nor 
ambition, nor thirst, but only fear, trembling, and humility. 
But the reckless spirits and enthusiasts go along: if only 
a thought occurs to them to teach or do something, it 
must be the Holy Spirit. Your Joshua can hardly instill the 
Spirit with single drops; and these drink it into themselves 
with whole buckets. But God's work always begins so 
sickly and weakly, but increases confidently; again, the 
spirits, as swiftly as they run and hurry, so soon they also 
sink again, and subside. 

25 Secondly, the doctrine of grace against works is 
confirmed here. For here Joshua is taken off and put on 
before he is given the office and commandment of what 
he is to do. The person must first be pure and beautiful 
through faith, after which his works are pleasing, as is 
also shown in Habet and Cain [Genesis 4:5]. Follows: 


V. 6, 7: And the angel of the LORD testified unto 
Joshua, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, If thou 
wilt walk in my ways, and keep my charge, then thou 
shalt also judge my house, and keep my courts: and | 
will give thee to walk among these that stand here. 


(26) According to the way of the law, he commands 
Joshua what he should do, and does not place the 
promise freely on God's goodness, but on Joshua's 
obedience. For this is the difference between the Old and 
New Testament, that the promises of the Old Testament 
do not extend further than as far as the people would be 
pious and obedient. Therefore all such promises go in 
this way: If thou wilt do this, it shall be done; if thou wilt 
be obedient, | will do thee good. All with attached 
obligation, difference and condition. But the promises of 
the New Testament come quite freely out of pure 
goodness, and without the addition of any obligation they 
read thus: These things will | do (saith the Lord); these 
things shall be done (saith the Lord). Sometimes he 
adds: Not for your sake, 


2) The last sentence has been given by the Latin translator thus: 6t 
quarn NiMeultor ni Uivinum opns voenti n666cknniu8 “and How hard 
it becomes for us to go to God's work when we are called to it). 


1834 Erl. 42, 19S-SOL 


Interpretations on the Prophets. W. vr, 3384-3387. 


1835 





but for my name's sake | will do it. St. Paul wrote enough 
about this to the Romans and Galatians. 

27 Thus, because Joshua is still to lead the old 
priesthood, he relies on his obedience, which he 
promises him. In this way, he again prevents Joshua from 
becoming too proud through the previous visions, 
consolations and promises, as if God had to do it and was 
captivated by such promises, but must remain humble 
and walk in the fear of God. 

For we are such poor people on earth: when God 
punishes us and lets us go badly, we become too 
despondent and fainthearted that he has enough to 
comfort and lift us up. Again, when He comforts us and 
makes us feel good, we become too proud and sure that 
He has enough to afflict and frighten us. Our flesh is far 
too weak and frail to bear God's work, both evil and good. 
Evil and good. As he does with us, so he gains. We 
cannot bear evil, we cannot bear good. So now, after 
such great comforts, he must again humble Joshua and 
keep him in check, so that he will not overreach himself 
with such a glorious promise. Saul and many kings 
deceived Israel that they had God's promise, and 
became proud that they perished, and of course brought 
the Jews all at once into the Babylonian prison, because 
they relied on God, and still did not want to be pious, but 
wanted to live safely and without fear; again, many 
deceived the miserable prison that they remained 
outside, and did not come back from Babylon. Oh who 
could realize how we poor people are before God! 

29. the word "testify" is in Scripture as much as to 
proclaim God's word, Ps. 122:4: "When the tribes go up 
to testify to Israel"; that is, God's people come up to the 
temple, when God's word is proclaimed to Israel; and Ps. 
81:9: "Hear, my people, | will testify to you"; therefore 
God's word is called testimony, because God speaks 
through men, who are His witnesses to the people, Acts} 
1:8. 1:8: "Ye are my witnesses." And what is witnessed is| 
not seen, but only heard, and must be believed. 








God's word, spoken through angels or men, that 
demands faith. 

(30) Now the saying, "Will you walk in my ways?" is 
almost common to us, that God's ways are called God's 
commandments and works; and to walk in them is to 
practice God's commandments and works, and to be 
obedient in them. About this he gave Joshua a special 
command: he was to wait on his guard, as Moses also 
said in the second and third books [Cap. 8, 35]. The guard 
is what we call waiting on the church and God's service. 
For there one does not have to do with men, but waits 
and cares for the Lord, and pays attention to him alone, 
what he says and wants. Such respect and waiting is 
called the guard of the Lord, or waiting for the Lord, which 
was especially due to Joshua as high priest. 

31 Therefore, the first promise of such a duty is that 
Joshua shall judge God's house in peace and keep His 
courts, that is, he shall not be confirmed by men but by 
God Himself in his office, so that he may know how God 
has commanded him and be sure that he pleases God in 
such an office, because he accepts it not by his own 
choice nor by presumption but by God's command. For 
this purpose, he will give him peace and space, so that 
he may lead such an office, that is, the city shall again 
come into being and be protected by God. For if this were 
not the case, how could he take care of his office inside? 
This means to judge God's house, that is, to be judge and 
governor over the state where God's word and God's 
service is within, that is, in the priesthood of Levi, and in 
the spiritual state. And is indeed a high, glorious 
command, who is commanded to govern God's word, 
God's service, and the souls, and is set to be the pope in 
Judaism. He also includes the courts with the house of 
God, so that not only in the temple, but also in the courts, 
God's word and God's service go. 

32 The other promise is that he will give him obedient 
subjects; for where there is authority without obedience, 
there is disorder and nothing of value. And Joshua is also 
in need. For the Jewish people were a haughty, stiff- 
necked people, so that 


1836 Erl. 42, 201-204. interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 3, 6-8. 


Joshua might be anxious, saying, Thou commandest me 
the spiritual government in these miserable times: how 
if it were so with me, that the rest believed not, and 
would every man boast that it was commanded him? 
Moses and Aaron could not receive it: Korah and the 
best of the tribe of Levi rose up against them [Num. 16:1 
ff], how much more shall it be so with me, who am much 
less than Moses and Aaron? 

033 Then the promise goes, saying, Fear not: | also, 
which command thee the ministry, will give thee 
subjects, which shall follow thee, and shall not rise up 
against thee, nor rebel against thee. For | will have my 
angels with thee, which shall see that they keep thee in 
rule, and them in obedience. This is what he says here: 
"And | will give you those who will walk (that is, who will 
be obedient) between or among these who are standing 
here" (that is, among the angels), who will stand there to 
wait for you and keep the people to you against all the 
devils and their rebellious angels. You can be sure of 
this. 

34) From this saying we have that the grace and gift 
of God is vain where there are devout, obedient 
subjects, and that God provides and maintains this in the 
world through His angels, against the rebellion and 
disobedience that is in all men's hearts and is stirred up 
by the devil, that there is no doubt where there is 
disobedience and rebellion, that the devil has loosed the 
bridle 1) and the angels refrain from guarding, so that 
God may punish those who deserve it. Just as in 
German lands the next uprising was undoubtedly also a 
punishment on us who despised his gospel and did not 
want to obey his word. Although by such punishment we 
have only become the more angry, as the wicked are 
wont to do, as Isaiah says Cap. 9, 13: "The people turn 
not to him that smiteth them." 

35 Again, it is also grace and goodness where he 
establishes and gives authority, especially when they 
are Joshua, that is, pious and useful; as also here the 
text teaches, and also Solomon in his Proverbs says 
Cap. 20, 12.: "An ear that hears, and an eye that sees, 
the

W. vr, 3387-33M. 1837 


the Lord makes them both. The seeing eye is the pious 
authority, the hearing ear is the pious subjects. Neither 
is in man's power, God must give it both. 


V. 8. Listen, Joshua, you high priest, you and your 
friends who dwell before you, for they are vain 
wonders. Behold, | will send for my servant Zemah. 


This text speaks of Christ's future; for the prophet 
links the Levitical priesthood to the future priesthood of 
Christ, to which it is also directed, and to which it should 
have an end, as we have just heard. And the prophet 
himself teaches what Joshua's priesthood means, so 
that no one should seek any other allegory or 
interpretation here. For so far he has said enough about 
the priesthood of Joshua, how it was his turn with God, 
what he should do, what God wanted to do to him again, 
that nothing more was necessary to teach. Therefore he 
now proclaimed what would follow after all this, and how 
long Joshua's priesthood and ministry would continue, 
saying: "Listen, Joshua, with your friends, | will proclaim 
to you even more and something greater. 

37. but he takes the friends of Joshua, who are also 
to hear this, so that he may understand that the promise 
of the future kingdom of Christ is only for the benefit of 
the pious and faithful, who are like Joshua and of one 
spirit with him. For many of the Jewish people have 
despised this promise and its fulfillment, and still despise 
it to this day, and remain with Joshua and his friends 
alone. 

(38) And he calls them "vain wonders. For all those 
who receive Christ are strange things and wonders in the 
sight of the world. For it is such an annoying, foolish and 
wretched thing about Christ's kingdom on earth that all 
who believe in him are considered vain fools and 
wretched people, as Paul also says [1 Cor. 4, 9.]: "We 
are a spectacle to God, angels and men." In the same 
way also Isaiah Cap. 8, 18. 14. speaks: "Behold, these 
are my children, whom GOD giveth me for a sign and for 
a wonder, and for a fall and for an offense unto both 
houses of Israel. "2c. "Christ is an offense to the Jews 
and a foolishness to the Gentiles, 


1838 Erl. 4S, S04-LOS. Interpretations on the prophets. 


1 Cor. 1, 23. So also, whoever preaches and confesses 
Christ must also be an offense and a fall to the highly 
intelligent, prudent and holy. 

(39) Now here the angel thinks that this promise of 
Christ is so vexatious that his friends who want to hear it 
with him must be considered fools and strange, strange 
people by the other Jews and the whole world. Therefore 
it is necessary that they be admonished to listen, as if he 
were to Say, "Listen, listen, dear Joshua, along with your 
friends, it is necessary to listen and to pay attention to 
the word and to stick to it. If you do not keep the word, 
you cannot stand before the trouble that Christ's 
kingdom brings. 

40 From all this Joshua must learn that he should 
build the temporal temple and keep its office, but not 
cling to it as if there were nothing left, but know that it will 
last for a short time and another will come. And it is a 
wonder that such a thing is commanded to be built with 
such earnestness; and yet it shall be nothing to the 
servant that is to come. Joshua knows that he is the high 
priest, and he must believe that this Zemah will be 
greater and more glorious than he and his descendants. 
Therefore he understands that another high priest will 
come and abolish his Levitical priesthood. 

41 He says, "My servant Zemah," just as if he had 
no other servant, or as if the others were not his 
servants. But Christ in particular, above all others, is 
called God's servant, as Isaiah used to call him before 
other prophets, as Isa. 52, 13: "Behold, my servant will 
drive wisely," and Cap. 42, 1: "Behold, this is my 


servant", which the evangelists interpret puor meus, 


as Matth. 12,-18. and Apost. 4, 27: "They are come 
together against thy child JEsum, whom thou hast 
anointed" 2c. For this servant should do the right work, 
since all other servants have prophesied about it, as he 
himself often praises in the Gospel of John [Cap. 4, 34. 
5, 36.] the work which the Father commanded him to do, 
namely to redeem the world through his suffering 2c. 
Therefore, he is the right and only servant of God, the 
exemplar above all other servants. 





W. VI, 3390-3392. 1839 


42. but he calls him Zemah [XXX], which means in 
German a plant, like a branch, rice or rue grows; as also 
Isaiah Cap. 4:2: "In that day shall the plant of the LORD 
be glorious"; and Jer. 33:15: "In that day will | cause to 
grow of David a plant of righteousness" 2c. And 
therefore it is called a plant, that Christ is preached 
without ceasing through the gospel, and grows and 
increases in the world; for his kingdom is growing and 
increasing until the last day, and is always bringing new 
and more Christians out of the world. 

(43) But there is a strange growth, which in the sight 
of the world seems like withering and destruction, 
because there is the cross of Christ with all kinds of 
persecution; yet there is also a vain growth. In the midst 
of death there is life, in poverty riches, in disgrace honor, 
and so on, under all adversity vain glory. Therefore 
Isaiah Cap. 53, 2. says: "He arises before Him as a rice, 
and as a root out of dry earth before Him"; that is, before 
God and in the spirit there is vain growth, and yet it 
comes out of dry earth, where there is neither moisture 
nor sap, that is, out of vain misery, distress and sorrow 
before the world. So also here Christ is not called bad 
Zemah or growth, but a growth of the Lord. For he is the 
Lord's servant in such growth; not a plant in the sight of 
the world, because it is fat and wet land, that is, good, 
honor and pleasure. 


V. 9 For behold, on the one stone that | lay before 
the face of Joshua are seven eyes. 


44 Here the prophet himself gives the allegory or 
interpretation of the physical temple, and speaks of a 
spiritual building of a living temple, in which a much 
different stone is to be laid as a foundation than in that 
one. It shall be a few stones, but in the physical temple 
many stones are laid. This stone is, since Isaiah Cap. 
28, 16. and Peter 1 Ep. 2, 6. of say, "Behold, I lay in Zion 
a cornerstone, a precious, tried stone 2c., he that 
trusteth in him shall not be put to shame." The stone is 
Christ, as He interprets Himself Matth. 21, 42: "The 
stone which the builders rejected has become the 
cornerstone." And God lays the same stone Himself, not 
Joshua. 


1840 Erl. 4S, SU6-SO08. Interpretation of Zechariah (1.), cap. 3, 9. W. VI, 3392-3395. 


1841 





nor Zerubbabel; for God builds this temple Himself, as 
He says here, "The stone | lay before the face of 
Joshua." For God already began to build the spiritual 
temple, because He had the physical temple built for the 
sake of the spiritual one. And over this is such a spiritual 
building before the face of Joshua, that is, before the eye 
of the priesthood of Joshua. Christ's temple and 
kingdom began while Joshua's tribe and priesthood 
were still standing. This indicates that Christ was to 
come before Joshua and his tribe and priesthood 
perished. That therefore with Joshua's descendants this 
stone was laid before their eyes; although they neither 
saw nor understood it, even rejected it 1). 

45 There shall be seven eyes on this stone. A strange 
building, there stones are built on stones; here eyes are 
built on the one stone. Who can guess how this can 
happen and exist? Why not just as many seven ears, or 
seven mouths? The kingdom of Christ is based on faith 
and the knowledge of Christ, as Isaiah, Peter and Paul 
teach. For he that knoweth Christ is enlightened, and 
hath spiritual eyes. Now not all who hear about him 
recognize him, but only those who believe. Therefore not 
ears, but all things must be built upon this stone. So then 
the seven eyes are all true Christians who are 
enlightened by the Holy Spirit, especially those who 
teach, instruct and guide others. 

46 It is well known that the seventh number in the 
Scriptures is considered as a common number, or as all 
kinds, so that the seven eyes are all Christians. Besides 
this, it is said that in Judaism there should be no eye, but 
blindness; indeed, blindness should be everywhere that 
is not in Christ. For on this stone are all eyes, and 
nowhere else. And eyes are called eyes, because a 
Christian knows and sees and recognizes all things, as 
Paul says in 1 Cor. 2, 10: "The spirit also searches the 
depths of the Godhead"; and v. 15: "A spiritual man 
judges all things." For he knows what GOD, Christ, 
Spirit, life, righteousness, sin, death, hell, teu-. 


1) "him" is missing in the Erlanger. 


The world, the flesh, the future and the present; the eye 
and the knowledge are with him. 


Behold, | will hew him out, saith the LORD of hosts. 


This stone is not polished by the stonecutters, but 
also by God Himself. |, 1, He says, will dress, polish and 
carve the stone for Me, so that [it] will be a beautiful, fine, 
well-crafted stone. Some interpret this polishing to mean 
that Christ was prepared in his mother's womb by the 
Holy Spirit with various beautiful gifts. | leave them to it, 
but | consider that he is speaking of the passion of 
Christ, by which Christ was prepared and made ready to 
be the cornerstone of all who believe in him and are to 
be built on him. For thus he says Luc. 24, 26: "Did not 
Christ have to suffer these things and thus enter into his 
glory?" and the epistle to the Hebrews [Cap. 2, 10] says: 
"He was made perfect through suffering to be a duke of 
our salvation, and through suffering was crowned with 
honor and praise 2c. But the Jews and Pilate were our 
God's chisels, stone axes and tapping irons, which he 
used to polish this stone, to lay such a foundation for the 
new temple. For the seven eyes and all Christians came 
by his suffering and from his blood, and also built 
themselves on his suffering. The following text also 
proves all this: 


And will take away the sin of the same land for One 
Day. 

(48) For this purpose this stone is to be polished, so 
that sins may be taken away. Now sin is not taken away 
by anything except the suffering of Christ, as we well 
know. For this is also the power and fruit of His suffering, 
namely the forgiveness of sins, as Isaiah Cap. 53, 14, 
and Peter and Paul teach in many places [Rom. 4, 25]. 
Therefore, such suffering must be his suffering, and not 
his birth or conception. But because he promises to take 
away the sin of the land, he indicates that through the 
old priesthood no sins can be forgiven; indeed, that 
everything that is not Christ's suffering may not be 
forgiven. 


1842 En. 42, 208-211. interpretations on the prophets. w. VI, 3395-3397. 


1843 





sin, and all good works are unfit and sinful before God. It 
must be done by the polished cornerstone, and nothing 
else. 

49. How strong and powerful this forgiveness is, he 

gives to understand that he speaks, he wants to do it in 
one day; that is so much said: He wants to make such a 
great reconciliation and forgiveness in one day, which 
should be enough for all sin, from the beginning of the 
world to eternity, and should not have to make new 
forgiveness for new sins daily and yearly, as happened 
in the old priesthood, where forgiveness of sins was 
sought daily and yearly with sacrifices and worship; but 
the one polishing on the day of Christ's suffering should 
work acomplete, sufficient forgiveness. The epistle to the 
Hebrews also teaches how Christ perfected the saints 
with one sacrifice [Heb. 10:14]. 
50 But that he speaks of "the same land" means that he 
wants to take away the sin of the Jewish land. For the 
promise of Christ was made to the Jews; so they also 
had the law and the priesthood, in which atonement was 
made for sins. As if to say, "It is a great trouble to this 
land and people to take away sin daily and yearly, but 
they will not do it. Therefore | will take one day before 
me, and put away sin altogether, that such a being and 
labor may no longer be necessary. And so with this word 
the old testament and priesthood is reproved and 
abolished, as being incapable of taking away sin, and 
shall stand alone until the day when sin shall be taken 
away. 

51 Now behold, whether Joshua's friends be not vain 
marvels, that they should suffer such vexation. First, that 
there is another temple, and the fleshly temple is not 
enough; second, that the other temple should be so 
strange that it should have a single stone, and vain eyes 
built upon it; third, that their priesthood is unfit, and that 
there is vile sin in what they do, as if no sin were ever 
forgiven in and under their priesthood, but all these things 
should come to pass when this new temple is built, and 
their priesthood and temple are taken away. Vain 
vexation, vain vexation is this. 





V. 10. At that time (says the LORD of hosts) one 
shall invite another under the vine and under the fig 


tree. 


52) That is, when sin is gone, and God is reconciled 
through Christ, then true and eternal peace will come; as 
Paul teaches Rom. 5, 1. For where there is sin, there 
cannot be peace in the heart before God, as Isaiah says 
[Cap. 48, 22. 57, 21.]: "The wicked has no peace," and 
Isa. 59, 8.: 1) "They do not know the way of peace. For 
this is spoken proverbially, one shall invite another under 
the vine, to show peace in the land; for where it is so in 
the land, that men dwell safely, and invite one another to 
guest, and are merry, and drink, and eat, there is good 
peace. Therefore also the scripture says of the great 
peace under king Solomon, that every man dwelt under 
his fig tree and under his vine [1 Kings 4:25]. But when 
there is war, one must go out and lie down in the field; no 
one is safe nor sure of his own. 

(53) So now he will say: Until now, when sin has 
remained, everyone has sought peace, but sin has not 
wanted it. It has been more desired peace than peace 
that has existed. But now that sin is gone, there shall be 
complete peace. Let every man sit under his own vine, 
and let every man invite his neighbor to his table. 

(54) Not that Christ gives peace in the flesh (as the 
world does), that His own should be gathered together 
under vines and fig trees, but that the prophet needs to 
praise such a speech for spiritual peace, which the Jews 
needed for peace in the flesh; as if one said of the 
cleansing of the law of Moses, "The cleansing will come 
when Christ comes; item, one will eat the right paschal 
lamb once when Christ comes, and the like. For such 
forgiveness of sins as is here spoken of, and the peace 
that follows, cannot be understood from the Old 
Testament, as has been heard, because it deals daily and 
yearly with the forgiveness of sins. But here it is to be 
done in one day.

the 14th Psalm as part of the third verse. Cf. St. Louis edition, vol. IV,

W. VI, 3398-3401. 1845 





The fourth chapter. 


V.1-3. And the angel that talked with me came 
again, and awoke me, as one is awakened from sleep. 
And said unto me, What seest thou? And | said: | look, 
and behold, there is a candlestick all of gold, with a 
mantle on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it, and 
seven and seven ladles for the lamps that are on the 
top of it, and two olive trees by it, one on the right hand 
of the mantle, and the other on its left. 

(1) Now here he wants to comfort the other head, the 
prince Zerubbabel, who was also challenged with two 
thoughts, that he should be easy and stupid to build, as 
itis said above [Cap. 3, § 2]. The first is that he sees his 
inability and his strength, which is nothing compared to 
the power of the Persians and all the enemies. The other 
is that he sees how the enemies have so far succeeded 
in resisting the construction and have not wanted to 
continue what they have undertaken. Against these two 
challenges, the prophet comforts him and tells him not to 
look at his own inability, but at God's ability. For what is 
impossible with men is all possible with God [Luc. |, 37], 
and should also consider how the great kingdom of the 
Persians is nothing at all compared to God, who wants 
to do it. For though it is a great mountain before the 
world, yet before God it is no mountain, but a plain like 
other flat fields. For before Him there is nothing great, 
high, broad, mighty, wise, pious, blessed, or anything 
else, but all nothing. 

2 Thus the prophet preaches that he has seen a 
vision like a golden lampstand standing between two 
olive trees, and he himself interprets and adds the word, 
saying that it is the Spirit of God who wants to be among 
them and strengthen and help both Zerubbabel and 
Joshua. For, as | have often said, the signs or visions 
that God gives in addition to the word are necessary for 
weak and afflicted souls, to strengthen them the more in 
their faith, who cannot cling to the mere word as well as 
to an image and sign. For it is a great thing to believe 
that God has given us 





The spirit is gracious and favorable, and comes to 
human hearts with difficulty. But the reckless enthusiasts 
rumble and rush along, and quickly boast of the Spirit so 
surely that they do not want to suffer any image or sign, 
and can believe all things at once, even the mere word, 
without sign. Here, however, even though Joshua and 
Zerubbabel are great men before God, and truly have a 
mighty faith, it is still so weak that God must instill faith 
in them with visions and interpretations, like young 
children. It is not such an easy thing about faith and 
spirit, so easily the rude spirits can talk about it. 

(3) The prophet says, "The angel has awakened him, 
as one is awakened from sleep. For this is to be another 
sermon to Prince Zerubbabel, showing how Zerubbabel 
is stupid and lazy in his heart, sleeping in unbelief, and 
does not see the light of the Spirit that wants to help him. 
For the prophet to be awakened means that the prince 
Zerubbabel is to be awakened from his sleep. As if he 
were to say in words, "Zerubbabel, you have set your 
heart's eyes on your inability to see light and help, and 
so you sleep in the darkness and night of your unbelief. 
But awake, and behold, it is day; the grace of God shines 
upon thee, and will be with thee. Open your eyes and let 
go of your inability, there is another who will do it 2c. 

4 The face of this golden candlestick is a little different 
from that of Moses' candlestick, Ex 25:31 ff. Mosi's 
candlestick has tubes on the sides, on the shaft or stick 
2c., but this one stands straight up with its shaft, and has 
on top a round, large, wide plate or bowl, which | have 
translated a hoop; and on the same plate around seven 
lamps in a ring, which all burned and shone; and so that 
the light is not extinguished for lack of oil, there are 
seven ladles or tubes, 


1846 Erl. 42, SIS-SIS. 


Interpretations on the Prophets. W. VI. 3401-3404. 


1847 





which are full of oil, always to follow. For we cannot know 
what form these ladles had, whether they were like pots 
or jugs or tubes. Oil was poured into the lamps with them, 
that is enough for us; they may or may not have been 
like pots or jugs, and they were all made of pure gold. In 
Hebrew it also says that there were more than seven of 
these ladles. For the text reads: Septem et septem 
infusoria pro lucernis, that is, seven and seven ladles 
for the lamps. This is almost as if seven ladles belonged 
to each lamp, to indicate that the lamps were abundantly 
supplied with oil, and that there was no worry that they 
would go out. 


V. 4-6. And | answered [and said unto] the angel that 
talked with me, My lord, what is this? And the angel 
that talked with me answered and said unto me, 
Knowest thou not what these things are? And | said, 
No, my lord. And he answered and said unto me, This 
is the word of the LORD of Zerubbabel, saying, It shall 
not be by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith 
the LORD of hosts. 

5 This is the interpretation of the lampstand and the 
whole face, namely, that just as the lampstand with its 
burning lamps and ladles stands between the two oil 
trees, so God wants to be with and among the people 
with His Spirit, especially with and among the two heads, 
Joshua and Zerubbabel. And he especially meets the 
thoughts of Zerubbabel, because he says to him: "It shall 
not be done by army or power, but by my spirit. As if to 
say, "Cast your eyes around you and see where the 
power is that will defend the king of Persia and all his 
enemies, and will help you and strengthen you. For thou 
canst not otherwise devise a way how it should and 
would be done; but | will show thee another way, that 
thou mayest not have such thy way. My spirit shall do it, 
and it shall strengthen thee with thine own, and shall give 
the king of Persia a gracious mind to build thee in peace, 
and to help thee with all his captains. And all this 
because my lampstand, my Spirit, is among you, and | 
am gracious to you and will be well with you. 


For whom God pleases, no one will harm. And Solomon 
says [Proverbs 16:7], "Whoever pleases God, he also 
makes his enemies favorable to him." 

006 Now therefore this is the opinion, O Zerubbabel, 
thou hast my word, which shineth unto thee out of the 
candlestick, which is to build thee by Zechariah and 
Haggai. Then look up, and be content. For where my 
word is, there is my spirit, there am | myself. And if | be 
with thee, who shall be against thee? | will make thee at 
peace for the building which | have called thee to do. 
Only do what my word says, and let me take care where 
you may have peace before the king of Persia and all 
your enemies. | will be powerful enough. | can make their 
hearts different, as | want, so that the ones you fear the 
most will help you the most. 

(7) This is once again a defiant, mighty promise, that 
Zerubbabel will be so secure from such great enemies, 
and that this will happen so easily, without any effort, war 
or swordplay. God thereby shows us once again, for our 
comfort, His omnipotence, how He has our hearts and 
the hearts of all enemies so powerfully in His hands that 
they may not harm us, if He wills; and in addition, He 
must also help us where He wills. About that, in the New 
Testament, the enemies help best when they harm the 
most, that even death, the greatest enemy, must help us 
to live, just when it strangles us. 

But the interpretation is this: The candlestick 
signifies the preaching state or office. The same 
lampstand is single, that is, the preachers and teachers 
of God's people are of one mind and teach the same 
thing, as Zechariah and Haggai do with their comrades. 
And is golden, that is, divine wisdom, and not of clay or 
earth, that is, they have not the word of man. The seven 
letters on it mean that although they teach the same 
thing and there is one spirit in them, they have different 
gifts, as Paul testifies Rom. 12, 7.8. 1 Cor. 12, 4. 7. ff. 
Eph. 4, 11. Now the light is the word, which they preach 
bodily, each according to his lamp, measure, and 


1) This "where" is given in Latin by "zuonaoao. 


1848 


Erl. 42, 215-218. 


The oil is the grace of the Holy Spirit, which keeps such 
light among the people of God, and is always with and 
with the word, so that it always has an emphasis and 
consequence, and the word neither ceases nor abates. 
The ladles or tubes are the prophets, from whom the 
external teachers and preachers take and receive what 
they teach. For prophets are those who are not 
enlightened by men but by God, and other men take from 
them. Therefore, the same ladles are many times seven 
to indicate that God had always given and wanted to give 
prophets to this people, so that they would be abundantly 
supplied with prophets and with God's Word and Spirit. 

(9) The angel, answering to the prophet's question, 
means: "Don't you know what it is? As if he should say, 
you should know it, because you are also a piece of the 
lampstand. For otherwise this answer of the angel is read 
as unnecessary and superfluous, as if he did not know 
how the prophet did not understand this face. But now it 
is spoken quite kindly, as a father speaks to a child: Do 
you not know, my dear Zechariah, what this is? You are 
in it yourself 2c. But what the two olive trees and two 
beaks are, will follow in the text. 


V. 7. Who are you, you great mountain, which is a 
plain before Zerubbabel? 


(10) For more comfort he turns to the mountain, that 
is, against the kingdom of Persia, of which Zerubbabel 
feared, and is challenged in faith, as has been heard. For 
just as he rebuked Satan in the presence of Joshua, so 
he rebukes the kingdom of Persia in the presence of 
Zerubbabel, calling it a great mountain (for it was a 
mighty kingdom), according to the Scriptures, which call 
all kingdoms and principalities mountains. But these are 
sweet, fatherly words, as when a father has chastised his 
child, and wants to nurse it again and entice it to him, he 
scolds the rod in front of the child, and says: Oh, you false 
rod, you have chastised my little son, wait, you shall 
never do it, my little son is pious 2c. So

Here, too, since God had well punished the Jewish 
people through the Babylonians, that also Zerubbabel is 
still afraid of the same rut, and is stupid to believe God, 
here he scolds the same empire before his ears, and 
says: it should no longer be a great, terrible mountain 
before Zerubbabel, before which he is afraid, but as a 
beautiful, funny plain, that is, through God's spirit it 
should be funny, friendly and helpful to the Jews. 


And he shall bring up the first stone, so that people 
will shout. Good luck! Good luck! 


(11) Then he strengthened the nursing child, and 
promised that it should now be established and proceed. 
He shall bring up the first stone, that is, he shall build up 
and lead the building from the foundation that was laid 
before and prevented for a time, so quickly and 
blessedly that everyone will be favorable and inclined, 
even happy about it. What beautiful words and promises 
of God to awaken and maintain the faith of Zerubbabel. 

12 Thus we see how difficult it is to raise a stupid 
conscience. For here God must act on both sides of 
Zerubbabel with rich words; here reproving the enemy 
and making him small, there comforting his heart and 
making it large. For it is a tender, soft thing about a 
conscience. 

13) These words in Latin: Exaequabit gratiam 
gratiae ejus, which in Hebrew say: Cum clamoribus 
gratia, gratia ei, | have translated: "that one will shout. 
Happiness! Happiness!" indicates the joy one has when 
one rejoices in a building that is going on, and everyone 
wishes happiness to it, and wants [it] to be finished. For 
that twice gratia vel favor, that is. In the Hebrew way, 
gratia vel favor means that there will be one here and 
one there, and that there will be many who like the 
building and wish them luck, which the logici distributive 
say is the same as when one is building and there comes 
one here and one there who praises it and says, "Oh, 
how well it is going up and pleases everyone. Such 
praise of many and liking of the building is called gratia, 
gratia ei; id est, habet gratiam, est egregium cert; so 
that it could also be translated: Ei, wie fein ist das; 


1850 ex. 42, 218-220. Interpretations on the Prophets. W. vi, 3406-3409. 


1851 





truly a praiseworthy building 2c. With this, he wants to 
assure Serubabel that not only should it be built, but also 
that it should be built finely and beautifully, so that 
everyone will like it, appreciate it, praise it, and wish it 
happiness. 


V. 8, 9: And the word of the Lord came unto me, 
saying, The hands of Zerubbabel have founded this 
house; his hands also shall finish it, that ye may know 
that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. For who 
is he that despiseth these few days? 2c. 


14 Here the prophet comes with a sermon to further 
strengthen Zerubbabel against a new challenge he had 
from his own, namely, that some of them considered the 
work small and impossible, as Haggai also rebukes 
them, saying [Cap. 1, 2/: "This people saith, It is not yet 
time to build the house of the LORD"; and Ezra Cap. 3, 
12/ says how many of the ancients who had seen the 
former temple wept when they saw the foundation of this 
temple; and afterwards Zechariah also Cap. 8, 6/ says: 
"Do they think it impossible in the sight of the rest of the 
people at this time; should it also be impossible in my 
sight, saith the LORD of hosts?" 

(15) From all this it is evident that many of the people 
were of loose faith. Some may have mocked, especially 
those who were well off with Tobiah, their enemy, of 
whom Nehemiah writes [Cap. 2:19]. So Zerubbabel 
heard these and similar words: "Oh, what are we 
building? It will come to nothing; we are too poor and 
small to do it. But the others: Yes, yes, build quickly, you 
will do it, you are fine people for it 2c.; that Zerubbabel 
also had to fight with his own people, so that they would 
not become despondent through useless mouths, 
renegade, and leave to build and prevent him. For what 
God is called and wants to have must be contested on 
all sides, tempted by Satan from within and without. 

16 Now Zechariah repeats the previous sermon, 1) 
how Zerubbabel is to accomplish the building. And adds 


the piece: "Who is he that hath passed these few days? 
1) In the old editions: "Widerumb holet". 


echte?" That he might rebuke the useless mouths, as he 
did above [Cap. 3, 2/ Satan and the great mountain, for 
the comfort of Zerubbabel. And this is the opinion: You 
judge by reputation and not by my word. According to 
appearance the work is small, and yet my words are 
glorious. But if you believed my words, you would not be 
so offended by the small increase. Therefore keep your 
mouths shut, and do not make Zerubbabel and the 
others mad or despondent to me, as they did in the 
wilderness of old, and they deterred the people from 
entering the land of Canaan [Numbers 13:32]. For who 
are ye despisers, that esteem the low estate of the 
building at this time more than my word, and deceive 
them that esteem my word more than the low estate? 
17 For "little time" is the name given to it, because at 
that time the building was little, just as Paul [Eph. 5:16] 
calls the days evil, because evil is done in them, and 
good days, because they are good. And in the Hebrew it 
reads thus: Quis contemnit ad diem parvorum, which | 
cannot well give in German, without thus: Who despises 
at the time of the small? that is: Who is it then who 
despises my word, because of the fact that at this time 
everything is still small, and not at all equal to my word? 
As if he should say, | will make it equal and great 
enough. Therefore | do not know how to translate it very 
well, because thus: Who despises these small days? 2c. 


V. 10 For they shall rejoice, and see the pinnacle of 
the hand of Zerubbabel, with the seven, which are the 
eyes of the LORD, that run through all the land. 


18 In Hebrew, weight or measure means a stone; 
therefore the crenellated stone is here translated: "the 
crenellated measure"; and is, of course, what with us the 
masons call the Richtscheit, since the lead weight hangs 
in it, or whatever other measure for the building the Jews 
and the peoples used against the morning. What great 
joy is it, then, that one will see the straight edge or weight 
in Zerubbabel's hand? | think he does not mean the bad 
sight, but that through Zerubbabel the building shall be 
made so that one must confess that God's eyes and 
spirit have 


1852 Erl. 42, S20-S22. interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 4, 10-14. 


He did this, and led the rod into the hand of Zerubbabel, 
to shut the mouths of all those who despise such small 
days and despair of the building. 

019 For the seven that shall be with Zerubbabel (saith 
he) are the eyes of the LORD, that is, his Spirit with 
divers gifts. He shall be present, strengthening and 
helping with grace, both among the Jewish people and 
in the kingdom of Persia, that is, in all lands, so that it 
may not be by the sword nor by the power of the army, 
but by the Spirit of God, as he said above [v. 6]. Thus we 
also heard above [Cap. 3, § 45 f.] that "seven eyes" 
mean the Spirit of God with His gifts. 


V.11-14. And | answered and said unto him, What 
are the two olive trees on the right hand and on the left 
hand of the candlestick? And | answered the second 
time, and said unto him, What are the two branches of 
the olive trees, which are by the two golden beaks [of 
the golden candlestick], to break off the praise of the 
golden candlestick? And he said unto me, Knowest 
thou not what these are? And | said, No, my lord. And 
he said, They are the two sons of oil, which are with 
the ruler of all the earth. 


020 Here the prophet himself indicates what this is, 
that the lampstand stands between the two olive trees 
and the two olive branches, saying, "The two olive trees 
and the two olive branches are the two olive children, 
that is, Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the prince 
of Judah. With this vision they shall be comforted and 
assured that God's Word and Spirit will be with them with 
grace and will stand with them in this work. He calls them 
children of oil in the Hebrew way, not only according to 
the oil trees and branches by which they are signified, 
but also according to the power and interpretation of the 
oil, which we would have to say in German: "There are 
two who are fat and full, that is, they have enough and a 
gracious God; just as Isaiah Cap. 5:1 also says: "My 
friend has a vineyard in a fat place," that is, where he 
stands well and is pleasing to God. 

1) In the original and in the old editions: "dlehern". 





W. VI, 3409-3412. 1853 


21) That he sees two different visions, as two olive trees 
and two olive branches or two olive ears, is one thing, 
just as Pharaoh's dream of the seven oxen and seven 
ears of corn was one thing [Gen. 41:26], that God uses 
two signs to indicate one thing. But whoever wishes, may 
interpret the two olive trees as the priesthood and 
principality in the Jewish people, from which the two 
branches, Joshua and Zerubbabel, have grown up as 
the most prominent and special above others, and stand 
high in the top, and serve the Lord of all the world, or of 
the whole country. 

22 But what the two golden beaks are, and how they 
have been shaped, | really do not know, and let here 
guess who can. It is beyond my art, also find no one who 
makes us certain in it. | have translated it thus: two 
beaks, so that one breaks off; alone, that | would not 
have to leave a window in the text, and have imitated the 
lampstand of Moses, 2 Mos. 25, 38, which also had 
beaks, and thought it would be fine for the sake of 
interpretation. For among the teachers there must also 
be those who sweep and clean the light, 3) so that [it] is 
not extinguished by filth, as is meant in Mosi's 
lampstand. For the first teachers, as stated above [§ 8], 
lay the foundation and plant; but where others do not 
follow, watering and sustaining such teaching, the flesh 
and blood is rotten and let, and causes the light to get a 
taint and scour, from which it becomes dark, until it is 
even extinguished. This is the office of the teachers, to 
exhort and to encourage with the doctrine which they 
have received. St. Paul says Romans 12:8: "He that 
exhorteth, let him wait for exhortation. They do not kindle 
any other light, but they sweep and preserve the light 
they have kindled; for they teach nothing new, but 
always stir up, urge, and persevere with the same first 
teaching against the rotten Adam. 

Now, this interpretation is not wrong; but as | said, | 
cannot stand on the text. St. Jerome has also interpreted 
it into Latin: Quid sunt duae spicae olivarum, quae 
sunt juxta duo rostra aurea, in quibuss 

2) In the old editions: "Ehern". 


3) In the original "butzen", that is, to take away the snoots "butze"’, 
to snort the light. In Latin: 


1854 Erl. 42, 2s2-22s. Interpretations on the Prophets. 


W. VI, 3412-3416. 1855 





sunt suffusoria ex auro? That is, what are the two 
branches of oil by the two golden snouts or tubes, in 
which are the little pots of gold? From which it can be 
seen that St. Jerome meant here that there were two 
snouts or tubes, like the spigot or tap on a barrel, 
through which the wine runs out, and that by the same 
tubes there were pots or other golden vessels, into 
which the oil ran through the tubes and was then poured 
into the lamps. But in the commentary on Zechariah he 
makes it thus: Quid sunt duo rami olivarum, qui in 
manibus duarum narium aureorum sunt, et quae 
infundunt et retrahunt suffusoria aurea? that is: What 
are the two branches of oil, which stand there between 
the two golden noses or snouts, and pour in and draw 
back the golden watering-pots? 

24 From this | understand that St. Jerome did not 
understand the text either; what am | to make of it? The 
Hebrew word Zantroth [XXXXXX] they are called noses 
or 
Toe, through which something oozes, as through the 
nose from the head oozes the filth. If this were true, it 
would be indicated herewith, 





that these noses or points would have been at the 
candlestick, that the lights would have been swept by it, 
according to my above said understanding. So the 
Hebrew reads: Quid sunt duae spicae olivae in manu 
duarum narium aureorum, evacuantium superne 
aurum? that is: What are the two oil ears, between the 
two golden points, which empty the gold from above? 
From this | have so much, that the two golden tongues 
or gutters, or what [it] was, hovered above the lamps and 
flowed out, perhaps into golden vessels, which he here 
calls gold; or calls gold, the whole candlestick with 
lamps, and with everything, ut evacuantium a 
superioribus auri scilicet candelabri feces supernas 
in lampadibus. Whether the flowing was oil or the oil 
was yeast, | do not know. And why should | grope long 
in the darkness? | can't find it. | say that | do not know, 
and let the little piece go, like other dark pieces more, 
because not so great power lies in it, if we have the sum 
of it, that Serubabel should be confident by the help and 
assistance of God's Spirit 2c. 


The fifth chapter. 


V. 1. 2. And | turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and 
looked, and behold a flying book. And he said unto me, 
What seest thou? | [but] said: | see a flying book 
twenty cubits long, and ten cubits broad. 


(1) Thus do the holy apostles: when they have 
preached the faith and Christian doctrine, they 
afterwards proclaim the future deceivers and false 
teachers, as Christ also does, saying Matt. 24:5, "Many 
shall come under my name, saying, | am Christ, and 
shall deceive many," that they may warn us to beware, 
and to abide by the pure doctrine. Zechariah does the 
same here. After he has preached how the temple and 
the service of God are to be set up again 





He now proclaims here how it will be with the 
descendants afterwards, namely, that they will no longer 
have the Spirit among them. The lampstand will be 
taken away and will fall on the teachings of men and 
their own works, as the Pharisees and Sadducees did 
when Christ shows us in the Gospel. That is why the 
prophet has the golden lampstand before him. For in his 
time it was well, the Spirit of God was with them. But 
when he turns around and looks behind him, he 
becomes aware of another thing, namely a great book 
that was to come after him. For to see behind him is to 
see what is to come. Just as Abraham saw the ram in 
the hedge behind him [Gen. 22:13]. But to have before 
the eyes is to see the present.

2 And look at it, this face is a masterly painting or picture, 
which teaches us in the finest way what human 
teachings are, both before God and the world. First of all, 
it is "a book", so that one does not doubt that it means 
art and wisdom of the scholars. For books are the 
scholars' emblems, and Moses and the prophets also 
made books. 

3. but it is "a flying book," that is, it is a doctrine that goes 
by preaching in momentum. For to fly means to speak or 
to preach, as the cherubim with their wings also signify 
[Ex. 25:20]. For the oral word flies along in the air like a 
bird. Therefore the poets also give their Mercurio wings 
on his feet. 

4 So the tender fruit, the doctrine of men, does not want 
to be a book that lies under the pew or in the box, but 
wants to come forth among the people, and be preached 
and heard, even much more and above God's word, so 
that it could not be called finer than "a flying book". Book, 
because it pretends to great wisdom, art and spirit, and 
wants to help and advise the world, as St. Paul says: it 
has a semblance of wisdom, Col. 2, 23. Flying, because 
it has many preachers and disciples, who drive it; and 
where they should not wash and chat about it, their belly 
would burst with great art and spirit, so greedy and 
heated are they to teach, like the useless washer Elihu 
does Job 32, 18. So the book bows to and fro. So the 
Pharisees' laws went with painting among the people, 
that they also suppressed God's commandment with it, 
Matth. 15, 3., and Paul speaks [Tit. 1, 11.] that they turn 
back whole houses, deceive and increase; and [2 Tim. 
2, 17.]: "Their word eats around like cancer." In short, 
false doctrine does not go, but it beguiles, and people fall 
to it and cling to it as if they were mad. We can see this 
even now with our Rottengeistern. 

Some say that the prophet saw this book flying out 
of the temple, to mean that false teaching wants to be 
holy and spiritual, and boasts of God's Spirit. But 
because this is not in the text, | let it remain that the 
prophet has seen it fly badly, and never 





gend heredity. For the doctrine of men has also no 
certain arrival, but flew and swarmed like a swarm of 
bees, and like a dream it seems to one that they 
themselves do not know where they got it, without [it] 
being given by the devil. Nor does it say here whether 
the book was closed or open. But | think it was open, 
because Zechariah sees how large it is, and perhaps, 
like Mosi's tablets, a large letter, which can be closed 
round. For so there is the Hebrew word Megillah 1) sn‘], 
a volvendo. For so they have made the books before 
times, that one has wound them in, as the painters wind 
in their cloths. Now, this art wants to stand open and be 
seen; that is one thing. For we do not read that there was 
idolatry among the Jews after that. But instead of the 
former idolatry, here comes the book, the art, wisdom 
and doctrine, which the right idolatry causes in the heart, 
that is, the conceit and man's commandments in the 
things of God. Therefore the prophet does not see an 
idol, but a book. 

Secondly, it is a large book, and has the same length 
and width that Solomon's hall had before the temple [1 
Kings 6:3], as it is said above [§4] that the doctrine of 
men is everywhere a great thing in the sight of the world, 
having great appearance and prestige, great 
coincidence and following, great power and obedience, 
far more than God's word. Moreover, it is also great and 
heavy to bear, for it has many, even innumerable laws, 
as Christ says Matth. 23, 4, that they lay infallible 
burdens on people 2c. Again, God's commandments are 
light and small, 1 John 5:3, for they are few in number, 
as they are all contained in one commandment, Romans 
13:9. Nor do we abandon the light commandments and 
submit to the heavy and infallible laws of men, which all 
teach outward things and go beyond the Scriptures, as 
Solomon's hall stood outside the temple [1 Kings 6:3]. 

7 But whoever wants to, may also interpret the flying 
in such a way that the doctrine of men is of such a kind 
that it never gives rest nor tranquility to the conscience, 
as St. Paul says Eph. 4, 14. 


1) In the old editions: "Megalla". 


1858 Erl. 42, 227-229. 


Wind weaves a reed, that we must be uncertain and 
uncertain. Therefore this book must also weave and 
float, and nowhere rest nor lie still. Mosi's book, 
however, lies and rests in the golden ark [Mos. 40, 20.5 
Mos. 10, 5], because God's word and teaching is quiet 
and calm, makes consciences quiet, sure and calm, 
where it is grasped in faith. So St. Paul also chides them 
1 Tim. 1, 7: "They do not know what they speak or say", 
that is, they do not teach anything consistent or certain, 
but only make consciences mislead and restless. Thus 
we have what is the doctrine of men in the sight of men, 
namely, a glorious thing, having great art, wisdom, 
appearance, power, and chance; and yet difficult and 
extensive, in addition uncertain, inconstant, uncertain, 
and fickle, since there is nothing behind it, a vain, 
deceitful splendor and specter. But what it is before God 
follows: 


v. 3 And he said unto me, This is the curse that 
goeth forth upon all the land. 


(8) The book is a curse and a thing of shame in the 
sight of God, by which a whole country is cursed and 
deprived of blessing. For the word of God is blessing, 
and brings blessing and grace with it, because it 
preaches, not our work and righteousness, but Christ's 
blood and God's righteousness. For this is what the 
Pharisees did among the Jewish people, when they 
overruled God's commandment through their doctrine of 
men, Matth. 15, 3, as we will hear; as it is the nature and 
manner of the doctrine of men to lead from the truth, Tit. 
1, 14. There must be curse and wrath. And here he 
almost indicates himself what the flying of this book is, 
when he says, "This curse goes out over the whole 
land." As if he should say: You have seen rightly that it 
flews. Indeed it does flee and run through the whole 
land. For the Pharisee's teaching had brought the whole 
nation under him, just as the commandments and orders 
of men do in Christendom. 

(9) And should the abominable title deter us from all 
doctrines of men, that they be cursed or cursedness in 
the sight of God. Who would want to be cursed before 
God, and earn the curse with so much effort and work? 
as those do who torture themselves in the 
commandment of men. Where there is a curse, 


Interpretations on the Prophets. 





W. VI, 3418-3421. 1859 


Christ's blessing cannot be there. It does not only go 
through some houses, but over the whole country. But 
such a curse is now completely upon the Jewish people, 
that they have despised the gospel, which brought them 
the blessing promised in Abraham, and are now 
torturing themselves with their Talmud and rabbinical 
writings, which make them cursed before God, as the 
109th Psalm, v. 17, also says of them: "They do not want 
the blessing; therefore it shall come far from them. But 
they love the curse, so they shall also be clothed with it" 
2c. And to such a time this vision of the prophet goes 
most. For in Christ's time the curse was begun by the 
Pharisees, but after that it came in the Schwang, when 
the Jews were disturbed, and took the Talmud before 
them. This is the right curse, and the right great flying 
book. 


For all thieves are judged pious according to this 
book, and all perjurers are judged pious according to 
this book. 


(10) Here he touches and indicates the doctrine 
written in this book and taught from it, by which they are 
cursed. And though it is darkly set, yet | hold that the 
angel gathereth together such doctrines of men, in these 
two pieces, and will say this much: All their doctrine is, 
that they teach and praise thievery and ungodly living. 
For all Scripture gives the false teachers and 
commandments of men the two parts, that they teach 
hypocrisy and serve the belly, Rom. 16, 18. Through 
hypocrisy and beautiful glittering of works they lead 
away from faith and God's word to ungodly beings, as 
St. Paul Titus 1, 14. says, that the doctrine of men turns 
away from the truth; Rom. 16, 17. he says, "They are an 
offense and a sect apart from right doctrine." In sum, 
they are always fighting against the salvific word of God 
and pure faith. Through thievery and avarice they 
devour widows' houses, Matth. 23, 14. For all their 
doctrine is to gain money and goods, honor and glory, 
as St. Paul says Rom. 16, 18: "Such serve their own 
belly and not our Lord Jesus Christ"; and Phil. 3, 19: 
"Belly is their god"; and Ps. 5, 10: "Their mouth is an 
open grave"; and Ps. 14, 4: "They devour their own belly.

1861 





my people like food", and so henceforth, in all the 
prophets they are scolded stingy and belly servants. 

(11) So false teachers are thieves and miserly at 
first. For with a good appearance of holy life and doctrine 
they deceive the people, so that they are carried away 
with heaps. For that is called acting thievishly, when one 
steals away one's goods secretly. Yes, they are twofold 
thieves: First, that they take it from the people through 
hypocrisy and deceit. Secondly, that they take it from the 
mouths of the right preachers. For the right teachers 
should have what they take, and yet they must go 
behind. 

12. how the Pharisees did this is well taught in the 
Gospels, Matth. 15, 5. where Christ reproved them for 
abolishing God's commandment and taught that 
sacrifice was better than honoring father and mother. 
Matth. 23, 16. 17. They taught that the gold on the altar 
and at the temple was better than the altar and temple. 
They also had changers and merchants in the temple 
[Matth. 21, 12]. These were all thieves for their own 
profit; yet all this was not punished, but praised, and their 
doctrine judged them to be righteous who taught and did 
such things. But how such things are also practiced in 
the papacy by the stingy, insatiable altar boys and 
monastery guards, must no longer be indicated. It is a 
fact that they have taken the world's goods as thieves 
and scoundrels; nevertheless, they are called pious, 
holy people, according to their books and teachings, and 
they persecute those who do not keep up with them. It 
has been child's play with the Pharisees 2c. 

(13) Secondly, they are perjurers, that is, they are 
liars and blasphemers. For it was the way of the false 
prophets at that time, that they spoke their doctrine 
under God's name, and swore by God's name, as Isaiah 
laments in Cap. 48, 1: "Hear, ye of the house of Jacob, 
that swear by the name of the LORD, and think not of 
the LORD Israel with truth nor with judgment." And again 
[Jer. 5:2], "Though they say that the LORD liveth truly, 
yet they swear falsely. "2c. Because the doctrine of men 
is a lie, and yet it is taught under God's name as God's 
right word, and the 


If false teachers also stand on it, swear and swear, 
banish and curse, as St. Peter did when he denied Christ 
[Matth. 26, 72], here they are called swearers or 
perjurers. 

14 These are the two virtues that are ugly and hostile 
even in the eyes of the world, and are commonly found 
together when it is said, "He steals and lies a great deal. 
For they must preach lies, otherwise they are not given 
much. He who must preach the truth has nowhere to 
stay. If they want to get rich, they have to talk people out 
of it and steal it away with lies, as they used to say: "The 
world wants to be deceived. But all these lies remain 
unpunished; yes, it must be called vain wholesome 
teaching, and those are judged and praised as right 
preachers who teach it, but persecuted and condemned 
who punish it. These are they, the dear, beautiful thieves 
and liars, who devour all the world, and seduce it to 
wages for it, and thus ruin body and soul. 

V. 4. But | will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, 
and it shall come home to the thieves, and to them that 
swear falsely by my name, and shall abide in their 
house, and shall consume it, with the wood thereof, 
and with the stones thereof. 


15 Here he proclaims the punishment of such false 
teachers. For as long as the false teachers continue, 
there is such swearing, boasting and defiance; there 
must be vain truth, vain Holy Spirit, vain God, that their 
adversary might well despair, just before their great 
boasting and swearing. Therefore God must comfort 
them and proclaim that such boasting and swearing will 
not endure. O what have | suffered from the prophets in 
these short years, who wanted to persuade me badly 
with swearing and boasting that the spirit was with them. 
How confidently and defiantly the coiner drove, and all 
that was against him had to be nothing. How defiant are 
our blasphemous spirits now, how they go about! how 
stinking is everything that is said against them, as if they 
had won forever. 

16 But here is the text, and overthrows them, and 
comforts us. | will bring it forth, 


1862 en. 42, sai-234. Interpretations on the Prophets. W. VI, 3424-3427. 


1863 





he speaks. What is the bringing forth? Nothing else, but 
to bring it to light; | will make the book manifest before 
all the world, that it is a book of thieves and of lies. It is 
now glistening in darkness as a true and useful book; but 
| will strip it of its varnish and take away its color, so that 
everyone may see the thievery and lies, and that they 
will be disgraced and destroyed. | mean, Christ brought 
the teaching of the Pharisees to light through the gospel, 
so that all the world may see how they were vain ungodly 
things and covetous. This is what happened to all 
heretics. So it will also happen to our heretics; no 
boasting or shining will help. He says: | will bring it forth; 
as he also says in the Gospel [Matth. 15, 13]: "Every 
plant that my Father does not plant will be uprooted"; 
and St. Paul 2 Tim. 3, 9: "They will not carry it out, but 
their foolishness will be revealed to everyone. In short, 
God brings it forth. This is the first punishment of false 
teachers, that they become disgraced. 

17. after that, the other punishment: it shall come 
home to the thieves and false perjurers, and consume 
their house; that is, it shall condemn and destroy them. 
For it shall come out of the place, and shall deceive no 
man, when it is revealed. But they themselves will hang 
on to it, and will not leave it, but will defend and preserve 
it; therefore they will go to ruin over it and be destroyed, 
so that hardly a sign or memory will remain there, like a 
house that burns so that neither wood nor stones remain 
there, but a desolate place and burning place. 

018 For such is the plague of deceivers, that, though 
their lies come to light, and be brought to shame, yet 
they shall not depart from them, nor leave them, but 
stand firm with their heads, and let them not be told, and 
so keep the lies with themselves, because they flee the 
true saints, until they be utterly destroyed. 

(19) Thus the lie remained with the Jews, and they 
never ceased from it, until they were all destroyed, like 
a burned house. So did the Arians and all heretics. No 
one could talk them out of their senses. What 


But are they now? Nothing but a loud memory. Our mobs 
now and all the deceivers under the pope do not hear us, 
even though their lies have been brought out in the 
brightest light; they want to keep the lies with them and 
stick to them until they perish, so that neither stick nor 
stone remains there. This is what | have often said: 
Rotten spirits cannot be restored, for they sin against the 
Holy Spirit, who has no forgiveness forever [Matth. 12, 
32. Marc. 3, 29.]. This means here, that the book comes 
home to the thieves and liars, that they perish over it. 


V. 5. 6. And the angel that talked with me came out, 
and said unto me, Lift up thine eyes, and behold, what 
cometh out? And | said, What is it? And he said, A 
bushel cometh out. And he said, This is her figure 
throughout all the land. 


20) This face of the prophet, | observe, also goes 
there, as the next previous one, namely on the false 
teachers. For as we have seen above [Cap. 4,:] 21), this 
prophet also likes to bring two faces to one story [Cap. 4, 
11. Gen. 41, 26.), just as Pharaoh also had two dreams 
of one story, to mean that the false teaching among the 
Jewish people would certainly be in the future, after the 
pure teaching. As it is always certain, where the word of 
God arises, that false teachings also arise, because the 
devil cannot stand it, that God's word should remain pure 
and clear. 

(21) What the bushel signifies, the angel himself 
signifies, saying, It is their eye, or form, in all the land. 
That eye is called a form in the Scriptures is shown by 
Moses in Book 2, Cap. 10, 15, when he says that the 
locusts covered the eye of the whole land, that is, the 
appearance or form of the ground; and Ps. 6, 8: "My eye 
is rotten with grief," that is, my form 2c. So here too, we 
take eye for form or outward appearance. But what is it 
that their outward appearance is so much like a bushel? 
Here there may be various uses of the bushel, various 
likenesses. First, that, as the bushel is a special 
measure, and has its size, so let the hypocrite's life and 
outward appearance also be written with 


1864 kn. 42, ss4-L36. Interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 5, 5-8. 


The hypocrites are bound to special ways and rules, to 
special works, places, food and clothing, and everything 
is vainly measured out by the teachings and 
commandments of men, since there is neither spirit nor 
freedom. On the other hand, as the bushel is empty, and 
there is nothing inside of it of grain or corn, so let the 
hypocrite's nature be only an empty appearance and 
form of a good life, since there is nothing inside, as St. 
Paul says: "They have the appearance of a godly life, 
but they deny the power of it. 

22 But | now maintain that this face rhymes with the 
previous one. Thus | consider the bushel to be their 
spiritual, miserly life, which he calls a thieving life above 
[v. 4]. For by their pretty appearance and doctrine they 
deceive all the world, and eat up all their goods; 
therefore it is fair to compare it to a bushel, since grain 
and food are measured into the sack. For they are all 
about the belly, about eating and drinking; there is 
always a measuring in the sack that is not to be filled, 
and the bushel not to be filled. So their form is a bushel, 
pretty and beautifully formed, in fine measure and giving, 
but stingy and thieving, so that they are not to be filled, 
always allowing themselves to be filled, and always 
pouring themselves out into the sack. This interpretation 
pleases me, not only because it rhymes with the 
previous one, but also because of the custom of the 
bushel, because the bushel is mainly used to measure 
out and fill in grain. Now the interpretation is always the 
most certain and best, since one interprets the custom 
of the thing, much more than since one interprets the 
shape or form. 


V. 7.8 And, behold, there went a penny of lead, and 
there was a woman sitting in a bushel. And he said, 
This is ungodliness. 


(23) This rhymes with the previous vision, according 
to the other piece, namely, that the false teachers are 
not only stingy, but also ungodly, and deceive people. 
Therefore the woman sits here in the bushel, and has 
the name impietas, that is, godless teaching. For the 
sitting means the teaching office, Ps. 1, 1. and Matth. 23, 
2.: "They sit on Mosi's chair, the Pharisees and scribes." 
024 But she sitteth in a bushel, that is, she reigneth 
among the stingy hypocrites, who hearken unto her, and 
hold to such ungodly doctrine. 


W. VI, 3427-3430. 1865 


For this it goes far, because "in the whole country (he 
says) this is its shape". Hypocrisy and lies always have 
a large following. 

25 And is a woman; why not a man? Because her 
teaching does not teach anything masculine or divine (for 
man is God's image, says St. Paul [1 Cor. 11:7]), but 
according to beautiful, tender reason; as it writes and 
judges, so must the teaching go, let God's word remain 
where it can. Now reason is beautiful to look at, like a 
woman against a man, but it is not fit to teach and 
govern; just as a woman is forbidden to teach and 
govern, 1 Tim. 2, 12 [1 Cor. 14, 34, 35]. Yet here she 
teaches and rules in hypocrisy. For the woman sits in a 
bushel, and is a pretty dock to look at, against the right 
doctrine, which leads a manly, serious image, which is 
rough around the mouth, and has a sharp beard; for she 
is not hypocritical, and is serious. But women have 
smooth mouths; so also the hypocrite preachers. 

And he threw it into the bushel, and threw the lump 


of lead on his hole. 


Here follows the punishment of such hypocrisy and 
ungodly teaching. The angel pushes the woman into the 
bushel, so that she no longer sits so high and looks out 
from above, but has to bend down and stoop into the 
bushel; that is, through the gospel hypocrisy is 
overthrown and put to shame (for the angel means Christ 
and all the teachers of the gospel), just as above (v. 4) 
the book is brought forth and put to shame. But no 
improvement follows from this, but they only become 
more hardened and fall deeper into it, and want to defend 
it and keep it against the truth. Therefore this woman is 
not lifted out of the bushel, but is thrust into it and down 
to the ground, just as the book remains in the house of 
thieves and perjurers and consumes them. For they hold 
fast to it, and regard it not, that it be known of others for 
error and unchristian doctrine; they join together, and 
hold fast to their mind. 

The lump of lead on the top of the bushel is the divine 
judgment on them, that they are hardened in error, and 
cannot yet go out among others to preach. For they are 
no longer heard, and 


1866 Erl. 42, S3S-238. interpretations on the prophets. W. 


no longer believe them, because the truth has come to 
light, but they carry with themselves the great, heavy toil 
and burden of their unchristian doctrine and nature. For 
all false doctrine is called aven in the Scriptures, that is, 
toil and burden. And it can be seen how much more 
difficult and sour it is for the false saints than for the true 
saints. Therefore it is finely illustrated here that a heavy 
lump of lead lies on the hole. For the Christians are light, 
because they have a happy, good conscience, which no 
hypocrite can have. But the fact that the lump of lead 
moved or floated before it was thrown into the bushel 
means that such divine punishment is first threatened to 
the wicked, whether they would fear and amend 
themselves. But they despise both the promise and the 
prophecy. 


V. 9 And | lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, 
behold, two women came out, having wings that 
fluttered. They were wings like the wings of a deer, and 
they carried the bushel between heaven and earth. 


(28) Although the wicked are separated from the 
people of God, so that their bushel and wife, that is, their 
doctrine and life, are no longer suffered among the pious, 
as the first Psalm, v. 5, says: "The wicked do not abide 
in judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the 
righteous," nevertheless they do not stop their teaching, 
and always find both teachers and disciples practicing 
and acting their error and deceit. As we see especially in 
the case of the Jews, who do not cease from their error 
against Christ, which this face also especially shows. 
(29) The two wives signify the office of preaching or 
teaching, or all teachers and preachers, just as the two 
cherubim above the ark of Moses [Ex 25:18, 19] also 
signify. But that the cherubim are two, and the women 
also two, signifies that in all preaching or teaching, 
whether it be right or wrong, the two parts go together in 
the custom, minae et promissio, preaching and 
promise, which we call law and gospel. For even the 
wicked could not maintain their thing, unless they 
pretended a false law, that is, unless they compelled and 
drove the consciences with false terror and dread. 





VI, 3430-3432. 1867 


not to pretend to a false gospel, that is, to lure and hold 
out hearts with false comfort and promises. For every 
teaching must be done in such a way as to frighten and 
comfort the conscience, so that it pretends that God 
commands this or that and wants it, and promises God's 
grace and reward for the comfort of those who do it. 

30 Now, in the right teaching office, and above the ark, 
there are two cherubim as male images; but here, in the 
wrong teaching office, there are two female images at 
the bushel. For, as | also said above, reason is a 
beautiful woman, but she should not teach. She glistens 
well, but she is not fit to preach. But man's image is God's 
image, and teaches rightly, that is, God's word should 
teach. So now in the false teaching office there is all 
reason, and what is equal to reason; she is master and 
doctor, and she also begets God's word according to her 
conceit and pleasure. These are the two women who 
teach vain reason or carnal law and gospel, and not 
spiritual or God's law and the right gospel. 

(31) But that they had fluttering or spread wings means 
that the wicked are washy and talkative without ceasing, 
as St. Paul [Titus 1:10] calls them vaniloquos, useless 
washers; they can talk more about a flower than a pious 
teacher about a whole meadow. Summa, they know how 
to do their thing, and are not lazy; they never beat down 
their wings, and let no cobweb grow before their mouths, 
that they may spread their thing far and wide. They are 
more diligent and more valiant in spreading their error 
than the children of light are in spreading their truth. The 
mouths of the deceivers are never open. 

Their wings are also the wings of the deer. Some say 
they are stork's wings, some say they are harrier's wings. 
We have everywhere rendered the bird as Reiger's. 
Whatever bird it is, it is an unclean bird, forbidden to eat 
in the Law of Moses, Deut. 11, 14-19. Of course, they are 
not dove wings. All this is said: It is vain unclean, 
unspiritual and unholy preaching, which they do, since 
there is vain reason and no spirit nor anything pure 
inside. 


1868 Erl. 42, 238-241. interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 5, 9-11. 


Nevertheless they fly high and carry the bushel 
between heaven and earth, because their thing wants to 
float above and ride high before the world and reason. 
But they carry the bushel between heaven and earth, 
that is, their being with such teaching is neither heavenly 
nor earthly. For they have neither Joshua nor 
Zerubbabel, neither priesthood nor kingdom, neither 
spiritual nor temporal government, but hover and pass 
between the two, and attain neither. Heaven does not 
like them, so they do not want the earth, as we can well 
see in the Jews. Or such floating between heaven and 
earth may also be that her teaching gives no rest to the 
conscience, neither in temporal nor eternal goods, for 
she is without God's word. 


V. 10. 11. And | said to the angel who spoke to me: 
Where are these leading the bushel? And he said unto 
me, That an house may be built for him in the land of 
Sinear, and prepared, and set there upon his ground. 

34 The land of Sinear is Babylon, as Moses wrote in 
Book 1, Cap. 11, 2. The people of Judah were recently 
delivered from Babylon and brought back to Jerusalem; 
so this bushel is brought from Jerusalem back to 
Babylon, and not badly to Babylon, but to the land of 
Sinear, that is, to the old Babylon, where the tower was 
built, over which the languages were confused and 
divided [Gen. 11:6 ff]. By this, | think, it is understood that 
the people of the Jews were to be cast out from the right 
Jerusalem, the church of God, because of such ungodly 
teachings, and to come to Babylon, that is, to be 
scattered among all the Gentiles and languages, as we 
see that it is fulfilled, and Christ Himself also says Luc. 
21:24, that the Jews were to be scattered and 
imprisoned among all the Gentiles. For why else should 
he call the land Sinear, where the languages were first 
divided and scattered abroad? For we do not read that 
all the Jews came to Babylon, though many went there, 
and also many remained there before, who would not 
return to Jerusalem; that they also had two interpreters 
there, as Jonathan and Uncle, 1) highly renowned 
among them; and the 


1) In Latin: On‘tzlsrn. 


W. VI, 3432-3435. 1869 


Babylonian Targum, as Jewish law and doctrine stands 
inside. 

35 But what kind of house is it that is built for the 
bushel there? By this | understand the hardening of the 
Jewish people in their unbelief. For a house is where one 
abides and dwells. So they live scattered in all the world, 
and yet they remain in their faith and error. This is also 
that the same house is set on its foundation. For it is not 
built on the rock of Christ, but they stand firm on their 
own righteousness of works, as St. Paul writes of them 
[Rom. 10:3]. But the Christians are not set on their own 
ground, but Christ is the foundation stone, not laid in 
Babel, but in Zion, on whom all who trust 2) shall not be 
put to shame forever [Rom. 9, 33. Isa. 8, 14.]. 

From all this it may be understood that this face of 
the bushel is almost made and taken after the face of 
Moses, which he saw on Mount Sinai, when he was to 
imitate the ark [Ex. 25:10 ff], just as godless hypocrisy 
also always imitates and wants to be like the right 
doctrine and truth. There is a golden ark, here is a 
bushel; there is a mercy seat on it, here is a lump of lead 
on it; there God sits on the ark and mercy seat, here sits 
a woman in the bushel who is godless; there are two 
cherubim with wings, here are two women with wings; 
there the ark stands in Jerusalem, here the bushel goes 
to Babylon. 

(37) All things are imitated, and yet are most contrary 
to one another. For the wicked want to be holy, and also 
have the appearance, but it is a vain cursed, damned 
thing. For there is not the ark with the bread of heaven 
and the tablets of Moses. For they have neither law nor 
gospel right in their consciences, but fill their own mouths 
about their bellies. Item, Christ is not sitting there with 
grace, but the ungodly woman. Item, there is not the right 
office of preaching, the golden cherubim, but a self- 
chosen office and way of teaching. And so on it rhymes 
with no piece, and yet wants to be the same in all pieces. 


2) That is, all who trust in him. In Latin: ineonLinnt.

The sixth chapter. 


V.1-3. And | lifted up mine eyes, and looked. And, 
behold, there were four chariots coming out from 
between two mountains; and the same mountains 
were of brass. In the first chariot were red horses, in 
the second chariot black horses, in the third chariot 
white horses, in the fourth chariot strong colored 
horses. 

(1) This is a dark face, and others have interpreted it 
in many ways, by which it has become much darker. | 
leave each one his honor, and thank him for his 
diligence; what | understand, | will also present, until 
another does it better. In the next chapter, the prophet 
indicated with two visions how false teachers would 
come among the Jewish people, which was fulfilled by 
the Pharisees until the time of Christ, who punished 
them for it; and since they would not mend their ways, 
he let them go until they were scattered throughout the 
world, as we have heard. Accordingly, the prophet 
shows in this chapter how the true teaching of the gospel 
should go out into all the world, after Judaism has 
perished with its teaching; just as it happened that after 
the Pharisees’ teaching the gospel soon came and was 
preached in all the world. 

(2) In the first chapter [§ 68; Cap. 2, § 26] we heard 
that the fourth number means the four corners of the 
world, that is, the whole circle of the earth around 
Jerusalem; therefore, if four chariots are also seen here, 
they mean that the gospel of Christ is to be preached in 
all the world around Jerusalem and in the four corners 
under heaven. For not only horses are seen here, as 
above [Cap. 1, 8-11], but also chariots. In addition, these 
horses do not come together from other countries, as 
above, but go out from one to another into all countries; 
so that the appearance is very different from the first. 
The former brought tidings from all lands, that quiet 
peace might be everywhere; but these again bring the 
spirit of the Lord abroad, even into the land toward 
midnight. What the horses are, we will hear later in the 
text. 





(3) But the two mountains of brass, | believe, are the 
two testimonies of the gospel written in the Old 
Testament, namely the law and the prophets, as Paul 
says in Romans 3:21, that the righteousness of faith is 
testified by the law and the prophets, just as Moses and 
Elijah testified on Mount Thabor with their appearance 
[Matt. 17:3]. For out of the law and the prophets the 
apostles bring forth the gospel, and prove it thereby. 
Therefore it is good that these chariots come forth 
between these two mountains. And they are mountains 
of brass, that is, strong and enduring: for rust eateth not 
the brass, as it doth the iron. So the law and the prophets 
are great, strong, enduring witnesses of the gospel. For 
thus Christ also opened the minds of his disciples, that 
they might understand the Scriptures [Luc. 24:27]. So 
also our faith needs to have a good and sure foundation 
for itself, so that it may be certain of things. 


V.4. 5. And | answered and said unto the angel that 
talked with me, My lord, who are these? The angel 
answered and said unto me, They are the four winds 
which are under heaven, which come forth, as they 
stand before the ruler of all the earth. 


(4) In the Hebrew language, spirit and wind are the 
same word; therefore, where it says wind, one may read 
spirit, and even though one reads wind, it still means 
spirit. So these four chariots, according to the angel's 
self-interpretation, are four winds under heaven, that is, 
the spirit in the apostles, sent out from Jerusalem 
through all the world. In addition, he says that they stand 
before the ruler of all the earth, that is, they are Christ's 
servants, who is the Lord, set over all the earth, as the 
8th Psalm, v. 7, says. In their service these spirits stand 
and walk. For just as the angels who stand and serve 
before God are also called winds or spirits, Ps. 104:4: 
He makes his angels spirits or winds, and his servants 
flames of fire, so the apostles are also called spirits or 
winds here, 


1) In the original: or. 


1872 Erl. 42, L43-S45. Interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 6, 4-6. 


who minister before Christ, and are sent forth by him into 
the four winds of the world, that is, into every place on 
the face of the earth. And that he calls them "four winds 
under heaven" also means that the apostles should 
come with their preaching into all the world, under all the 
heavens, or from one place of heaven to another, as 
Christ speaks Matth. 24, 31. 

5 And here notice what a glorious testimony the 
apostles have here about their teaching. They are not 
shown to preach their own things, to have their own form 
or eyes, like the bushel above [Cap. 5, 6], but they serve 
the ruler Christ, and not themselves; they teach what he 
wants and pleases him, and do not come from 
themselves, but are sent by him, therefore they do not 
bring man's teaching, but God's word. And they are not 
horses alone, but chariots also, for they do not come 
with a living word, but bring with them all kinds of 
precious things and jewels, even armor and weapons, 
so that they may be prepared for war, that is, they bring 
with them all kinds of gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit 
through the gospel, so that Christians throughout the 
world may be adorned and strengthened to fight against 
sin, death and the devil, along with the world. For 
because they are horses and chariots, it means war and 
strife, as we also heard above [Cap. 1, § 35]. 

Summa, God's word does not come in vain nor idly 
into the race, it creates much good in the believers, and 
powerfully contends against the unbelievers; therefore 
there must be chariots with the horses. But no rider is 
seen here on the horses, nor man on the chariots, for 
Christ sits and rides alone on these horses and chariots, 
yet invisibly, in spirit and faith, and does not let men sit 
on them, nor lead or drive them. For he neither likes nor 
suffers the doctrine of men; he alone is the only Master 
and Teacher of us all, Matth. 23, 10. and, as the angel 
also says here, they do not serve any carter, rider or 
merchant, but the ruler in all bets, who leads, rides, sits, 
guides and drives here alone, that is Christ our Lord. For 
above, in the first vision [Cap. 1, 11], angels rode on 
horses to signify the kingdoms ruled by men. 





W. VI, 3439-3441. 1873 


V. 6. where the black horses were, they went about 
midnight, and the white ones went after them, but the 
colored ones went about noon. 

7 Here it is most dark with the horses, colors and 
countries, where they go. Well, we have made the 
apostles and preachers out of the steeds. The first ones, 
namely the red ones, are not seen here going out. These 
are, of course, the apostles and Christians who 
remained in Jerusalem and in Judaism, as little St. 
James, also St. Peter and John for a time, along with 
other disciples, as St. Stephen and his like. And these 
horses are red, that is, they remained among the 
murderous, bloodthirsty Jews, who strangled St. Jacob 
and St. Stephen, along with many others, even the Lord 
Christ himself, and before that the prophets. For | 
consider that the color of the horses signifies the country 
or people to which they are sent. So the first horses are 
red, and are sent to the Jews, and remain with them. 

8. but the black horses on the other chariot, and the 
white on the third chariot, are both sent about midnight. 
These are the apostles and disciples sent into Assyria, 
Persia, India and Syria, as Simon, Judah, Thomas, and 
their like. For we read in the Acts of the Apostles 
especially about Antioch, that there the Christianity 
increased very much, and also so, that there the 
disciples were called Christians first, and there was even 
a wide school of Christians [Apost. 11, 26]. Similarly, in 
Damascus, where St. Paul was converted, there were 
many disciples of Christ [Cap. 9, 10. ff]. Now both 
Antioch and Damascus, Jerusalem lie at midnight, 
without what have been theirs, which came into Assyria 
and Persia, as is said. 

(9) But what is the color here, that the blacks go to 
the first, and the whites after? | think it also means the 
same countries' way against the Jews. For black is the 
color of night, and signifies persecution, misfortune, and 
death. But white is the color of day and light, and 
signifies grace and happiness. Now the Jewish people 
had suffered so much from all such countries of 
midnight, and had experienced the black color, as the 
stories in the books of the kings show, and should also 
experience 


1874 ed. 42, 245-248. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3441-3444. 


1875 





full of the kings of Antioch, as the books of the 
Maccabees testify, that such lands, Assyria, Syria and 
Medes, were black, dark and cruel enough to the Jews. 
But now the Persian kings were gracious and favorable 
to them, as we have just heard [Cap. 1, § 6 ff.], that they 
granted them again to build the city of Jerusalem 2c. 
Therefore here the black horses go before, afterwards 
the white ones. For before, under the king of Babylon 
and Assyria, it was all black and night, but under the king 
of Persia it was all white and day. 

010 And the fact that two chariots with horses go to the 
same one place is also because Zerubbabel and Joshua 
with their people should be the more confident, because 
the chariots go most to the place where they are most 
afraid. Although it is also because the enemies of the 
Jews, as Syria, Babylon, Assyria, lie against Jerusalem, 
that they understand both places of the world as morning 
and midnight; therefore also two kinds of horses go 
there, as if the two kinds of places were to be counted 
for one place, when they are not one, but two places. So 
the morning place is not mentioned, because they both 
belong to one kingdom, and only the midnight place is 
mentioned, because the land of the Jews had to suffer 
the most misfortune from there. 

The colored horses are the apostles who came to 
Arabia, Edom, Egypt and Moorland, as St. Matthew and 
his companions. For these countries lie toward the 
middle of Jerusalem, and are multicolored, that is, black, 
red, and white. For they have been at times unfavorable 
and at times favorable to the Jewish people, and have 
often shed their blood, as the histories, especially of the 
Edomites, Ishmaelites, and the like, indicate; so that the 
Jews may again be comforted that they should not fear 
such countries to build the temple, as it is certain that 
such countries shall in time still receive God's word and 
spirit, and obey the ruler of all lands. . 

V. 7 The mighty went and removed, that they might 
pass through the country. And he said, Go ye, and 
pees through the country. And they went through the 
and. 


12 The fourth chariot is divided here into two chariots. 
For above [v. 3] he says that in the fourth chariot there 
were strong colored horses, and yet here he separates 
the strong horses from the colored ones, so that it 
lappears as if two chariots, that is, the black and white 
lones, went into the empire of Persia and Medes, which 
lhad both morning and midnight toward Jerusalem. And 
two chariots, that is, the colored and strong ones, went to 
tthe Roman Empire, which had both noon and evening 
toward Jerusalem, and so instead of the red horses of the 
first chariot, which remained at Jerusalem, here come the 
strong horses, so that nevertheless four chariots remain 
in the four elders of the world, that is, sent into all the 
world. These are the strong horses, St. Peter and Paul 
land St. John, the noblest and strongest apostles, sent to 
the Roman Empire, where there was truly great 
persecution of the Gospel. For this reason, strong 
lapostles were sent here, and especially St. Paul, the 
lapostle to the Gentiles, was chosen for this purpose 
[Rom. 11:13]. For this reason a special command is given 
to them, saying, "Go through the country," that is, through 
tthe world's circle. For the apostles themselves did not 
know for the first time that they were to preach the gospel 
to the Gentiles until they were exhorted from heaven. 


V. 8. And he called unto me, and spake unto me, 
saying, Behold, they that go forth into the north country 
make my spirit to rest in the north country. 


013 Here he sheweth this vision of things to come, for 
the use and custom of the Jews, even at this present time, 
when they shall build the temple, to comfort and 
strengthen them. As if to say: Why do you fear and worry 
Iso much about the Persians and the enemies at 
midnight? Behold, they shall not alone now leave you 
contented and favorable, as ye have heard hitherto, but 
lalso in time to come they shall be much more favorable 
to you. Now when the gospel shall come, and Christ with 
his Spirit, the same shall make them brethren and friends 
lunto you, that they may have the same spirit of the Lord 
which ye have, except they should hurt you, or hinder 
YOU. 





1876 Erl. 42, S4S-25V. Interpretation of Zechariah (I), Cap. 


6, 8-11. W. VI, 3444-3447. 1877 





14 This is also the reason why only the horses that 
go on the north side are indicated here before all others, 
that they should make the spirit of the Lord rest in the 
land on the north side. For he strikes and touches their 
hearts with it, which at that time were most afraid of the 
lands on the north side, as Jeremiah had said before, 
and they themselves were well aware of it through 
experience [Jer. 1, 14. 15. 6, 1. 22. ff]. For no one can 
believe the effort it takes to comfort and straighten a 
despondent, stupid conscience; and again, the effort it 
takes to frighten and put fear into a hard, stubborn 
conscience. Both are impossible to see," and God must 
do it Himself. 

That is why he needs so many words and faces here 
(as we see), and yet he uses them all for the comfort and 
strength of the poor, stupid little crowd, his people. For 
where God is once angry and punishes, the human heart 
cannot forget it, is always afraid of it, and thinks that God 
wants to be angry forever in such a way that it trembles 
even before a rustling leaf, and is worried that heaven 
will fall on it. Again, if he is benevolent and merciful, the 
human heart becomes so sure and hardened that it 
thinks it will go on forever, and even if thunderbolts 
threaten it, it does not think that it is due to its own 
iniquity. Therefore he gives a sign of his grace that 
Christ's kingdom will surely come and bring such 
security, and says: 


V. 9, 10: And the word of the LORD came unto me, 
saying, Take of them that were carried away captives, 
even of Heldai, and of Tobiah, and of Jedaiah, and 
come the same day, and enter into the house of Josiah 
the son of Zephaniah, which came from Babylon. 


(16) Now that the visions are all finished, he gives a 
sign beside the word of the promise of the gospel to 
come, as it is the custom of all prophets to give a sign 
beside the word, and to hang on it like the word. Thus did 
Isaiah Cap. 20, 3. 4. when he went naked, for a sign that 
the king of Assyria should spoil the land of Egypt. And 
Jeremiah (Cap. 27, 2. ff.) wore a wooden chain on his 
neck. 





when he proclaimed tyranny to all the nations of the king 
of Babylon. In the same way, Noah was given the 
rainbow as a sign [Gen. 9:13, 14], and Abraham was 
given circumcision 2c. [Gen. 17, 10. f.) But to us 
Christians the baptism and the sacrament 2c. So also 
here a sign of the two crowns is given to the Jews to 
confirm the prophecy of the gospel, which is indicated by 
the face of the chariots, so that they should be sure that 
henceforth the Persians and their enemies would no 
longer plague them, but that the kingdom and priesthood 
of Christ would be most definitely in the future, through 
which they would be completely free and secure from all 
enemies for eternity. 


V. 11 Take silver and gold and make two crowns 
and put them on the head of Joshua the high priest, 
the son of Jehozadak. 


(17) Now this is the sign, that is, to put two crowns, 
not on the head of Zerubbabel the secular prince, but on 
the head of Joshua the priest. Neither are they given to 
Joshua as his own, nor are they commanded to be worn 
or used, but that only by placing them on his head a sign 
may be given, and then they may be hung up in the 
temple as a memorial to strengthen their faith in the 
future Christ, the true king and priest. But whether both 
crowns were of gold mixed with silver, or whether only 
one was gold and the other silver, | do not know; the text 
stands there, and says that he should take silver and 
gold, so | leave it at that. 

(18) And it is enough that by the two crowns are 
signified to us the two regiments of Christ, that he should 
be priest and king, not after a worldly manner, but 
spiritually, in faith. Which he indicates by placing the 
crowns not on the prince Zerubbabel, but on the high 
priest Joshua, the spiritual person. Also that then the 
priesthood should be higher than the principality. For 
Christ, through his priesthood, sacrifices himself for us, 
and represents and reconciles us before God; but 
through his kingdom or principality, he forcibly shields us 
from the devil, death, sin and all evil, and rules us as his 
heir and kingdom in spirit and faith. 


1878 Erl. 42, 250-L53. 


019 And this also is a special comfort, that the 
prophet is commanded to take such gold and silver 
nowhere, but of the Jews, and of such Jews as were 
captives at Babylon. That he might show that Christ 
was to come of the very blood of those Jews who had 
been captives, that they should fear no more, but be 
sure of all that this prophecy and sign promises. The 
names of these men are not found in the book of 
Ezra, except for the two, Jedaiah and Tobiah, though 
no one knows if they are the same. But | reckon that 
half of them were of the tribe of Judah, and half of 
them of the priestly tribe. And that this sign or 
crowning was not done in the house of Joshua the 
high priest, but in the house of another, Josiah the 
son of Zephaniah, | consider to mean that Christ's 
priesthood and kingdom should be different from the 
Levitical priesthood, and should also come among 
the Gentiles, and not remain among the Jews alone. 


V.12. 13. And say unto him, Thus saith the LORD of 
hosts; Behold, there is a man whose name is Zemah; 
for under him shall it grow to build the temple of the 
LORD: for he shall build the temple of the LORD, and 
shall bear the ornament, and shall sit and reign in his 
throne, and shall be priest also in his throne, and shall 
be a stopper of peace between the two. 


20 Here he himself interprets the sign with the two 

crowns. For this text may not be understood of 
Joshua, because here both crowns, that is, the 
dominion and priesthood, are appointed to one 
person, that he should possess both seats or 
thrones," at the same time, be both king and priest, 
which happened to no one in the old priesthood, but 
only to the one man, our Lord Jesus Christ. For 
though in the days of the Maccabees the temporal 
rule came by accident to the priests, yet no kingdom 
or lasting dominion ever came of it. 
21. but here he also calls Christ Zemah, as in the 
third chapter above, v. 8, and that the same therefore 
(he says) that under him shall grow, that is, it shall 
continue and succeed, what he does, although all the 
world, including the gates. 


Interpretations on the Prophets. W. VI. 3447-3450. 


1879 


of the hells, set themselves against it. For Zemah 
[XXX] is the name of a plant or little branch that grows 
into a great tree. For Christ was at first a little shrub 
or plant in the land of Judah, but afterward he grew 
until he became a tree, filling the whole world with his 
branches, reaching with his top to heaven and with 
his root to the abyss of hell, for he has it all in his 
hands, Ps. 8:7, Eph. 2:21. 

22 But notice here that he does not designate a 
place for this Zemah. For he does not say that he will 
be at Jerusalem, and there build the temple of the 
Lord, but "under him" (he says), that is, where he will 
be, where his place will be, there it will grow. Now he 
is not in one place, but in all the world, through the 
gospel; therefore it is a spiritual growth, and cannot 
be understood of the priesthood at Jerusalem. But it 
grows spiritually under him. For bodily it looks much 
different, because under Christ the cross, 
persecution and death are mighty. Nevertheless it 
grows, and there it is not hindered at all, but much 
more promoted. And when he says that "the temple 
of the Lord should be built by him", he publicly states 
that there should be a much different temple than the 
two, Joshua and Zerubbabel, are now building, 
namely a spiritual one. For this spiritual temple is to 
be built by the one person who will be both king and 
priest. 

(23) And he shall "wear the ornament. For the 
priestly garments are called praise and adornment in 
Exodus 28:2 ff, because they make those who are 
clothed with them honorable, honest and beautiful. 
But as the temple here is to be spiritual, so also the 
adornment of this priest and king must be spiritual, 
as Ps. 104, 1. 2. speaks of God: "Thou hast put on 
praise and adornment"; and Ps.8, 6. before: Christo: 
"You have crowned him with praise and adornment", 
or surrounded. Although under the pope the Jewish 
bodily adornment remained. But this spiritual 
adornment is interpreted Ps. 132, 9. where it says: 
"Let your priests be clothed with righteousness, and 
your consecrated rejoice." So now this priest's 
adornment is righteousness, that is all virtues, as 
love, faithfulness, joy, peace, and summa, as St. Paul 
Tit. 1, 7. ff. 


1880 Erl. 42, 253-255. interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 6, 12-15. 


W. VI, 3450-3453. 1881 





1 Tim. 3, 2. ff.] and 2 Tim. 4, 5. tells that a bishop should 
be adorned and skillful, so that he may be blameless, 
that is, just in all things. 

024 This priest shall be a lord and prince upon his 
throne, and also a priest upon his throne. There is, as 
above 

[It has been proved strongly enough that this may not 
be understood of Joshua, but only of Christ, because 
both offices are to be held by one person. And he says 
finely: "He shall reign on his throne, and be priest on his 
throne", as if he had his own throne, that he is not priest 
on Aaron's or Moses' throne, and will not reign on 
Zerubbabel's throne, but on his own throne, that all 
things shall be another priesthood, another reign, than 
Joshua and Zerubbabel. 

25. And that he saith, "Let there be an agreement or 
counsel of peace between the two," not between 
Zerubbabel and Joshua, but between the two, that is, 
between the priesthood and the princedom, which have 
been at times contrary and divided, being of two persons 
and families, as when the kings persecuted the priests, 
as we read in the books of the kings, one going out this 
way, and the other going out that way; When one gave 
such counsel, the other gave another, and there was no 
peaceable, unanimous opinion. But now that both have 
come together in one person, things will henceforth 
proceed in a friendly and unanimous manner, so that no 
unruly advice or two-fold conceit will come between 
them, but as he represents us before God, so he also 
governs us on earth. But in the time of kings, the priests 
often represented the people before God in an entirely 
divine manner, and yet the kings ruled the people in an 
entirely idolatrous manner, and again. 


V.14. And the crowns shall be for the memorial of 
Helem, and of Tobiah, and of Jedaiah, and of Hen the 
son of Zephaniah, in the temple of the LORD. 


26 Here Helem is called, who is called Heldai above 
[v. 10], and Hen, who is called Josiah above. For it is 
the scriptural custom that one person has two or three 
names, just as St. Peter is called Simon, and Bar Jonah 
and Cephas [Matth. 16, 18. Marc. 3, 16. Matth. 16, 17. 
Joh. 1, 42]. 





But what such names mean does not concern me much; 
it is enough that according to the text these two crowns 
should be hung up in the temple as a sign of the future 
promise and in memory of these four men, so that it 
should be said among the descendants: "Behold, these 
two crowns were made by these four men in the time of 
the prophet Zechariah, as a sign and confirmation of the 
prophecy of the future kingdom of Christ, which was to 
begin because this new temple was still standing and the 
crowns were inside. According to this example, many 
other precious jewels were given and hung in the temple 
at Jerusalem, as the apostles testify (Matt. 24:1), when 
they showed the Lord Jesus the building and the jewels 
of the temple. As we also see in the temples that were 
founded under the pope. But there is no command of 
God; so they are not there for any sign, but only for 
splendor and hope, neither useful for love nor for faith. 
But these two crowns served to strengthen the faith of 
the Jewish people in the future Christ and his kingdom. 


V. 15, And shall come from afar, which shall hew at 
the temple of the LORD. 


(27) This, in my understanding, is said of the temple 
of Christ, and not of the fleshly temple at Jerusalem. For 
although many small things were given to the temple at 
Jerusalem by many Gentiles, it was built by the Jews 
alone through Zerubbabel and Joshua, as he says above 
[Cap. 4:9]: "The hands of Zerubbabel laid the foundation, 
his hands also shall finish it" 2c. So then all the bishops 
and teachers among the Gentiles who preach and keep 
the gospel correctly have built and are still building the 
temple of Christ, that is, holy Christendom. For these 
come from far away, because they are not of the Jewish 
blood, who are the nearest and Christ's own friends. 


Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent 
me to you. 


28Then you and your descendants will know by deed 
and experience that | have been a true prophet, and that 
my prophecy about these horses is true. 


1882 en. 42, 255-857. Interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3453-3456. 


1883 





and chariot is true, for at that time it will stand fulfilled 
and walk before your eyes, which you now hardly 
believe, and only cling to the fleshly temple, and seek 
the outward rule. 


And this shall come to pass, if ye will obey the voice 
of the LORD your God. 
29 This is the gloss of the whole chapter. It is 
necessary, he says, that you believe the future 
gospel that your God will preach to you. If then you 
believe, you will also understand me in this prophecy, 
and you will know that God has given me these 
things. 


But if you do not believe, you will understand none of 
them, and understand nothing everywhere, neither of 
the Zemah, nor of his rule and priesthood and 
temple, but will remain stubborn and blinded to this 
fleshly temple and priesthood, and let those go, yes, 
even persecute them. And with this the prophet 
touches, and gives to understand, how the Jews 
would not accept the gospel and Christ; for in no 
other chapter does he give such an exhortation to 
obey the voice of God, as in this, when he prophesies 
of Christ and his kingdom. 


The seventh chapter. 


V. 1. And it came to pass in the fourth year of king 
Darm, that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah 
in the fourth day of the ninth month, which is called 
Chislev. 


So far the prophet has preached for two years and 
brought the people back to the right faith, comforting 
them that they should be safe from their enemies from 
the north, because two chariots are to go there to 
bring the Spirit of God through the gospel, as well as 
to all the world. Now, however, there is a case or 
question of self-chosen good works, so that one may 
see how there is nothing to suffer apart from the word 
of God; and such a question must come, because the 
prophet is still alive and teaches, so that it may be 
publicly and powerfully condemned, as an example 
that all our works, which we choose, however good 
they may seem, are of no use, and only the pure word 
of God is to be adhered to. For this plague is attached 
to all human doctrines, that it makes God's 
commandment void or low, and makes itself high and 
great, as we shall see here in this example. The Jews 
begin the year in March around their Easter, 
according to which the ninth moon is with them, which 
we call the winter moon, and they in Hebrew Chislev. 


V. 2.3 When Sarezer and Regemmelech and their 
men sent to Bethlehem, 1) to make supplication before 
the LORD, and to tell the priests that were about the 
house of the LORD of hosts, and the prophets: Shall | 
also weep in the fifth month, and faint, 2) as | have 
done these things many years? 


(2) Four fasts are reported in this chapter, namely, 
the fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth months. Which 
fasts the Jews had accepted, and chosen and 
imposed upon themselves, because of four great 
calamities (as they say) that had befallen them. For 
in the fourth month the city of Jerusalem was taken 
by the Babylonians and starved out, and abandoned 
by the contentious citizens, Jer. 52, 6. but in the fifth 
month the temple, castle and whole city were burned, 
2 Kings 25, 9. and in the seventh month the centurion 
Gedaliah 3) was strangled, and the people were 
brought into Egypt, 2 Kings 25, 25. In the tenth month 
the people of Egypt were killed. 


1) At that time, Luther did not take Beth-El from the temple, but 
from the idol place Beth-El, so that first to Beth-El had been sent, but 
only afterwards to Jerusalem. Compare the following relation. 

2) That is, to practice strict discipline, to mortify the body. In Latin: 
udstinodo ----- fast. Luther himself gives the explanation of this word 
in tz 3. 

3) In the original and in the editions: Godolias. 


1884 Erl. 42, 2S7-S59. Interpretation of Zechariah (1,), 


But such a rumor and lamentation was brought to 
Babylon to the captive Jews who were there, and it 
was proclaimed, Ezek. 33:21 So these people ask, 
because the temple is being rebuilt, whether they 
should continue fasting for the fifth moon or stop? For 
they had vowed and taken it for a commandment; 
therefore we must here again speak of vows and laws. 

(3) And they show two things: one, that they 
fasted; the other, that they chastened, that is, 
abstained from good morsels, and sweet meat and 
drink, especially from wine and strong drink, as 
Numbers 6:3 and following. is written of the discipline, 
according to which law and example they had 
accepted such discipline and avoidance of wine, just 
as they had accepted fasting according to the 
example of the seventh moon, as Moses says in the 
Feast of Atonement, Deut. 16, 29. ff. Now see here, 
fasting and discipline are good and not evil works, 
accepted for no evil cause, for which they were 
praised and commanded among the Jews; but hear 
how God rejects and condemns them, saying: 


v.4-6. And the word of the LORD of hosts came 

unto me, saying, Tell all the people of the land, and the 
priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the 
fifth and seventh month, these seventy years, did ye 
fast unto me? Or when ye did eat and drink, did ye not 
eat and drink for yourselves? 
(4) Is not this an unreasonable thing, that God should 
so utterly reject such fasting and discipline? saying, It 
is not his business, nor is it done for his service or 
honor; yea, he esteems both their eating and fasting 
alike, saying, They have indeed fasted and eaten, but 
for themselves, and not for his service. As if to say, 
Why do you tempt me with your fasting? Who 
commanded you? What do | ask of your fasting and 
eating? What does your fasting and eating help or 
serve me? If you do not want to eat, do not; if you want 
to fast, do it, so far that you know how | do not ask 
anything about it. Cause: it is not my fasting, | have 
not commanded it, nor commanded it; therefore | 
neither require it, nor respect it; he that commanded it 
you, or he that was commanded it of you. 





Cap. 7, 2-6. W. VI, 3456-3459. 1885 

If anyone has asked you to do it, you must do it and 
hold it against him. But you chose it for yourselves 
without my commandment, so you did it to no one but 
yourselves; so you may also take the reward from 
yourselves. Whom you have served with it, let him 
reward you. You did not serve me with it, so | do not 
give anything to it. 

(5) And in this text the little word "to me" and the 
little word "to you" are to be paid attention to. For with 
the two he separates the commandments of men 
from the commandments of God. To me, to me you 
have done none of these things, why? Because | 
have not commanded you any. But to you, to you you 
have done it. Why? Because you have thought it out 
and chosen it for yourselves, and so it has pleased 
you. In the same way they lament Is 58:3: "Why have 
we fasted, and you have not considered it? We have 
humbled our souls, and you do not recognize it?" And 
Jer. 7:21, 22, he says to them, "Make your burnt 
offerings your sacrifices, and eat flesh: for | spake not 
unto your fathers, neither commanded | them, when 
| brought them out of Egypt, concerning burnt 
offerings and sacrifices. 

(6) Then we hear again that God does not want all 
that He Himself has not commanded, as many more 
of the same sayings are found in both the New and 
Old Testaments. Why is that? Because, as has been 
said, all works and commandments that God has 
chosen for Himself are a plague and a heartache to 
us, because they are more pleasing to us than what 
God has commanded; we also pay more attention to 
them and do them much more diligently than to God's 
commandments. Which is why God is extremely and 
justly perverse, so that He also despises and rejects 
our own work and commandments, just as we 
despise His commandments and works. 

(7) For behold here these men who send their 
message from Babylon, and make the priests ask 
what perverse, blasphemous holiness they 
denounce. They do not ask about God's 
commandment and what they should do or not do to 
keep God's law. Oh, they know all this in Babylon 
itself better than all the priests and prophets in 
Jerusalem. They do not send out a dog for this 
purpose, nor do they send a lighter messenger 
across a street to ask for it; all this has been done, 


1886 Erl. 42, SS9-261. Interpretations on the prophets 


. W. VI, 3489-346}. 1887 





and there is nothing more to be done about it. There 
is no conscience, no fault, but pure holiness and 
complete perfection. They have gone a hundred 
thousand miles beyond what God commanded, that 
is, they have fasted and reared; but that they should 
make supplication for themselves at BethEl, and 
whether their chosen fast should go any further, there 
is care, conscience, fear and questioning time, there 
they find money and messengers, there is no work 
too much, no way too far, no diligence too hard. Isn't 
ita disagreeable, disgraceful thing? 

8 Look at our nature as well. We are commanded 

to believe in Christ and to love our neighbor, and to 
do everything we can and have. But anyone can do 
this, and it has long since been torn from his shoes; 
no one would see that he should do anything about 
it, to learn and to do, not even one lighter, not one 
step over the threshold. But to build churches. To 
establish mass, to fast for the saints, to make 
pilgrimages, to vow monastic life, to give church 
ornaments, and to keep other church laws, oh, that 
glitters, there one has money power, there one can 
fast, wear hard clothes, eat badly, watch, work, there 
one must learn and ask, toil and toil, that one may 
become pious and holy 2c. But when Christ shall 
speak at the last day, saying, Dearly beloved, when 
ye founded churches, have ye founded the same 
unto me? Who told you to do it? When did | command 
it? And when you lived obediently, chastely and 
poorly in the monastery, and kept your rule, did you 
live and keep it for me? Where did | command it? Go, 
then, and let him reward thee for whom thou hast 
lived and kept it. What will all priests, monks, nuns 
and spiritual people say to this? They must be silent, 
and yet hear that they have not only chosen and kept 
all these things for their own service and pleasure, 
but that they have also neglected and despised 
God's commandment. 
(9) Therefore Isaiah also preaches against such 
perverse Fastelers and saints, as was said [§ 5], who 
also let the commandments of God stand, and 
wanted to have everything done with fasting and 
souring, and thus says: "You may ask me what is 
right", and want to become God, and say: "Why do 
we fast, and you do not look at it? 


Why do we fast our souls, and you do not respect his? 
Behold, in the day of your fasting your will is found, 
and you press on, all your debtors. Behold, ye fast, 
that ye reason, and strive, and smite with fists 
ungodly. Fast not so as now, lest a cry be heard from 
you on high. Is this the fasting | mean, when a man 
chastises his soul in the daytime, and binds up his 
head like a bundle of straw, and makes his bed in the 
dust and ashes? Should this be called a fasting day, 
and a pleasant day of the Lord? But this is a fast that 
| choose: Loose the ungodly bands, and unloose the 
heavy burdens, and set free them that are bruised, 
and tear off every burden. Break thy bread for the 
hungry, and shelter the poor beggars. Where you see 
one naked, clothe him, and do not strip yourself of 
your flesh" 2c. 

010 Behold, these great saints left unchristian 
bonds and burdens upon their neighbor, that is, they 
oppressed the poor, dealing with them by justice and 
severity, without all mercy. And in addition they 
showed no good to their neighbors, and went to and 
fasted in the meantime, and covered their heads, and 
lay on a hard bed, and looked sour, and hurt their 
bodies with all kinds of hard living. That is why they 
should look at God, defy Him, and argue with God, 
asking why He is so unjust that He does not respect 
such holiness? and want to teach Him 1) what is right 
and holy. So he answers again that fasting is right 
when we forgive our neighbors and let up on the 
unchristian way in which they are burdened by us, 
and also do good and help them. He who does this 
fasts well, even if he is always eating and drinking. 
But he who does not, does not fast, if he already lives 
by the wind. But we can easily fast and live hard, but 
to help and serve our neighbor, to forgive and forbear, 
that will never go away. Why? Well, that is our thing, 
our choice, our pleasure. But this is God's 
commandment, therefore it does not apply. 

11 For this reason, Isaiah also calls such pieces 


"colligantia" impias et fascicu-. 





1) In the original: learn. 


1888 En. 12, Lél-L64. Interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 7, 4-10. 


W. VI, 3461-3464. 1889 





Loose the ungodly bonds or knots. For what we lay 
on our neighbor is tightly bound and tied together; we 
do not like to let up, but would much rather make the 
burden and burdens greater, and tie them more 
tightly, so that the neighbor may have to go, and not 
be released, but pay, and do what he owes, or thus 
remain bound and entangled and weighed down, the 
longer the more. That is what he means here ungodly 
bonds and burdens that are hard loaded and tied on 
2c. 

12 Thus we see how one's own works with their 
appearance completely nullify the commandments of 
God, and in addition create a presumption in the 
heart that wants to be right with God and insist as if it 
must look at God or should be wrong; that Paul says 
Titus 1:14.2 Thess. 2, 4. says that the Antichrist 
exalts himself above God and above God's service, 
no doubt through his own holiness; and Christ Matth. 
15, 3. testifies that the Jews have lifted up God's 
commandment, so that they might keep men's 
statutes. 

(13) We see this also in the hostile monastic life 
and spiritual state: there is fasting, feasting, hard 
lying, vigilance, silence, wearing sharp clothes, being 
shorn and decided, 1) living without marriage, of 
which God has commanded nothing. But 
nevertheless they devour land and people with their 
interest and goods, flay the people to the legs; there 
is neither love nor mercy; they do not work, but 
nevertheless consume the blood and sweat of the 
poor; those who do not have the bread in the Hanse, 
they must feed their bellies with all abundance, work 
day and night 2c. Would they also like to be called 


impiae colligantiae et fasciculi jugi? Nevertheless, 
they insist on it and wait for God to crown them for 
special saints; if not, he will have to be wrong and 
hear: We have fasted, and you will not look at it! We 
live hard and spiritually, and you do not respect it! 2c. 
But it is our choice, that is why it will come to nothing. 
God wants His commandments to be kept, and we 
have enough to keep them. 

14. over that, so these men still have 

1) "decided", that is, included. In Latin: in dausis vizrsari. 





They have a bad habit of sending to Bethlehem to 
pray, but to Jerusalem they send for counsel. So they 
divide their holiness into two parts: they worship at 
Beth El, at the place where it was always forbidden 
by the former prophets, and at that time the king of 
Babylon had put Samaritans and all kinds of peoples, 
each of whom worshipped his god, as the book of 
Chronicles describes in Cap. 36, that BethEl had to 
be both the house of the Lord and the house of the 
idols, ordained by the choice of men. Thus the 
doctrine of men always does, that it follows men's 
own goodwill, or at least mixes it in, so that the dough 
does not remain unleavened; although the prophet 
here does not primarily drive this bad habit, but rather 
their chosen fasting, by which they slackened and 
despised God's commandment. 


V. 7. Is it not this which the Lord preached by the 
former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited, and 
had abundance with her cities round about, and people 
dwelling, both at noon and in reason? 


015 As if to say, | have forbidden such works and 
services of my own choosing ever since Jerusalem 
stood, and they are distressed because they would 
not obey me; and yet ye, being in the midst of the 
same punishment, let not yourselves be separated, 
remaining always in your mind, and correcting 
yourselves nothing. What should you do if Jerusalem 
were still standing, and you dwelt in peace, as your 
fathers did, if such great punishment could not yet 
subdue you or make you understand? And this also 
is one of virtue, which have the doctrines of men, that 
they suffer them not to be told: and as St. Paul Titus 
1:16 testifieth of them, they are immovable, and not 
able to any good work, because they obey not, which 
is lost: but what they think and do is right and good. 


V. 8-10 And the word of the LORD came unto 
Zechariah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, 
Judge aright, and shew kindness and mercy every man 
to his brother; and do not wrong the widow, the 
fatherless, the stranger, or the poor; neither think evil 
in his heart against his brother.

1891 





(16) These, saith he, were the sermons which | 
preached by the former prophets. There is no fasting, 
nor discipline, nor any other work of conceit, which 
they chose for themselves, but only good works of 
love toward their neighbor. They left all these things 
undone, and regarded them as nothing, and in the 
meantime they began and grew, and led a hard and 
severe life, as they pleased. | should look upon the 
same, and forsake my commandments, and despise 
them as they did. | commanded the kings, princes 
and priests to judge aright, that they might wait upon 
their office, that they might be instructed, that there 
might be peace and protection in the land. They failed 
to do so, and judged unjustly, abusing their office for 
violence, so that there was lamentation, strife and 
clamor in the land; Then they came with their fasting, 
sacrifices, sour, austere lives, and wanted to be holy 
with them, and adorn and cover all iniquity, as if | 
were a child or a fool, who would let myself be 
mocked with pennies for gold, so that | would accept 
their rotten, brazen works, and leave my gold works 
and commandments behind, and become a knave 
with them, and put up with such _ their 
mischievousness. 

(17) In the same way, | commanded everyone in 
general to be kind and merciful to one another, to 
give, to lend, to give advice, to help anyone who was 
in need. But that was nothing, it had to be a small 
thing. Each sought his own, and left his neighbor in 
need, no one took care of the other. But in the 
meantime they sacrificed and fasted, or did 
something else, so that they would not have to do 
these commandments of mine. And | should laugh at 
them and be merciful. 

Item 18: | commanded that the widows, orphans, 
strangers and the miserable should not be offended. 
Not only did they do them no good, but again, all 
suffering and injustice, only that they might be rich 
and full. And so they came with their fasting and 
praying, and their gray, black garments, and they 
looked sour. Such their babbling and hypocrisy 
should deceive me, that | should think them holy, and 
not require my commandments. 

019 Item, | commanded that they should be 
peaceable and patient among themselves, if anyone 
did anything. 


Let it be done by the evil one, that he may forgive, 
and not avenge, nor repay evil with evil, nor curse 
with curse, nor backbite, nor slander; but all this must 
be nothing, a fool must have commanded it. Fools 
would be the ones who kept it. So it was that every 
man was an enemy to his neighbor, bearing eternal 
hatred and envy against him, and where he could do 
harm and avenge himself, or otherwise prove 
wickedness, hinder his benefit, or yet not prevent his 
harm, all this was right, and need not be sin. Why? 
Because they sacrificed to me till and anise, and 
burned incense to me, or slept once a week on a hard 
bed, or ate no meat on Wednesday, and such like 
trickery. 

20 Therefore, see if all this has not been a 
grievous thing, that one so shamefully despises 
God's commandment and makes one's own works so 
glorious. This is exactly how it has been with us up to 
now, and still is, both in the spiritual and in the 
temporal government. There was no law, but vain 
tyranny. Popes and bishops warred and shed blood, 
but in return they offered about one mass or seven 
prayers. 1) The world was full of usury and fraud, but 
in return they lit a wax candle or two at St. Anne's and 
fasted St. Barbara and Catharine. The monks and 
nuns were full of hatred and envy, and ate the world's 
goods with pleasure; but for this they wore caps, and 
howled in the choir day and night. So it goes on 
forever: what God gives is nothing; what we do is 
everything, which God shall look upon and be 
satisfied with. If God were not so unspeakably 
merciful and let His wrath pass over us justly, what 
wonder would it be if we were plagued daily by 
pestilence, war, the time of trouble, the French, 
sudden death and all kinds of misfortune? Should the 
earth swallow us up, that we want to make a fool of 
God, because we do and leave everything that 
disturbs him, and in the meantime do other things that 
please us, and still do not want to hear nor suffer that 
it should be said to us, as follows: 

1) In Latin: soptom Korns, ut voonut. 


2) Erlanger: Stift, Pfaffen. Both the Wittenberg and the Jena have 
our reading.

V. ii. 012 But they would not hearken, but taught 
their backs to be turned away, and hardened their 
ears, that they hearkened not; and set their hearts like 
unto demons, that they hearkened not unto the law 
and word, which the LORD of hosts sent in his spirit 
by the former prophets. 


How evenly he paints them with their virtues, and how 
horribly he makes the doctrine of men, that they make a 
human heart (if they win it) so blind, obdurate and hard 
against God's commandment. First, he says: "They turn 
their backs" on God's word when it is preached to them, 
that is, the more it is said, the more they turn away from 


it and go their own way, as it says here in Hebrew: et 


dederunt dorsum declinationis. Secondly, "they 
harden their ears, that they will not hear". Not all: they 
do not want to do anything about it; they do not want to 
hear it either. Thirdly, "they set their hearts against it like 
demons," so that they not only do not think about it, but 
also resist and pursue it most horribly. There is no harder 
and firmer thing than a demon, which no iron or stone 
can force or tame. 

(22) Behold now, in our time, the clergy of the 
pontifical church with their attachments, as they stand at 
their fairs and works of men. | mean, you will also have 
to say that their hearts are vain, their ears hardened, and 
their backs turned. How clearly, brightly and powerfully 
they hear God's word against them, it does not help, it is 
as if a goose were whistling at them, if they cannot deny 
that their life is vain avarice, hopefulness, pride, 
laziness, idleness, fornication and unmercifulness to the 
poor; but the plates and shirts, chasubles and masses 
will make all this bad against God and acquire heaven, 
hard by Lucifer, in the abyss of hell. 


V. 13. 14. Therefore such great wrath came from the 
LORD of hosts, and so it came to pass, like 





as was preached, and they hearkened not: neither 
would | hearken when they cried, saith the LORD of 
hosts. So | have scattered them among all the nations 
that know them not, and the land behind them is left 
desolate, that no man walketh therein, neither dwelleth 
therein; and the noble land is made desolate. 


(23) Hard against hard is not good; two hard stones 
do not grind together. God's commandment is hard, yes, 
it must remain forever; whoever sets himself against it 
and wants to be hard against hard, it will certainly not go 
well for him; but if he does not give way, he will be 
broken and crushed into vain pieces, yes, into vain dust, 
as he says here, that the hard Jews, as the demons, 
were also broken and crushed over their hardness in all 
the earth, and it did not help them that they cried and 
prayed for mercy and grace. For they did not desist from 
their hard hearts, always remaining on their own works, 
despising God's word. 

24 For the fact that God says here that He would not 
hear when they called is not to be understood that He 
would not hear when one calls, for He is called in time of 
need, as He says Ps. 50:15: "Call upon Me in time of 
need, and | will help thee, and thou shalt praise Me" 2C, 
but this is to be understood, that where we do not hear 
his commandment, neither does he hear our prayer; and 
as we oppose and harden his commandments, and 
persecute them, so he also opposes and persecutes our 
prayer, that it must be sin, as the 109th Psalm, v. 7, says: 
"Let his prayer be sin." But those who accept God's 
commandment or confess their sin, their prayer is 
certainly answered. But those who want to be right and 
not let their sin be sin. They also pray, and call in vain in 
their distress, as the 18th Psalm, v. 42, also says: "They 
call, but there is no helper; to the Lord, but he hears them 
not."

The eighth chapter. 


(vv. 1-3) And the word of the LORD came unto me, 
saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; | have been 
almost very jealous over Zion, and have been jealous 
over her in great wrath. Thus saith the LORD of hosts; 
| will return unto Zion, and will dwell in Jerusalem: and 
Jerusalem shall be called a faithful city, and the 
mountain of the LORD of hosts a holy mountain. 


This is the last prophecy of this prophet to the Jewish 
people to build the temple. For after he had punished the 
wicked saints, as an example, that they should not do so 
again, lest they should think that there should be more 
wrath behind, and make them stupid and afraid, he 
comforted them further, and promised them abundantly, 
how they should not only have peace from their enemies 
round about, but that it should be well again in all the 
land, and that Jerusalem should be a mighty and famous 
city, full of people and goods 2c., in all safety and peace 
for ever, until Christ's coming. Therefore this whole 
chapter is full of sweet, kind words, that he may describe 
how peace shall be made. 

(2) For the first time there shall be forgiveness of sins, 
and the wrath of God shall be at an end, because he 
saith, | have been almost angry with Zion. For where 
there is still wrath, there is no peace in the heart; the 
conscience is stupid and despondent, that [it] can do 
nothing. For sins still press upon it, because it feels no 
forgiveness. 

3) On the other hand, such forgiveness and grace 
shall be proven by the deed, when he says: "I return to 
Zion"; henceforth there shall be peace and laughter, joy 
and gladness in the heart, and the conscience shall be 
secure and confident in God's grace [Rom. 5:1], so that 
it can also clench with pleasure and do what it is 
commanded. 

4 Thirdly, such grace shall not cease, but abide and 
continue at Jerusalem, saying, | will dwell at Jerusalem. 
For if God is with us, who can be against Him? [Rom. 8, 
31.] And what harm can sin, death, the world, and 





Devil, where God dwells? Must not all angels also be 
there and serve, and help to manage such peace and 
bliss? 

005 Fourthly, the fruit and profit of this tabernacle and 
grace shall appear, that it shall be glorious in spiritual 
things, saying, Jerusalem shall be called a faithful city, 
and the mountain of the Lord a holy mountain: that is, 
there shall be no idolatry, nor hypocrisy, nor unholiness 
therein, as before; but there shall be truth and 
faithfulness, that the doctrine may be right and godly; and 
that the service of God in mount Moriah [1 Bi. 22:2], that 
is, in the temple, shall also be righteous, pure, and holy. 
For the people will be faithful and devout, shunning the 
doctrine of men and idolatry, clinging only to God's word, 
thereby becoming holy and faithful, that is, righteously 
devout, without all hypocrisy. 

For where God dwells, there is God's Word and Spirit 
(as is often said). Where God's Word and Spirit are, there 
it makes holy and righteous people, both with teachings 
and life, so that [it] also breaks out among many others, 
and the city becomes famous from it, for the example of 
many others, as he says here, that Jerusalem shall be 
called a faithful city, or a city of truth, that is, in German, 
it is to be famous, as it is right and honest in it, and not 
false hypocrisy or deceit is in it, as it happens, where 
man's teaching rules, without God's word or next to 
God's word. 


Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet dwell 
in the streets of Jerusalem old men and old women, 
that walk with staves before their great age. And the 
streets of the city shall be full of babes and maidens 
playing out of the streets. 

(7) Fifthly, temporal benefits also, that it may be 
glorious in time and in body, saying, Jerusalem shall be 
full of people, both young and old. But this cannot be 
where there is war and strife. 


1896 Eni. 4s, s70-s7s. Interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 8, 4-8. 


W. VI, 3473-3476. 1897 





as the young crew is slain, and there is not much 
playing or dancing in the streets. It must be good in 
the country where the children in the city jump, dance 
and play in the streets, and the old people live and 
walk safely. 

(8) And let us note here what a great gift is 
temporal peace in the land, that God Himself praises 
such a gift who gives it, and we, alas, do not give 
thanks for it, nor recognize it. 

(9) Notice also how the work of children, as the 
playing and dancing of the young world in the streets, 
is not an evil thing, but pleases God, that he also 
praises it here for his gift, and yet seems to us to be 
a lost and useless thing. The monasteries and 
convents should give half of their goods and sanctity, 
so that their nature and works would have half as 
much testimony in the Scriptures; how will they stand 
when Christ will say that the children's singing and 
dancing in the streets is dearer to him than all their 
howling and grumbling in their churches [Matth. 11, 
17], and that the wreaths and dolls of the maidens, 
the horsebit and red slits of the babes, are much 
more pleasing to him than all their caps, plates, 
shirts, chasubles and ornaments? For even though 
such a thing of theirs is also a child's play, since it is 
without God's word, it is not to be compared to that 
child's play, but rather to a monkey's play and fool's 
work. 


V. 6 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Thinketh it 

impossible in the sight of the remnant of the people at 
this time; shall it be impossible in mine eyes also? 
saith the LORD of hosts. 
(10) Here he comes before your unbelief, which, 
when it hears such a great, glorious promise, and yet 
looks at the present, as it rhymes with nothing at all, 
and is not at all like it, it considers it an impossible 
thing. Therefore he wants to establish such unbelief 
here, which he does by calling them to close their 
eyes and not to look at the present, but to pay 
attention only to his word, which is greater than all 
the present. As if to say: You must not pay attention 
to your thoughts or conceits, but to me and my word. 
Your conceit 





He puts his eyes on the present, and because he 
sees the city so desolate, and neither young nor old 
people are found playing and making merry in it, but 
rather there is all weeping and mourning, and the city 
still lies in ashes, the enemies still rage and rage 
around, so that neither peace nor commerce can be, 
he thinks it is in vain and all is lost, and not at all 
possible; but if you look to me alone, you must 
confess that before me no thing is impossible. 
Behold, what is the cost of raising up and comforting 
a silly, frightened heart, that it may become strong in 
faith, and how tender, soft, noble a thing it is for a 
conscience, how easily it is corrupted, and so hard to 
heal. 


Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, | will redeem 
my people from the going forth of the land, and from 
the going down of the sun. And | will bring them to 
dwell in Jerusalem. And they shall be my people, and 
| will be their God in truth and righteousness. 


011 This is a confirmation of the next promise, 
saying, It seemeth impossible unto you what | now 
promise, because ye are so few, and so stiffnecked: 
but my word shall come to pass. For | will and am 
able to do much for you, namely, | will bring both my 
people from the going up and going down, where 
they are captives and scattered, and they shall dwell 
at Jerusalem; there they shall be my people, and | will 
be their God in truth and righteousness; that is, they 
shall serve me in right faith and life, and | will prove 
myself again to be a right God with grace and help; 
and | will not be their judge in wrath and punishment, 
as has happened until now, since they also would not 
be my people in truth and righteousness. 

12. and notice here the two words: "in truth and 
righteousness". For God does not like the hypocrite, 
nor does he want to be the God of the wicked, who 
would like him to be a God in riches and honor, that 
is, to make them rich and glorious in the sight of the 
world, so that piety and righteousness would remain 
where they will. No, he is not amammon or belly god. 
He wants to be a God 


1898 Erl. 4S, S7S-S75. Interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3476-3479. 


| will be in truth and righteousness, and | will have a 
people who love truth and righteousness. But 
temporal good shall come, as will follow. 

13. "Truth" means that they are righteous toward 
God, and not hypocrites, as those who serve God 
with right faith and earnestness. "Righteousness" 
here means love and mercy, so that they do right 
toward their neighbor. In which two pieces is the 
whole life of a holy people. 


V.9 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Strengthen your 
hands, ye that hear these words at this time by the 
mouth of the prophets, in the day that the foundation 
of the LORD'S house is laid, that the temple may be 
built. 


14 This is an exhortation and a comfort. As if to 
say, "Because you have heard such a precious 
promise through the prophets, be of good cheer, and 
approach it freshly and cheerfully, with full faith. So 
the prophet does not teach by promise alone what is 
to come to pass, but also provokes and awakens 
them to believe the same promise. And so that they 
will not think again: Yes, all that the prophets 
proclaim may be true, and Jerusalem may become 
such a city as they say; but who knows when it shall 
come to pass, whether it shall be delayed yet longer, 
as it hath been forty years? and who knows whether 
we also shall be the ones to do it, or whether our 
descendants alone shall do it? Just as they say in 
Haggai [Cap. 1, 2], "It is not yet time to build the 
house of the Lord." Such delusion and doubtful 
carelessness he here takes away, and says: "You, 
who now at this time hear these words of the 
prophets: | do not say of your descendants, but you, 
who are now present, to you such promises go forth, 
and you shall begin it. 


For before those days the labor of men was vain, 
and the labor of beasts was nothing, and there was no 
San from tribulation to them that went in and out; 

ut | sent all men away, every man against his 
neighbor. 
15 Thus also Haggai says [Cap. 1, 6] that it was evil 
in the land: when they had much 





1899 


When they sowed, little grew, and those who 
gathered much put it into sacks full of holes, and 
there was discord from enemies and neighbors 
everywhere, as Ezra and Nehemiah show, as 
Zechariah also indicates. Because of this, the people 
were discontented and complained that it was not yet 
time to build the temple. Here he also repeals sucha 
complaint, so that they should not make any excuse 
or obstacle, and says: it has happened as they 
complain, but it should now no longer happen; as 
follows: 


V. 11, 12: But now will | not deal with the remnant 
of this people, as in the days of old, saith the LORD of 
hosts. But they shall be seeds of peace. The vine shall 
yield her fruit, and the land shall yield her increase, 
and the heavens shall yield their dew; and | will cause 
the remnant of this people to possess all these things. 

(16) This promise of a good time is again diligently 
pointed out to the present ones who heard it at that 
time, so that they would be sure and certain that they 
had been chosen for the work and would have firm 
faith that things would be better from now on. It is all 
to build up the faith, which was very weak, because 
they were so well afflicted and martyred by all kinds 
of obstacles and misfortunes. 

(17) Although the words which he speaks here 
seem easy to us, namely, of temporal goods, of 
increase and rain, yet they were very hard for the 
Jews, because they demanded faith against so many 
temptations, and indeed they were very pious 
children who believed them; we do not believe lesser 
things now, in much lesser temptations. | say this so 
that no one will think it is a joke or a scandal where 
promises are preached in Scripture, even if they are 
about small, temporal things, they demand great, 
strong faith, and are great, strong words, just as 
these following words are great: 

V. 13 And it shall come to pass, as ye of the house 
of Judah and of the house of Israel have been a curse 
among the heathen, so will | redeem you, and ye shall 
be a blessing. Fear not, and strengthen your hands. 


1900 Erl. 42, 875-277. interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 8, 13-17. 


(18) Now there is a goodly and great promise, that it 
shall be so well with the Jews, that all the Gentiles, when 
they desire something good, shall desire it, saying, God 
grant that it may go well with thee, as with the Jews; and 
so a good and blessed saying shall come forth from 
them, as before, when they were disturbed, they were 
an evil example and saying, that whosoever would 
desire evil should say, That it may go well with thee, as 
with the Jews. 

(19) Now notice how great a thing this is, and what 
faith it takes for the Jews to believe that they will be a 
blessing, when their misfortune and misery are so great 
before their eyes that all the Gentiles make an 
abomination, an example, even a vain curse and a 
proverb of them. That is, of course, to make life out of 
death, heaven out of hell, and everything out of nothing. 
Of such a curse and blessing Moses wrote and 
prophesied much in the fifth book [Cap. 28, 15. ff], how 
they should become a curse, an example and a proverb 
to all heathens, where they would worship foreign gods. 
But he also mentions the house of Israel, and not only 
the house of Judah; not that the Israelite kingdom should 
return, which had been rejected and abandoned, but 
that many of the house of Israel joined the house of 
Judah, and adhered to Jerusalem and the temple. 


Thus saith the LORD of hosts; As | thought to do 
you evil, when your fathers provoked me to anger, 
saith the LORD of hosts, and repented not: so will | in 
these days do good to Jerusalem and to the house of 
Judah. Fear nothing. 


20 This is once again a promise of temporal goods, 
for he promises the same many times, and repeats the 
same many times, to comfort the troubled hearts. For, 
as has been said, a beaten, frightened heart is difficult 
to calm again beyond measure, so that it may show 
grace and mercy to God; therefore God must do here as 
a father does with his child when it weeps and is afraid, 
and must give many good words and often say, "Be 
silent, be silent, my dear little child," 2c. 





W. VI, 3479-3482. 1901 


Children are not to be spoiled and presumptuous in 


doing their will, as they are to be pious, follows further in 
the text: 


V. 16, 17: Now this is what you should do: Speak 
the truth one to another, and judge rightly, and make 
peace in your gates. And let no man think evil in his 
heart against his neighbor, nor love false oaths. For | 
hate all these things, saith the Lord. 


21. So that the Jews do not accept such promises of 
temporal goods, as if God wanted vassals and 
hypocrites, as if he were a mammon or belly god, or as 
if everything they do pleases him (as the presumptuous 
and wicked always do, that they accept good promises, 
and yet leave God's commandment aside; and again, 
the godly almost pay attention to the commandments, 
and hardly accept the promises), so God has to defend 
here once again, just as above, on both sides: To the 
godly with comforting promises, so that they do not 
despair, but to the wicked with strict commandments, so 
that they do not become presumptuous. For he will do us 
good, and give us plenty; but he will not draw any wicked, 
but we shall be godly, and he will be gracious. 

22 Now behold, how he doth not here speak of fasting, 
nor of eating, nor of clothing, nor of feasts, nor of 
sacrifices, nor of incense, which he would not hold his 
peace concerning, if it pleased him, because he saith, 
This is what ye ought to do; 2c. that he might refrain from 
teaching them all things that are necessary unto their 
salvation. But there is nothing in this teaching but the two 
parts, faith and love, as we have also heard above [§ 12] 
in equal parts. In the first place, they are to speak the 
truth to one another; this is what the teaching concerns. 
And although it concerns everyone, it concerns 
especially the clergy or priests, from whom the others 
are to learn that they also speak the truth. But then they 
speak and teach the truth, if they leave off the 
commandments of men, their own works, and false 
glittering worship, and teach serving God in the 


1902 En. 42, s77-s79. Interpretations on the Prophets. W. VI. 3482-3484. 


right faith and trust, without all presumption of one's 
own righteousness. 

(23) The other thing is for the secular authorities, 
namely, they shall judge rightly and make peace with 
their court or office. This is nothing else, for they must 
take good care of their office, so that there may be 
no clamor or strife in the land against them. 

(24) The third thing concerns them all together, 
that no one should think evil of the other; that is, as 
is said above [Cap. 7, § 19], they should have 
patience and love for one another, gladly forgive if 
someone offends another, not seek revenge or 
retribution, but do what is best, help and advise 
where it is necessary. 

25 Last of all, they shall not love a false oath, 
which may be understood of an oath made in the 
name of other gods. But | hold that neither shall 
deceive the other in commerce. For in commerce it 
is customary to use seals and letters, witnesses and 
oaths, and such like covenants, to confirm the faith 
of one another, as the fifteenth Psalm, v. 4, says: "He 
who swears to his neighbor and does not change it," 
that is, they should not lie or deceive one another, 
but keep faith. For this is one of the greatest 
complaints in the world, that there is no faith among 
the people; they swear and pledge so dearly, and yet 
it is all frivolity and mischievousness, that God says 
here that he hates all this and is hostile to such a 
being. And this is indeed a hostile thing, by which 
many a pious man is deceived and must perish. 


V. 18, 19: And the word of the LORD of hosts came 
unto me, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The 
fasts of the fourth, and of the fifth, and of the seventh, 
and of the tenth months, shall be for joy and gladness 
unto the house of Judah, and for glad feasts of years. 
Only love truth and peace. 

26) Here he answers the question that was 
presented in the beginning of chapter 7, chapter 1, 
[v. 3] about fasting and discipline, and says: "Only 
keep what | tell you, and let it be done. 


1) "7-" is missing in the Erlanger. 





1903 


Fasting Be Fasting. Yea, if ye keep my 
commandments, such fasts shall not alone cease 
and be ended, but because | will do so much good in 
Jerusalem, all the sorrow shall be forgotten, 
wherefore ye have chosen and kept such fasts; that 
henceforth there shall be joy unto you, when ye 
remember your fasting, and the sorrow of heart, for 
which ye fasted at that time, even so, when the fourth 
or fifth moon cometh, ye shall say: Behold, this is the 
season that | fasted and was grieved for the sake of 
the ruined temple and for the sake of the burned city; 
but praise be to God, the temple stands there in all 
honor, and the city most glorious in character. Long 
ago the jug of wine, the wreath and the beautiful skirt; 
let us be merry and praise God instead of the fasting 
and mourning we used to have at this time of the 
year. Behold, this is to turn rejoicing into joy, 
mourning into gladness, and fasts into glad feasts. 

27 But it is written that they should love the truth 
and peace, lest the presumptuous wicked think that 
it is enough for them to rejoice on such days, and yet 
they are knaves. Nay, say ye therefore, be merry, and 
forget your fasting and your affliction, and turn your 
chastenings into joyful feasts; that ye nevertheless 
forget not my commandments, but love truth, that is, 
against God right doctrine, pure God's 
commandments, unfeigned faith, and righteous 
worship, that you do not become superstitious to me, 
or false hypocrites and glorifiers, the same peace 
toward your neighbor, that you do not have hatred, 
envy and disunity, but love and friendship, peace and 
favor, patience and mercy among yourselves. If the 
two pieces go, all is well, then let fasting cease, and 
make merry feasts of it, and be of good cheer. Do you 
see how God reverses the ways of men and 
demands His commandments alone? 

028 But how thinkest thou of our teachers, who in 
this place have drawn this saying of the four fast 
months unto the four soft fasts, or quatember? Does 
it not rhyme well with them? God says that these four 
fasts should be over, and that they should be joyous 
feasts; so they draw out these words, that there 
should be four fasts. 


1904 Erl. 42, 279-282. interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 8, 18-23. 


sad fasting of the year. How finely the Word of God and 
the teachings of men go together! Yes, how finely they 
look at God's words, and how diligently they read them! 
Just as God barked that the four fasts should be nothing 
but feasts of joy, they teach that they should be four 
fasts. It is obvious that they have not considered more in 
this text than the word "fast", then the four moons. After 
that they made the quatember, regardless of how the 
moons or fasts rhymed or not from this text. It is enough 
that they found four moons there, and the word "fasting". 

(29) Just as they do in other matters, that where God 
teaches no, they teach yes; where God teaches faith 
and grace, they do works and merit. They are still angry, 
and do not want to hear it said, how up to now the 
Scriptures have lain under the bench with them, and 
their mad dreams must have ruled everything in their 
place. For here you see, and you must grasp it, that they 
have interpreted this text, which says no to fasting, as a 
yes, and they have straightforwardly and absurdly drawn 
God's word to their jugglery, and yet, with it, as with 
God's word, they have deafened the world and 
confirmed their thing. 


Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet shall many 
nations come, and the inhabitants of many cities, and 
shall go from city to city, saying, Let us go to pray 
before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts, and 
we will go with you. 


(30) This saying and promise | understand, that not 
only the Jews should return to Jerusalem, as it is said 
above [vv. 7, 8], from all countries, but that Jerusalem 
should become so glorious and famous that also many 
Gentiles should find themselves there to worship the 
Lord. All this was fulfilled, as Josephus writes, that many 
kings and princes, along with others, did great honor to 
the temple at Jerusalem. And also Lucas writes [Apost. 
8, 27.], how the queen Candace's chamberlain went 
from Mohrenland to Jerusalem. No doubt there were 
many such things in other cities and countries, as 
follows. 





W. VI, 3484-3487. 1905 


V.22. So many nations and peoples will come in 
multitudes to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, to 
pray before the LORD. 


(31) This is the sum of it, that Jerusalem shall be very 
glorious, and as Haggai [Cap. 2:10] also saith, that this 
latter temple shall be more glorious than the former and 
the first. For of 1) the first temple, which Solomon built, it 
is not read that so many nations and kings came thither, 
and had so much devotion to it, as to this last, which 
drew almost the whole world to itself; as the histories 
prove. So this promise is almost great, that the temple at 
Jerusalem should "become so glorious", far above the 
temple that was built, and yet it was so bad when it was 
to be built. What it means to seek the Lord and to worship 
him has been sufficiently said. 


V. 23 Thus says the LORD of hosts: "At the time 
when ten men of all tongues of the Gentiles shall take 
a Jewish man by the tail,” saying, "We will go with you, 
for we hear that God is with you. 


Some have interpreted this saying as referring to the 
time of Christ, when many Gentiles in all tongues were 
attached to all the apostles and came to Christ. This is a 
good opinion, but in this place it does not seem to me to 
be very true. The prophet is herewith signifying how it 
shall come to pass, that many cities and nations shall go 
to Jerusalem to worship the Lord in the temple, of which 
he hath spoken; namely, that, because the Jews are 
scattered among all the Gentiles, they shall cleave unto 
them many Gentiles, and bring them to their faith. Then 
when they went to the feast at Jerusalem, the same 
Gentiles went with them, because they wanted to serve 
God with the Jews. This is why he says, "At the same 
time," that is, at the time when many Gentiles will go to 
Jerusalem, as he said above [v. 20], such a going will 
happen so that the Gentiles will attach themselves to the 
Jews, so that they will hear from the Jews that God 
dwells at Jerusalem. Such seemeth to me to be the most 
simple and sure understanding, that GOD may declare 
how glorious Jeru-.

salem and the temple, no matter how deeply it lay in 
ashes and shame at that time. Even though 
everything had to be prepared for the future kingdom 
of Christ, as has often been said. 

033 And when he saith, Ten men of divers tongues 
shall cleave unto the corner of one Jewish man, is it 
not said, that so ten shall cleave, and not more, nor 
more than ten? 





Nor that every Jew should bring so much with him, 
but it is spoken in a common language, thus: Here a 
Jew and there a Jew will bring many Gentiles with 
him, from all kinds of Gentiles and countries. As also 
St. Lucas Apost. 2, 5. writes that at the feast of 
Pentecost there were men from all nations under 
heaven in Jerusalem 2c. 


The ninth chapter. 


V. 1. This is the burden of which the Lord has 
spoken concerning the land of Hadrach and 
Damascus, upon which it relies. 


So far we have heard how the prophet comforted 

and strengthened the stupid and frightened Jews to 
build the temple for the preparation of the future 
kingdom of Christ. And even though temporal and 
physical goods are promised in it, such promises are 
not to be disregarded because they are God's words 
and great examples of faith are presented in them. 
Some, however, who pretend to great spirituality, do 
not regard such carnal goods, and do not see how 
great faith lies in such promises, gawking at spiritual 
promises, when they themselves have never 
believed for an hour that God would feed them with 
bread and drink. | say this once for the reason that 
the examples of faith and the divine promises in the 
old stories should not be overflowed, as Origen and 
Jerome are wont to do, as if they were dead, useless 
histories, and something greater should be sought in 
them. If one looks at the things that are promised, 
they are nothing but temporal, physical goods; but if 
one looks at the promises, they are living, eternal 
words of God, which justified and saved those who 
believed in them at the time. And such faith is a great, 
powerful example to strengthen our faith. 
(2) Therefore the prophet shall prophesy henceforth 
how all things shall come to pass after these things, 
and how Christ shall come, upon whom these things 
shall be. 


everything has been done with the temple so far. And 
although there are many glosses made on this place, 
I still think that this is the opinion and summa, that the 
surrounding countries and neighbors of the Jews, as 
Syria and Palestine with their cities Damascus, Tyre, 
Zidon, Antioch, Accaron 2c. are to be devastated and 
thus humbled, so that as they have been hostile and 
against Jerusalem until now, so now they will also 
become friends, and accept Christ in his future. That 
is why he says: "This is the burden of which the Lord 
speaks about Hadrach" 2c. But "burden" means a 
punishment in the prophets, as we have heard in 
Habakkuk [Cap. 1, 1.], and in Jeremiah 1) it is 
especially common [Jer, 23, 34. 36. 38.]. But this 
burden and punishment is, as follows, that they are 
to be destroyed, burned and won. 

3 Hadrach is an unknown word, and nowhere else 
in Scripture except in this place. But since it is certain 
that he means the land of Syria, where Damascus is 
the royal capital, | think the Prophet gives the same 
land a new name, composed of two words, Had and 
Rach. Had means to be joyful, and Nach means 
tender or soft. Just as we Germans say of women, 
"She is so tender and lukewarm that she will not take 
hold of cold water unless she is aired,” so that the 
Prophet's opinion is, "This is the burden over the land 
of Hadrach, 


1) Instead of Jeremiah, Isaiah should be read. Cf. Isa. 13, 1. 14, 
28. 15, 1.17, 1. 19, 1. 21, 1. 22, 1.

Interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 9, 1-4.' W. VI, 3491-3493.

That is, over the tender, faded land, which until now has 
been accustomed to vain joys, good days and honors, 
and also never wanted to get into cold water, suffer no 
evil nor tolerate misfortune; misfortune will also come 
upon you one day, and you will get a foreign master. 

4. he also calls Damascus of the same land rest. 
Because in the Hebrew it reads thus: And over 
Damascon, which is its rest. We have translated this: "on 
it it relies", which is also the correct sense of the text, as 
Isaiah Cap. 7, 2: Syria rests on Ephraim, that is, Syria 
relies on Ephraim 2c. So Laud Syria relied and rested on 
Damascus, as on a strong and mighty city, by which it 
would be safe and protected and could have good days. 


For the Lord looks upon men, and upon all the 
tribes of Israel. 


5 Whether this text is correct, | leave to the Hebrew 
masters to judge, | am not sure myself whether | have 


got it right. The Hebrew text stands thus: quoniam

Israel. Which may give various meanings, which are not 
to be told here. | will stick to the one that the prophet 
wants to say how the surrounding countries are before 
the Lord as well as the tribes of Israel, and that no one 
may hide or escape from him. Therefore, as he has 
punished the tribes of Israel, so he will not leave these 
countries unpunished. 


V, 2. Also about Hamath, which borders with her. 


Hamath is the city that was later called Antioch, where 
the disciples of Christ were first called Christians, Acts 
11:26. 11, 26. The same city borders with the land Syria 
and the city Damascus, yes, it also belongs to the land 
Syria. Now when the burden passes over Damascus, it 
will also pass over Antioch, because they are so close to 
each other. 


About Tyrum and Zidon too, who find almost wise. 


7. tyre and zidon, both by the sea, find also in syria, 
and border with the jewi 





They were also strong, rich, powerful cities at that time, 
subject to no one. And he says: they are wise or prudent, 
not of spiritual but of worldly wisdom, namely, that they 
had a delicious government, were rich and powerful, to 
which no doubt wise, sensible people belong. Thus also 
Ezekiel Cap. 28, 3. that the prince of Tyro was wiser than 
Daniel. For where fools and idiots rule, there are neither 
rich cities nor lands. 


V. 3: For Tyre builds solidly, and gathers silver like 
earth, and gold like dung on the gaff. 


8 Then you see what wisdom he gives to the tyrants, 
namely, that they are wise and prudent to build the city 
firmly against the enemies, and to collect large sums of 
money and goods for future needs, and thus to provide 
for themselves in the best possible way in the temporal 
regime. For this is what is called wise government, when 
land and cities are well kept and provided for; but against 
God no building nor provision helps. Therefore follows: 


V. 4, But behold, the LORD shall destroy her, and 
shall smite her power that she hath upon the sea, and 
she shall be burned with fire. 


(9) This is the burden of which he said above [v. 1] 
that it should pass over these lands and cities. Because 
Tyro, which was the most powerful and strongest of them 
all, will suffer this fate, so will the others. Of course, this 
destruction and devastation was caused by the great 
Alexander. For he brought about such a burden, 
especially in Tyre, where he was a long time in front and 
waged war; and after that these countries were always 
at war and never had peace because of the kings who 
ruled in Syria and Egypt after Alexander, until the 
Romans won the land. Now it is not possible, where 
there is much and long warfare, that the land and the 
cities should perish; so that this tender and lumpy land 
has well been driven out of the thrill, that all such mighty 
cities have lost their dominion, and have at last been 
forced under the Romans, and so humbled, that they 
could well suffer and receive Christ in the future.

V. 5 When Asklon sees it, she will be terrified, and 
Gasa will be very afraid, and Ekron will be grieved 
when she sees it. 


010 Then he brought in the land of the Philistines, 
which had always been against the Jews, and had 
always had their own rulers; but now Alexander and 
his descendants became rulers, and gained such 
mighty cities as Tyre and Zidon, which no man could 
gain before, they were afraid, because they saw it, 
and perceived that their dominion was ended, as it is 
now: 


V. 6 For the king of Gaza shall be finished, and there 
shall be no dwelling in Asklon; in Ashdod shall the 
children of Hur dwell: so shall the glory of the 
Philistines be cut off. 


(11) As | said, until now the land of the Philistines 
has always had its own kings and lords, and has been 
a well inhabited, powerful land; but after that it was 
horribly devastated and ruined by wars (as | said), 
because it was overpowered by Alexander's 
descendants, and since then it has not had its own 
kings or lords, and even today the same cities are 
almost desolate, so that Lucas also calls Acts 8:26 
Gaza desolate. 8, 26, calls Gaza desolate. But when 
he says, "The children of a whore shall dwell in 
Ashdod," in Hebrew it means, "Ashdod shall come 
under the hands of strangers, so that the natives shall 
no longer reign nor dwell there, but shall be 
strangers. Now strangers in a city are not the proper 
children of that city, but are like the children of a 
whore in a Hanse, where they are not born nor do 
they belong. So the splendor, court, dominion and 
power of the Philistines shall come to an end. And all 
these things happened at the time that passed 
between the coming of Christ and the building of the 
temple, as is well known by all who have read the 
histories, and Zechariah has said all these things 
beforehand, and has made them clear. 


V.7 And | will put their blood out of their mouth, and 
their abominations out of their teeth; and they shall 
remain unto our God. 





VI. 3493-3496. 1911 

(12) Though the Philistines have been the most 
stiff-necked enemies above all others, yet, when they 
are so disturbed and humbled that they are no more, 
they become good to me. Then | will accept them, 
and they shall be kept for me when | come, that they 
may become good Christians, and the best friends of 
my people. But when he says that he will put blood 
from their mouths and abominations from their teeth, 
| understand that he wants to make them friends of 
his people. For until now (as has been said) they 
were a fierce people against the Jews, and 
bloodthirsty to destroy them. Therefore he called 
their mouth bloodthirsty, and their teeth full of 
abominations, because they devoured the Jews with 
war and wrath, that is, they shed and choked blood 
continually, and were greedy and fierce to choke and 
shed blood, as the bears and lions. All these things 
shall now cease, they shall no more devour and shed 
blood. | will humble them, and they shall be glad, and 
shall be the friends of my people, and shall keep their 
mouths clean, and their teeth pure, from their blood 
and their flesh. 


And they shall be as princes in Judah, and Ekron as 
the Jebusites. 


(13) That is, | will also choose bishops and 
preachers among them, as well as in Judah. But the 
name of the prince here is Aluph [XXXX], which is the 
name of such a prince 1) who presides over the 
teaching as the teachers, preachers and bishops 
shall do. Uird Ekron shall be like the Jebusites, that 
is, the citizens of Ekron shall be Christians as well as 
the citizens of Jerusalem, whom he here calls 
Jebusites after the old pagan name. For Jerusalem 
of old was called Jebus, as we read in Joshua [Cap. 
15:8]. And may need the old name to obscure the 
prophecy, or to indicate that in Christ's time 
Jerusalem was cheaply called Jebus for the sake of 
her unbelief, and again, Ekron was cheaply called 
Teacher and Christian, that is, rightly Jerusalem, for 
the sake of her faith. All this was said to prepare the 
Philistines before the coming of Christ, so that when 
he came they would accept him.

And his dominion will be from sea to sea, and from 
the waters to the ends of the earth. 

19 This saying is taken from the 72nd Psalm, v. 8, 
so that it may be seen how the same Psalm must not 
be understood by Solomon, as the Jews think, but by 
Christ himself. For in these words the whole earth is 
subjected to Christ. From one sea, that is, from the 
dead sea in Judea, to all the other seas around, and 
from the water, the Jordan, to the end of the world. 
For his kingdom began in Judea, where the dead sea 
is, and the Jordan, and so it has gone forth into all the 
earth. 


v.11. You also let your prisoners out of the pit by 
the blood of your covenant, where there is water in it. 

20 He has now said that this kingdom should not 
be in outward, worldly splendor, but in poverty, and 
yet establish righteousness and salvation for his 
people, and for this purpose make peace among the 
Gentiles, not only to reconcile the Gentiles with the 
Jews, and to make one people out of both, as far as 
the world is, which until now have always been mortal 
enemies, as St. Paul Ephesians 3:8, 9 also says. Paul 
Eph. 3, 8. 9. also says, but also peace between God 
and us, Rom. 5, 1. One might ask: With what will he 
accomplish all this, which no one could accomplish 
with any worldly power? He answers here and says: 
By the blood of your testament or covenant 2c., and 
holds this blood against the blood of the old 
testament, and also cancels the same herewith. As if 
to say, Moses brought his people out of Egypt by the 
blood of his testament, but you, the new king, will 
establish another, new testament, and will abolish 
that by the blood of your testament, so that you will 
not bring the people of Israel out of Egypt, but will 
bring your captives out of another Egypt, that is, "out 
of the pit where there is no water. This is the power 
that thou mayest establish such righteousness, 
salvation, and peace, without sword and armor, even 
by thy suffering, blood, and death. 

21 Thus this text first gives that this king shall die 
and shed his blood. 


to obtain righteousness, salvation and peace for his 
people, that is, forgiveness of sins and eternal life. 
Secondly, that he should also rise again from death 
and live forever, because it follows how he should 
spread such a testament through the gospel and rule 
his own, as we will hear, which no dead man can do. 
So now we have that Christ had to die, and rise again, 
and so go into his glory, as Lucas Cap. 24, 26. 

22) But that some have understood this saying of 
old, that this pit was the outer castle of hell, where the 
old fathers should have been, and that Christ came 
to them when he went down to hell, and brought them 
out, | leave in their simple mind and favor. But it 
cannot be proved from the Scriptures, nor from this 
place, because Zechariah does not take here such a 
small part as the fathers had, but the whole kingdom 
of Christ, as far as the world is, and the whole 
redemption of all saints, and the blood of the whole 
New Testament, with all its power and fruit. And 
speak of all these things gloriously, for the text hangs 
together, and all goes to the whole redemption of all 
saints. 

(23) Therefore he called the pit without water the 
prison of sins in the law, wherein we all lay captive 
under the devil, which is signified by the prison in 
Egypt. For there is no water of life to refresh and 
comfort the soul, but eternal thirst in eternal heat. 
Which prison is also meant by the 68th Psalm, v. 19, 
when it says: "Thou hast gone up on high, and hast 
caught the prison" 2c. And in the Hebrew he puts it 
finely against the Old Testament, because he says: 
"You have also by blood" 2c., that is, Moses indeed 
carried out his people by blood of a testament, but 
you also, you also have a blood, that is a blood of 
your testament, and not of Moses, and you also did 
not want to carry out your people without blood 2c. 
Likewise, he says, "Your captives," not Mosi's 
captives; for Mosi's people were captives in the flesh. 
But "thy captives,” that is, those whom thou carryest 
out by thy blood, are other captives, even as thou also 
hast another blood, another testament, also

you are another man than Moses. | show all this from 
the text, so that everyone may see for himself how 
Zechariah does not prophesy here about the dead, but, 
to my mind, about the whole redemption that Christ has 
purchased through his blood. But if anyone is filled with 
other things, let him always go. 


V. 12. Return therefore to the fortress, which ye lie 
in captivity for hope. 

(24) Because this great redemption has come about 
through my blood, watch and do not despise it. Hitherto 
ye have lain captive under the law in sins, and have 
been in the mire and sand, yea, ye have been every 
man's spoil and prey: he that came hath led you, and 
driven you, and scattered you according to his will, 
because ye were captives, and were not kept from your 
taskmasters. Then came the scribe, and chased you 
from one work to another, and yet helped nothing; there 
was no rest. Here the devil came, and drove you from 
one sin to another, and was no security, but vain fear of 
death. But now you have a strong, secure fortress, 
where you may be safe and at peace, both from the law 
and the sin-doers, namely the blood of my testament; 
there keep yourselves, otherwise there is no rest nor 
peace from the law and sins. 


(25) He calls them Vinctos spel, prisoners of hope, 
that is, those who hoped and waited for redemption, as 
Simeon Luc. 2:25 waited for the redemption of Israel. 
For they had the promise of God in the prophets that 
they would be redeemed through Christ. They waited for 
this hope with great longing until it came, because they 
felt Moses, the scribe of laws, and the sinner, the devil. 

26 Therefore the prisoners of hope are all those who 
despair of their works, and, being humbled by the law, 
are in the knowledge of their sins. These are also the 
ones whom he here calls Christ's prisoners, since he 
says: "Your prisoners. For the hopeful saints, who want 
to be pious and righteous by works of the law, are not 
prisoners of hope, for they do not wait for redemption; 
nor is the blood of this testament of any concern to them; 
indeed, they are completely free and unconstrained. 


Do not catch them, let them be prisoners of hope. The 
same ones who deal with human doctrines and works 
are also holy and free, may not give anything to this 
fortress, because they are already safe, and live in 
peace and quiet. 

(27) But we poor sinners, who are driven by the law, 
so that we feel how it demands, which we neither have 
nor are able to do, and thus are overloaded with sins 
before God, with a stupid, despondent, evil conscience, 
and then realize that we must be of death because of 
sins, and thus lie in this miserable prison, are prisoners 
of hope. For we wait for redemption, not by our works, 
but by the blood of this testament, as St. Paul draws from 
this saying Gal. 5:5, saying, "But we wait in the spirit of 
hope, that we may be justified by faith." So this text alone 
applies to those who through law and sin feel their 
imprisonment in a miserable conscience, and hope for 
grace through Christ's blood, through which they are 
redeemed and justified, have peace, and dwell in a firm, 
secure castle. 


For also 1) | declare unto you this day, that | will 
recompense thee for double things. 


28) Read the epistle to the Hebrews in the third [v. 7] 
and fourth chapters [v. 7, cap. 13, 8], and you will find 
what the Holy Spirit wants to be understood by the word 
"today", namely, that the Jews should perceive such 
preaching and grace at the present time, when Christ 
would come, who is the right "healed", and not gape at 


another, future time. So now this is the opinion: Hodie 


annuncians reddam tibi duplicia, | will reimburse you 
for your misery twofold good, so that, which | preach 
healed, that is, by the preaching, which is to go at this 
time, when | redeem my prisoners by my blood, | will give 
you instead of all your suffering (as there is, the law and 
sin) twofold comfort and good, namely twofold 
redemption, 


1) The word "also", which is necessary according to § 2tz, is 
missing in the original and in all German editions. Walch has added 
it correctly. In Latin: quoquo. 

3) In the original, in the Wittenberg (German and Latin) and in the 
Erlangen: "im andern und dritten Cap.". The Jenaer and after it Walch 
have improved this. 


1918 Erl. 42, ss<--2g8. Interpretations on the prophets. W. vi, 3504-3sos. 


1919 





Both from the law and from sin; that therefore the law 
shall not oppress nor afflict thee and thy conscience, 
neither shall sin afflict nor condemn thee with death; 
for by my blood both these things shall be done away, 
that the law may be fulfilled, that thou mayest be 
justified, and sin be done away, that thou mayest live 
before death. These then are two blessed liberties, 
wherein is eternal life. Of these two freedoms or 
redemptions also says Isaiah Cap. 40:2: "Jerusalem 
hath received double for all her iniquity: for her sin is 
forgiven her, and her knighthood (that is, her service 
under the law) is ended." 

(29) The word "anch" here, as above [v. 7], is to 
be noted. For it reads as if he wanted to say, "You 
have many teachers and preachers who preach a lot 
and burden you with sins; you are used to them and 
know nothing else. But | will also preach, and not let 
the preachers speak alone. But my preaching is not 
at all like their preaching. For they afflict and humiliate 
thee with two evils. Through the law they make your 
conscience heavy with sin, and with sin they make 
your heart afraid and despondent through death, 
which is the wages of sins, Rom. 6:23. But my 
preaching shall make you free and free from both, 
only that you pay attention to it "today", at this time. 

(30) Now mark, that this twofold good be 
distributed by word and preaching, that it be received 


and kept by faith. For he saith, annuncians reddam 


duplicia, by preaching will | give thee double. This is 
also the very worst, and hinders the Jews to this day. 
They would like to feel and grasp it as a physical 
good, so that they would be free and free in the flesh, 
but they pay no attention to spiritual salvation; but it 
must be preached, heard and believed. It is a spiritual 
kingdom, and its goods and riches are spiritual. 


V.13. For | have made Judah my bow, and | have 
armed Ephraim; and | will raise up thy children, O Zion, 
over thy children, O Greece; and | will set thee as a 
sword of giants. 


The words are almost worldly, as if it were a 
physical dispute; but everything is said, according to 
the foregoing, about the ministry of preaching, which 
should first begin at Jerusalem among the Jews, as 
now said, and then continue on, even among the 
Gentiles, as he says here. The stretched bow from 
Judah are the dear apostles from the tribe of Judah, 
as also the 68th Psalm, v. 28. says of 1) princes of 
Judah in Christendom. Ephraim are the apostles and 
disciples from the families of Israel, whom he fills 
(hear) with arrows, and equips well. For in Christ the 
two kingdoms of Judah and Ephraim had to come 
together again into one kingdom, as we have heard 
above [Cap. 9, § 17]. 

(32) So then, to draw bows and to arm with arrows 
is nothing else than to send out skilled preachers who 
have been taught by God. And the same are the 
children of Zion, whom He raised up over the children 
of Greece, that is, the apostles and disciples sent with 
the gospel into Greece from Zion, when they began 
and became spiritual children of Zion through the 
Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost [Acts 2:4]. And 
their sword should be like the sword of a sneezer, that 
is, the word of God should be powerful and active, so 
that it penetrates mightily, as we also read that the 
word of St. Paul and his companions was powerful in 
Asia [Acts 19:20]. 


V.14, And the LORD will appear over them, and his 
arrows will execute like lightning. 


033 That is, he himself shall be with them, and it 
shall be seen in the Holy Ghost, and in the miraculous 
signs which they shall do, that the Lord is upon them, 
and with them. For the apostles' words are not their 
own words, but are the arrows of the Lord; the 
apostles are his bow and his weapons; therefore they 
go forth like lightning, and are powerful and fruitful 
words, which terrify the hopeful and comfort the 
humble. 


1) In the German editions wrong: "vom". In Latin correctly: Us 
prinaipikus. Walch has erroneously "the 78th Psalm, v. 9." This has 
taken the Erlanger as the correctur for Ps. 67 (according to the 
Vulgate count).

And the Lord GOD shall blow with a trumpet, and 
shall go forth with a thunderstorm at noonday. 


(34) There shall be another blowing of horns and 
sounding of trumpets, which was under the law ordained 
by Moses. The Lord himself will blow the trumpets, that 
is, he will sound the same gospel through the apostles, 
proclaiming that all the world is sinful and guilty before 
God. Therefore it will be like a great weather, thunder 
and lightning, as they are wont to be at noon. For it 
proclaims the wrath of God against all ungodliness and 
injustice of men, Rom. 1, 18, so that the arrogant will be 
terrified and humble themselves to grace. But the world 
will confidently oppose and resist, persecuting the word 
and the apostles. But it will not help. For 


v.15. The LORD of hosts will protect them, that 
they may devour and subdue with sling stones, and 
drink and rumble as of wine, and be filled as the basin, 
and as the corners of the altar. 


(85) The prophet diligently uses the splendid and 
flowery speech of strife, tempest, slaughter, 2c., to mean 
that [it] is not an idle or incompetent thing about the 
gospel, but accomplishes great things, because it 
overthrows and strikes down all that is great, learned, 
holy, wise, strong, and proud, and humbles everyone 
under Christ, as Paul says 2 Cor. 10:4: "Our weapons 
are not carnal, but mighty through God." Because the 
world cannot stand such humility and overthrow, it fights 
against it, persecutes and rages against the apostles, as 
against poor, abandoned, powerless people on earth. 
But hear here what a protector they have against them: 
"The LORD of hosts will protect them." Not that they 
should suffer nothing in the body, for they must be 
persecuted and killed, but that their ministry, word and 
preaching may not be hindered nor dampened, but it 
penetrates and continues the more it is hindered. For 
God's word is unbound, though Panlus is bound [2 Tim. 
2:9]. 

But how is it that they eat and drink? 





bring them under themselves? How can that become 
subject which is eaten? Therefore it is a spiritual 
devouring, that the apostles will bring the Gentiles to 
themselves by their mouth with the word, and will 
integrate them into their assembly, and thus make them 
subject to the obedience of faith to Christ; and they will 
do this with sling stones, just as David brought Goliath 
under himself with the bodily sling stone [1 Saul. 17, 49. 
50.]. But these sling stones will be spiritual, the word of 
God, so that they will throw them with such certainty and 
hit the consciences in such a way that they will not be 
able to resist or hide, but will have to give themselves up 
captive and say: It is the truth. 

(37) They shall also roar, or rave, as if they were full 
of wine. This is the same thing, that they shall make as 
many Gentiles Christians by the word, and _ shall 
penetrate boldly as the drunken. For they are full of the 
Holy Spirit, Apost. 2:4, which makes them bold to go 
confidently among the Gentiles, and to spare no journey, 
but to make merry among them with the word, until they 
drink the same Gentiles into themselves, and make 
them Christian members. 

(38) But | would rather understand and distinguish 
this eating and drinking, that the apostles should not only 
be protected and sheltered, so that their ministry 
continues unhindered, but should also have enough to 
eat and drink. Eating, so that they may abstain and 
become strong to bring the Gentiles under Christ. Drink, 
so that they may become joyful and bold, confidently 
rumbling with the word among the Gentiles and fearing 
no danger. But such eating and drinking is spiritual, that 
they themselves may first be filled and full of the word 
and the Spirit, and increase daily more and more, that 
they may not grow weary in their ministry or in 
tribulations, even as the body must daily have its food, 
that it may endure the daily labor. 

39 But what is this, "They shall be full as the laver, 
and as the corners of the altar"? With this he indicates 
the old priesthood and points to the new priesthood. As 
if to say, "Then the priesthood will be right and full; so 
when the apostles rumble among the Gentiles, there will 
be a slaughter and sacrifice when they pass through the 
altar. 


1922 Erl. 42, 300-308. Interpretations on the Prophets 


The word of God punish and kill the old man with all 
his works, and thus sacrifice in honor of God, just as 
the ancient priests sacrificed the unreasonable 
animals 2c. Such sacrifices are practiced by St. Paul 
Rom. 12, 1. when he says: "Offer your bodies as a 
living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God" 2c. 

40. but he calls "the basin" and "corners of the 
altar". For as Moses wrote in the third book [Cap. 3, 
2. 8. 13. 4, 5.ff. 2 Mos. 24, 6.], the basin was needed 
to take the blood of the sacrificed animals three times 
and to carry it into it, and to sprinkle it with the finger 
against the ark seven times, and to coat the horns of 
the altar with it, and to pour the rest at the bottom of 
the altar. By all these things the prophet prophesies 
that the Gentiles, according to the old man, shall be 
slain by the gospel for a sacrifice acceptable to God, 
and that their blood also shall be holy and glorious in 
his sight. 


v.16. And the LORD their God will help them at that 
time, as He would a flock of His people. 

(41) That is, they which were hitherto scattered 
abroad, and divided into divers manners of doctrine, 
he will therefore by the gospel bring together into one 
faith, as one house and one host. For the Jews also 
were scattered abroad in their way, and had divers 
ways of becoming godly among themselves, as 
Pharisees, Sadducees, scribes. But the pagans 
much more, who were divided into innumerable 
groups of idolatry in the whole world. But since they 
were punished by the gospel, and such unbelief was 
killed, along with all the wisdom and prudence of the 
old Adam, they were all brought together in one faith 
and doctrine. 


For consecrated stones will be raised in his land. 
These stones are also the apostles and preachers of 
the gospel, and are not only precious stones, but also 
consecrated stones. For neser [XXX] in Hebrew 
means consecration or sanctification, by which a 
person or other thing is set apart for the service of 
God, as the Nazarites, Num. 6:2 ff. Just so speaks 


. W. VI, 3509-3512. 1923 
St. Paul Rom. 1, 1. that he was set apart (that is, a 
Nazarene) to preach the gospel; as Apost. 13, 2. also 
speaks of him and Barnaba: "Set apart for me 
Barnabam and Saulum" 2c. 

43. But that they are set up is not said of bad 
indignation, 1) but as one sets up a banner or a sign, 
and the whole army looks at it, and judges itself by it, 
as the Hebrew word Nossoth gives it, that the opinion 
is: That the Christians everywhere should be brought 
together in one faith through the gospel, as has been 
said, is to be done in such a way that they will not 
gather together in physical places, as has happened 
up to now in Jerusalem, but they will cling to the 
apostles and adhere to their teaching. For these also 
shall be set up among the Gentiles, as holy stones 
and pillars or places of worship in Christendom, 
whither all Christians shall look, and be guided by 
their doctrine; that there may be unity of doctrine and 
faith, and that every man may not set up his own 
doctrine and mastery, that the host may be divided, 
and that there may be divisions in the midst of the 
glory. 


V. 17 For what good do they have with them? And 
what fine thing have they with them? Grain that begets 
young men, and must that begets virgins. 


44. Christ will not redeem or gather his own with 
armor and weapons, but by food and drink he will 
accomplish everything. This is a strange king to me, 
who does nothing but serve bread and wine, and 
thereby not only gathers his own, but also begets a 
strong people, both male and female. The sum of this 
text is this: In the people and kingdom of Israel it is 
so, that they beget children in the flesh by the natural 
way, of man and woman; but in this kingdom it is 
strange; there is the very finest and sweetest 
childbearing and multiplying of the people. For there 
are no children conceived in the cradle. What then? 
Vain fine, strong young men, and full, fair young- 





1) This is how all German editions read. The Latin translator has 
given it by elevatio.

1925 





So that everything that is born and raised to this king, 
that is, young men and virgins, great boys and great 
maidens, who are fit to marry, may be born quickly. For 
where a Christian is made, he can so soon teach and 
do, and make other Christians more proficient. Just as if 
a mother gave birth to a boy who could immediately take 
a wife and produce children, that would be a strange 
child. So are all Christians: they are complete young 
men, who by the word can also beget others, and 
complete virgins, who can bear and give birth to other 
Christians. 

45. and such witnessing and multiplying is done 
through grain and must, that is, through the gospel, as 
Paul 1 Cor. 4, 1) 15. confesses to such a young man and 
father, saying: "| have begotten you through the gospel", 
again Gal. 4, 19. he makes himself such a virgin and 
mother, saying: "Dear children, whom | bear otherwise, 
until Christ 


1) In the original: "1 Cor. 3." Walch has by a misprint 1 Cor. 1, 15. 
This has taken the Erlanger as a correctur of the original. 


to gain a form in you." So Christ's people are such a 
people, increased by the gospel, and so increased that 
they can quickly be fathers and mothers, and in turn 
beget others who can also be fathers and mothers. 

46 The prophet says that young men and virgins are 
multiplied by grain and must. Isaiah 66:7, 8 speaks of 
such childbearing: "Before one gives birth, and before 
the time of birth comes, she has given birth to a man. 
Who has ever heard this? Who hath ever seen such a 
thing, that a land should bring forth in a day, or a nation 
be born at once, as Zion brought forth her children?" 2c. 
As if to say, A woman can bear a child, but not a man. 
But Zion gives birth to men. Item, a woman must have 
time before she gives birth, at least she must be fourteen 
years old. But Zion gives birth quickly when she is one 
day old. And where a nation is to be begotten on earth, 
many years belong to it. But Zion gives birth to a nation 
at once, in one day. 


The tenth chapter. 


V. 1. 2. Ask therefore of the LORD the rain of the 
sparrows, and the LORD shall make the floods, and 
give them rain enough for all the plants of the field. 2. 


1 This is said of the spiritual rain, that is, of the 
teaching of the gospel, on the opinion: Since the gospel 
is promised to come in the previous chapter, send 
yourselves also to it, and do not wait for it alone, but also 
ask for it. For here is the time to ask for the right rain, 
lest you be hindered with the doctrines of men and the 
works of the law, and be found unready for this rain. 
Com- 


2) In the Erlanger: "ihn"; in the Wittenberger: "jnen"; this seems to 
be the translation given by Luther instead of "euch" in our Bible and 
the other editions. 





But it must be accepted and not despised, but desired 
and received with diligent attention. If you do this, you will 
have rain enough for all the growth of all the good fruits 
of the Spirit. 

2 According to this text almost Christ himself speaks 
Matth. 9, 36-38: "But when he saw the people, he was 
grieved, because they were faint and scattered, like a 
flock without a shepherd, and said to his disciples, 'The 
harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Ask the Lord 
of the harvest to send forth laborers into his harvest." 
These laborers are the preachers, whom here the 
prophet calls clouds, in Hebrew chosisim [XXXXX], 
which comes from chasa [XXX], that is, to look or see, 
because the clouds look down, and stand and be seen 
to rain. So also the apostles 


1926 Erl. 42, 304-307. interpretations on the prophets 


. W. VI, 3515-3518. 1927 





were ready and able to give the right rain. And the 
rain is called the rain, which cometh when the corn is 
sprung up, and when the land is parched with heat, 
and when the consciences are heated and thirsty by 
the law, the gospel cometh. 


v. 2 For the idols teach vain troubles, and the 
diviners see vain lies, and teach vain dreams, and their 
comfort is nothing. 


3 Here we see that he said about the spiritual rain 
above [v. 1], because here he gives the cause of such 
admonition and sets the false teaching against the 
rain that comes from the Lord. As if he should say: 
Therefore | admonish you to ask for rain from the 
Lord, so that you do not ask or wait for it from men. 
For where the Lord does not rain and teach, it 
happens, as the text says here, that they teach vain 
troubles, lies and dreams, and give vain false 
comforts, yes, they hinder that one neither desires nor 
waits for the rain of the spar. Therefore he warns to 
beware of them, and exhorts to the rain of sparring. 

004 And he setteth three kinds of teachers, and 
three kinds of doctrines. The first he calls Theraphim 
[XXXX], idols. By this he means the teachers of the 
law who worship with works. For Theraphim in 
Hebrew means idols or worship, especially that which 
is in outward show, as now is the worship of our 
ministers, as is evident from Hosea Cap. 3, 4. and 
Judges. 17, 5. So now he will say. Theraphim, that is 
the teachers of the law, who teach the people that 
they should become godly with many sacrifices and 
such outward services, have nothing more to do with 
hindering this spreading of the gospel than to teach 
trouble,” that is, to demand many works, which do not 
result in a good conscience; And so they remain vain 
troubles, both outwardly in many and various deeds, 
and inwardly in an uncertain conscience, because 
they teach neither faith nor the right understanding of 
the law, as we see in the Gospel [Matth. 15:5] that the 
Pharisees taught much about sacrifice and nothing 
about faith. 

5. the others who prophesy are the false prophets 
who prophesy with false promises. 


and temptations seduce the people. Such were the 
Jewish people who cried, "Peace, peace, when there 
was no peace," as Jeremiah laments [Cap. 6, 14.]; 
that is, for the sake of their good works, which they 
invented and taught, they promised everything good 
from God, just as the Pharisees taught, saying: it 
would be better to give for sacrifice than to feed the 
parents [Matth. 15, 5], just as in our time the clergy 
have sold their masses and services as the best 
works, promising people God's grace and eternal life. 
This is called vain lies and dreams, as they are in 
truth. For they invent all this themselves according to 
their own conceit, and have no word of God on it. 
These are the teachings of men, vain lies and 
dreams. 

The third are the comforters. These are the two of 
them, or all those who protect and defend such false 
teachings and dreams against the true teachers who 
punish the same dreams. For these same comforters 
exhort and keep up the poor people, that they should 
remain in their doctrine, and as they now say, in the 
old faith, always pardon and comfort the poor people 
with good words, and praise their doings to the 
highest, as if it were right and good 2c. But all such 
comforting is nothing. Behold, such teachers and 
idols Christ found when he came, and finds them 
evermore when he comes. But what follows? 


Therefore they are led away like a flock, and are 
miserable because there is no shepherd. 

(7) This is what the poor people get from such 
teachers, that they are driven away and scattered, 
like a herd, into various superstitions and groups. In 
addition, they perish and languish, like the 
abandoned sheep without a shepherd, for whom no 
one waits with the divine, pure word. So also Isaiah 
Cap. 53, 6. says: "We were all scattered like sheep, 
every one to his own way" 2c. In the same way, 
Christ, Matth. 9, 36. ff., also says this, as we have 
heard above [§ 2]. God then rightly perverts this, that 
they not only divide the flock into their groups, but 
also prevent them from desiring the rain of the spar; 
therefore it follows:

W. VI, 3518-3520. 1929 





V. 3. My wrath is kindled against the shepherds, and 
| will punish the goats. 

8 He calls them shepherds, because they have 
the office of shepherds, and yet they are idol 
teachers and dreamers in deed. These were the 
Pharisees, and are all false teachers. The same are 
the goats, who violently push and rule among the 
sheep, which Christ also calls goats, which he will 
put on the left at the last day, Matth. 25, 33. He has 
afflicted such goats, because he has put them out of 
office and disturbed them. 


For the LORD of hosts shall visit his host, even the 
house of Judah, and shall prepare them as a well-bred 
horse for war. 

(9) That is, he shall deliver them from the goats, 
and be himself a shepherd, and shall visit them with 
grace. For in the Hebrew it is written that he will visit 
against the goats, and yet visit for his flock. So that 
two kinds of visitation are proclaimed here: one out 
of anger and wrath, against the goats; the other out 
of grace and mercy, for the flock. Item, not only will 
he graciously visit his army, his people, but he will 
also make well-equipped horses out of them, on 
which he will ride and fight, also to bring others under 
him, namely the Gentiles. Which he has done 
through the apostles and disciples chosen from 
among the Jewish people. But lest it be thought that 
it should be a bodily strife, it follows: 


V. 4. Spikes, Spears, bows, and all the stars are to 
be taken away from them. 

(10) That is, it shall not be in the flesh; there shall 
be no captain of the host, no arrow, no spear, no 
bow, neither shall there be a captain of the field to 
drive them to battle. For there shall be no need of 
any of these things, but they shall be spiritual. Some, 
however, understand this text to mean that from 
among the people of Judah there will be spearheads, 
bows, spearmen and captains who will wage such 
spiritual warfare under the Duke of Christ. And it 
does not rhyme badly with what follows before and 
after. It is a good opinion; but | hold it with the first 
interpretation, will probably find enough who have 
desire to hold against me with the other. 





V.5 And shall be as the giants that tread the mire in 
the street of strife. 

(11) And they shall be such warriors (saith he), 
that they shall be all great heroes and giants, not vile 
warriors, which only increase the multitude, and fetch 
blows; but they shall conquer and prevail, and be vain 
men of valor. For they shall be so mighty by word, 
that they shall not only give way to none, nor flee, but 
shall tread down all their enemies in battle, as one 
treadeth down dung in the street, that they shall lie 
there with all their shame, as follows: 


And shall fight: for the LORD is with them, that the 
horsemen may be put to shame. 

(12) Not by their power, but Christ is with them; 
therefore they also fight so that all the horsemen, and 
all that oppose them, are put to shame, and lie as 
dung in the street. Look at the histories. Are not now 
the Jews, philosophers, heretics, and all things that 
go against the gospel, trodden down like dung in the 
street? What are the Arians? Dung, trampled in the 
street. What are the Manichaeans, Pelagians, and so 
on? Koth in the alley. What are Muenzer and Pabst 
now? Koth in the alley. What do our Sacramenters 
want to become? Koth in the alley. Just as the 83rd 
Psalm, v. 11, also says: "They have become like dirt 
in the country"; and Ps. 18, 43: "I will make them as 
dung in the street." Yes, you say, but the 
Sacramentans do not mean it, but want to have the 
victory. To be sure, they do not mean it. The Jews, 
Arians, Minzer, Pabst did not mean it either; 
nevertheless it happened. That is why he speaks 
here: "They will dispute.” It is a matter of quarreling, 
and it always seems as if they had won; but the Lord 
is here with us, that the horsemen, who think they 
have won, will be put to shame, just when they think 
we have been put to shame, and they have won. This 
is how it has always been, and how it will always be. 


V. 6. And | will strengthen the house of Judah, and 
save the house of Joseph. 

013 That is, in such strife | will be with them, that 
they may be the strongest, 


1930 Eri. 4s, 3vs-311. interpretations on the prophets. 


W. VI, 3520-3523. 1931 





And | will not only save the tribe of Judah, but | will 
also save Halls Joseph, the kingdom of Israel, that is, 
as it is written in the Hebrew, "They also shall prevail 
and prevail, as well as Judah. For as it is said above 
[Cap. 9, § 17], Judah and Israel shall both come 
together again under Christ, and have one grace and 
one spirit. 


And wants to reinstate them, or bring them back. 


14. not into the old kingdom, but into the spiritual, 
of which he speaks here, as follows: 


For | have mercy on her. 


The old kingdom was based on _ Israel's 
obedience. For it was promised to them so far off, 
that if they were righteous they should possess the 
land. Therefore it stood as on fur sleeves, and must 
perish. But this kingdom stands on God's mercy, 
without our piety or merit; therefore it is established 
forever, as he says here, that he will restore them, 
not that they deserve it, but that he will have mercy 
on them; yes, under his mercy, not on their 
righteousness, they shall stand. 


And shall be as they were, since | had not cast them 
off. 


16. such mercy, without its righteousness, makes 
everything bad and right, that they become as if he 
had never been angry with them, but as if they had 
been most obedient, and the promises were all new 
and fresh; all that they had done before is forgotten, 
and there is vain forgiveness of sins. 


For I, the LORD, their God, will hear them. 


017 That is, it shall be in mercy, because it is a 
kingdom of mercy. Before, when they called upon me 
in their kingdom of the flesh, | did not hear them, but 
made them perish with their righteousness, so that 
they were disturbed. But now | am near, and hear 
them when they call, because of my mercy. But such 
hearing shows that they call out much, and that 





pray. Much praying and calling indicates that they 
have much distress and affliction; therefore this must 
be a kingdom of the cross, since there is a God of 
hearing, as the 50th Psalm, v. 15, says: "Call upon 
me in the time of trouble, and | will help thee" 2c. For 
the devil does not celebrate against such a kingdom. 


V.7 And Ephraim shall be as a giant, and her heart 
shall be glad as of wine: and her children shall see it, 
and rejoice, and her heart shall be glad in the LORD. 

(18) Having come to the house of Joseph to speak 
of it apart from the house of Judah, he performs the 
same speech from the house of Joseph to the end of 
the chapter, proclaiming that the kingdom of Israel 
(which was in the house of Joseph and in the tribe of 
Ephraim) should also come under Christ together 
with the house of Judah. Therefore, what he 
prophesies about Judah, he also prophesies about 
the house of Joseph, as fellow members of the same 
kingdom of Christ. First of all, that they also should 
be giants, that is, victorious men and heroes, not 
rabble or lost people, and should be joyful in spirit, 
like those who are joyful from wine. In the same way, 
let their children also rejoice when they see such 
victory of the giants, their fathers, that such rejoicing 
is not of temporal favor or honor, but of the Lord, who 
makes such victory and victors, not by their power, 
but by his mercy and granting. Summa, you hear 
here of giants, strife and victory, that it does not want 
to suffer from the kingdom of the flesh in temporal 
peace and peace, but shall always be of strife and 
not of peace, and yet only of victory. 


V. 8 | will blow to them and gather them, for | will 
redeem them, and they shall multiply as they have 
multiplied before. 

19 This is spoken in Hebrew: "I will blow to them", 
that is, | will stir them with my spirit, as Isaiah Cap. 7, 
18. also uses it, when he speaks: "I will blow to the 
fly" 2c. For spirit and wind are pronounced in the 
Hebrew language with One Word, Ruah [XXX]. And 
here we see that he speaks of the Ephraim who is 
scattered, because he wants to gather him by his 
blowing, 


1932 Erl. 42, 311-314. 


Interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 10, 8-10. W. VI, 3823-3826. 


1933 





To the same faith with Judah, that they may multiply as 
before, that is, they may become many, but now 
spiritually, as follows: 


Vv. 9 For | will sow them among the nations, and 
they shall remember me in far countries. 


020 Thus shall the increase be, that they may be 
scattered among the nations, as seed that increaseth in 
the field. Therefore this must be a spiritual multiplication, 
because they are not to return home to the nations, but 
are to be sown there among the nations and thus 
multiply. All this happens so that they are sent by God 
as preachers among the Gentiles, and thus bring many 
people to themselves and through them to Christ. For 
they are to remember me in distant lands, that is, to 
preach and teach about me, so that they may multiply 
and convert many to me. It was not proper for the Jews 
to remember the Lord outside Jerusalem or to worship, 
as the 137th Psalm, v. 4, says: "How shall we sing of the 
Lord in a foreign land? Because he says here, "They 
shall remember the Lord sown and planted in foreign 
lands," it is clear enough that he is speaking of spiritual 
things, and that the spiritual Jerusalem should be as 
wide as the world. Otherwise he should sow and plant 
them in Jerusalem, and there let them multiply and 
remember the Lord, where he meant a _ physical 
kingdom. 


And shall live with their children and come again. 

(21) Of course, according to the previous text, they 
must be spiritual children, whom they beget by 
multiplying, which is done by sowing among the nations 
(as said above), so that both the seed that is sown 
among the nations and also the fruit that has grown and 
increased from this seed, as the converted Gentiles, 
should live, that is, be of good courage and have 
enough. For "life" in Scripture means to need and enjoy 
life as those who live without misfortune and driving. But 
he means that because the apostle and preacher's life 
is a controversy, as stated above, even in the midst of 
death and all dangers, and when there seems to be no 
life, they should still live, as Paul says in 2 Corinthians 
6:9: "We are like those who die. 





And behold, we live" nevertheless. So also the coming 
again is, that Ephraim, who was scattered in all the world, 
should now come back rightly, where he remains forever, 
namely to Christendom. 


V. 10 For | will bring them again out of the land of 
Egypt, and will gather them out of Assyria, and will 
bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and 
there shall be no lack of one. 


(22) All this must be understood spiritually according 
to the foregoing, otherwise the foregoing cannot stand. 
For it does not rhyme that he should gather them by his 
blowing, that he should sow them among the nations, 
and yet bring them bodily into the land of Judah, though 
it please the Jews so to do. Neither should he bring them 
into Gilead and Lebanon, but into Samaria, and into the 
midst of the land, where they were before. Therefore this 
is the opinion: then the right bringing again will happen 
once, when Christ will bring the children of Israel out of 
Egypt and Assyria to faith through the gospel, that is, ius 
right Gilead and Lebanon. For how should the ten tribes 
of Israel alone come into Gilead and Lebanon, since 
before there were scarcely two half tribes within, as 
Manasseh and Gad? Thus the former, old kingdom of 
Israel would have been more glorious than this, because 
at that time every tribe sat in its inheritance, and here all 
ten should dwell in two half tribes inheritance. How does 
it rhyme that Ephraim should dwell in the inheritance of 
the tribe of Gad, and Manasseh on the other side 
Jordan? which is all against Moses' and Joshua's order, 
that the tribes of Israel should not be mixed together. If 
this is against Moses, then Moses is also against 
Zechariah, so one must give way to the other. But it is 
good for Moses to depart, and let Zechariah speak of 
spiritual Gilead and Lebanon. 

(23) Now Gilead [XXXX] is called a heap of 
testimonies, and Lebanon [XXX] is called clean or white; 
which is the holy scripture or Christianity, in which the 
testimonies are frequent, by which Christ is preached, 
and is in addition clean and white, of pure innocency and 
holiness. To such a multitude of testimonies and 
whiteness comes Ephraim, that is, to the word of God 
and to faith, by which the hearts become pure, white, and 
devout, Apost. 15, 9. 


1934 Erl. 4S, 314-316. interpretations on the prophets. 


W. VI, 3526-3829. 1935 





(24) "That there should not be a lack of one. In 


Hebrew it says: Et non invenietur eis, which some 
understand to mean: so many shall come that they 
will not find room enough for themselves to dwell. 
This would be true if the ten tribes of Israel alone 
were to come to Gilead in the flesh; but in Scripture 
and Christianity enough room would be found, or 
further made. Let each one do as he pleases. 


V. 11. And tribulation shall come upon the sea, and 
he shall beat the waves in the sea. 


(25) Some make this text from the Hebrew, He 
shall pass through the narrow sea, which is very 
pleasing to me. But there may be both, and the 
Opinion is the same, namely, that he speaks of the 
spiritual passage, which happened through the Red 
Sea, when he led the people out of Egypt; as if he 
wanted to say: When God will redeem the tribes of 
Israel, in the new way, and bring them into the right 
Gilead and Lebanon, as is said, then also a right 
passage through the sea will begin, much greater 
than that was through the Red Sea. For this sea will 
be the whole world through which he will lead his 
people. It will resist and oppose them, and will not let 
them pass through, so that it will be a narrow sea for 
God's people, just as the Red Sea resisted and was 
narrow in the place where the children of Israel 
passed through. There shall be tribulation, not only 
upon the people of God, but also upon the sea. For 
their defense and barring will not help them; they will 
have to let the people pass through. For He will smite 
the waves of the sea, that is, He will punish with the 
gospel all that is great and mighty in the world, just 
as Moses smote the Red Sea with his rod [Ex. 14:16]. 


That all deep grounds will dry up in the water. 


26. just as the red sea disappeared after it struck 
Moses, so when the world is struck by the gospel, it 
passes away, becomes humble, gives way, and 
locks up. 


no longer against the apostles and preachers. That 
is, [that] all deep grounds in the water become dry 
through the Spirit of Christ, just as the Red Sea 
became dry through the east wind. Thus the spirit 
plays here with interpretation of the old histories of 
the future nature and change of the gospel. 


Then the splendor of Assyria shall be abolished, 
and the scepter of Egypt shall cease. 

(27) Then he himself tells what kind of sea he 
means, that is, the world with its power and splendor. 
And he mentions the two kingdoms in particular, 
Assyria and Egypt, because these two have done the 
most harm to the tribes of Israel. But because he 
himself says that all the deep waters 2c., he 
undoubtedly also means the power and might of all 
the world. For they are all humbled by the gospel, 
and have had to cease, but the gospel remains. So 
we see here publicly that the prophet does not speak 
of the physical redemption of the Jewish people. For 
such a course and battle in the sea, which dried up 
Assyria and Egypt and all the grounds in waters, 
cannot lead to Gilead, but it must be a spiritual 
Gilead, which is in all the world, where the sea is 
smitten, that is, the kingdoms are humbled. 


V. 12 For | will strengthen them in the Lord, and they 
shall walk in his name, saith the Lord. 

28 That is, they shall prevail and prevail against all 
the waves of the sea, not by weapons or by the 
power of man, but by the power of God, in spirit and 
in faith. And so they walk not in their name, but in the 
name of JESUS CHRIST, for they live and build not 
on their works or righteousness, neither shall any 
man be saved but on his name. For it is not here 
Paul, Apollo, Cephas, but in Christ's grace and 
righteousness they walk, Gal. 2:16: "We are justified 
by faith in JEsum Christ, and not by the works of the 
law."

W. VI, 3828-3832. 1937 





The eleventh chapter. 


V. 1. Open your door, Lebanon, so that the fire may 
consume your cedars. 


(1) Hitherto he had proclaimed the kingdom of Christ, 
and the power and fruit of the gospel, that is, faith among 
the Gentiles; but here he proclaims the destruction of the 
temple of (1) Jerusalem and of the Jewish people. 
Because they wanted to keep the old kingdom and not 
accept the new one, they were destroyed and lost both. 
He calls here the newly built temple "Lebanon", because 
it was built of the cedars Libani, as the Grammatici teach 


that a piece is also called with the name of the whole per 


synecdochen, as when | say: The Wittenbergers drink 
the Faulbach and Frischbach, that is, Wittenberg beer: 
The Thuringian forest gives much warm rooms, that is, 
wood from the Thuringian forest 2c. The Rhine flows 
through the whole of Germany, that is, the Rhenish wine 
2c. The prophet needs to speak this way a lot in this 
place, no doubt not only to obscure the prophecies, but 
also to spare the Jews who were building the temple at 
that time, so that they would not be deterred when they 
heard that the temple was to be destroyed. 

2) So this is the opinion: "Open your door, Lebanon", that 
is, O holy temple of Jerusalem, you will be open to the 
Romans, so that no one can defend them, nor protect 
you, but will go in freely, as if you were standing open by 
yourself, deserted, without all protectors, and burn your 
2) building of cedars, because of the people, that they 
would not recognize the time of their visitation, Luc. 19, 
44, which is said in the next chapter. 


V. 2. Hay, ye firs, for the cedars are fallen, and the 
glorious building is destroyed. 
3. it is called the firs howl, that is, the firs and cedars 
become the cause of the Jews . 

1) This is how all editions have understood the words: "of the 
temple Jerusalem". But would like (after tz 4) very well so to be read: 


of the temple, Jerusalem and 2c. 
2) Erlanger: "den" instead of: dein. 


The temple will be disturbed, both fir trees and cedars 
and all the magnificent buildings will fall, be disturbed 
and burned, as Daniel Cap. 9:26 proclaims. 


Hay, you oaks of Bashan, for the solid forest is 
hewn down. 


4 Here, | think, he means the whole city of Jerusalem, 
which had built its houses out of the oak forest of 
Bashan, so that it is also called a forest of Bashan, 
because of the amount of oak wood from Bashan, just 
as the temple above [§ 1] is called "Lebanon". For 
Bashan is famous in the Scriptures for oak trees, just as 
Lebanon is famous for cedar and fir. But he calls 
Jerusalem a solid forest, because it was also a solid city, 
as the Romans themselves confessed. 


V. 3. Hear the shepherds howling, for their glorious 
building is desolate. 


005 These are the chief priests and scribes, which 
shall feed the people as shepherds. This one is also not 
spared, but their splendid palace and splendid buildings 
also had to go, which they had prepared as if they 
wanted to live in it forever. 


One hears the young lions roar, for the splendor of 
the Jordan is destroyed. 


(6) These are the rulers and the rich men of 
Jerusalem; all must howl. For there is not one stone left 
upon another. 

7 "The splendor of Jordan" is also a twisted word. | 
think he also means the splendid adornment of the city 
and the building, as with bricks and marble, palm trees, 
brass, silver, gold and similar jewels, which were brought 
from Jordan to Jerusalem and made around Jordan. For 
Solomon had all the vessels of brass cast at Jordan, 1 
Kings 7:46. 


V. 4. 5. Thus says the LORD my GOD: Beware of 
the sheep of the slaughter, for their masters slaughter- 


1938 ed. 4], 318-320. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3S32-3S3S. 


1939 





They sell them, and considering no sin, they sell, and 
say: Praise be to the Lord, | am now rich. 

(8) Here he begins to proclaim and tell of sin and 

guilt, so that they may deserve such destruction. 
These are three: the first, that they teach falsely; the 
second, that they are covetous, and teach falsely for 
covetousness' sake; the third, that they sell Christ, 
and deny, and reject. The first fault he shows by 
saying, "Beware of sheep for slaughter." This is what 
the prophet says to Christ in the person of God, that 
he should feed, and he will find as it is among the 
people, namely, that he will find sheep of choke. For 
Christ found vain wolves, thieves and murderers, that 
is, false teachers among the people, as he himself 
says Joh. 10, 1. 12. Therefore he cheaply calls them 
slaughter sheep. For the Pharisees and scribes, as 
thieves and wolves, slaughtered and strangled them 
with their false doctrine, and even did so safely, so 
that they had no conscience about it, but thought they 
were doing well and rightly. As is the manner of all 
murderous and wolfish teachers, that they want to be 
praised as doing better than all other wholesome 
teachers. Therefore they sin against the Holy Spirit, 
so that their sin cannot be forgiven, but must fall into 
punishment, because they not only sin, but also justly 
defend such sin with all iniquity. For sin must be 
recognized and repented of if it is to be forgiven. 
9 He shows the other guilt by the fact that they sold 
the poor sausage sheep, that is, as St. Peter 2. ep. 
2, 3. speaks: "By avarice they handle the people with 
invented words." Such fiddling is here called 
Zechariah "selling." For the Pharisees had made a 
real fair with their sacrifice [Joh. 2, 13. ff.], just as also 
our clergy have sold nns by the mass, indulgences 
and other services, and have tampered with us, for 
they take money and goods from us, and give us to 
the devil to buy; who gives us the holy merit of 
indulgences and other good works in return, on 
which we build, and so go to hell. And as they have 
no conscience about the false doctrine (as it is said), 
so they have no conscience. 





They think they are doing well, thanking and praising 
God that they are becoming so rich. "Praise be to 
God that we are becoming rich," now we are at ease. 
For because we become rich, it is a sign that [it] 
pleases God so much, even though the contradiction 
is proclaimed here. 

(10) There is much to be said here about how 
masterfully the prophet depicts the belly servants and 
false teachers with their ways, that they are so blind, 
sure, stingy, and how they praise God not for grace 
and mercy, but for the sake that they have become 
rich, that is, for the sake of belly and temporal goods 
and air; otherwise they leave God and God's things 
well satisfied. 


And her shepherds did not spare her. 


(11) That is, they choked them after the soul with 
false doctrine, and robbed them of their goods by 
hypocrisy; and there was no measure, nor cessation, 
nor sparing, but the longer they did it, the more and 
greater they made such murder and robbery, all 
things alike, as also happened to us under the 
papacy. The shepherds should be of the kind and 
goodness that they spare the herd, and lead neatly 
with them. But now they are wolves, of a kind that 
they do not spare. For the wolf has a disgraceful way 
about him, where he comes into a stable, even 
though he may eat his fill with good calm, he does 
not eat a sheep, because he has strangled them all 
beforehand, so that not one lives, he is so insatiable 
and stingy. So also, false teachers do not have 
enough to deceive some people, but want to have 
them all at once completely, and do not rest because 
they hear a pious man bleating against them. 
Therefore he also says above that their lords strangle 
them, as if to say, They have brought the people 
under themselves, and rule over them as lords do 
over hereditary estates, so that no one is allowed to 
protest against them. St. Peter teaches 1 Ep. 5, 3 that 
the shepherds should not rule over the Christians as 
over hereditary property; and Paul 2 Cor. 1, 24. 1) 
does not want to rule over the Corinthian faith.

V. 6: | will no longer spare the inhabitants of the 
land, says the Lord. 


(12) How much such guilt displeases God is indicated 
by the fact that he says here that he also wants to remove 
the hand and tame it, as the 81st Psalm, v. 13, also says: 
"| will let them go into their heart's thoughts. But what 
could be greater anger, since God lets us go according 
to our conceit, takes away His word, and lets men, yes, 
the devil himself be our master? What else can there be 
but vain divisions and disunity of doctrine; after that, from 
disunity of doctrine also follows outward disunity in strife 
and rebellion, as we read in Joseph, how abominable 
divisions and rebellion were among the Jewish people, 
hard before Christ's birth, when they had to fulfill this 
prophecy with it, as follows: 


And, behold, | will leave the people every man in the 
hand of another, and in the hand of his king, to smite 
the land, and will not deliver them out of their hand. 


013 It was the same among the Jews, especially in 
the days of the Sadducees and Pharisees, before the 
birth of Christ: there were all manner of sects, and divers 
kings, as the book of the Maccabees saith. From all these 
they were not saved, but left to have other and other 
kings, until Herod came upon them with his descendants, 
appointed by the Romans. He first fulfilled this prophecy 
and acted abominably among the Jewish people with the 
sword, but the mobs of Pharisees acted even more 
abominably with their tongues and doctrine, and went 
about as if they no longer had a God who respected them. 

14 But | think we should also see something under 
the papacy, how we are divided there into so many 
factions of the clergy, and have been against each other 
in the most violent way, and so much war has arisen from 
it between pope, emperor, kings and princes, that it is 
horrible to read and hear, as if there were no Christ left in 
the church. He has also let us make among ourselves so 
far that nothing but murder of souls and bodies has taken 
place, and indeed a vain diabolical regiment, both with 
seducing and murdering, has gone on mightily. The 





The devil is a murderer and liar, or a deceiver [Joh. 8, 
44], he has proven this honestly in the papacy on us, as 
he is now starting again through the new spirits and 
groups. Where God is not at home, there it goes. 


V. 7. And | tended the strangled sheep for the sake 
of the wretched sheep. 


(15) Now here comes the right shepherd, Christ, and 
says: He accepts the shepherd's office, as the Father 
had commanded him above [v. 4]. For the prophet 
therefore leads Christ in this speech. So he had to be a 
shepherd of the strangled sheep, that is, he preached 
among the mobs of Sadducees and Pharisees, who 
strangled the people with false doctrine. But he did not 
do it for the sake of the strangled sheep, because they 
despised him, but for the sake of the miserable sheep, 
that is, as he himself says Matth. 11, 5: "The poor have 
the gospel preached to them." 


And | took unto me two staves, the one | called 
Gentle, and the other | called Woe; and | tended the 
sheep. 


(16) And here we see the third fault of the Jews, how 
they deny and sell Christ. A shepherd shall have one 
staff. So Christ also presents himself here as a 
shepherd, and takes two staffs to himself, and begins to 
teach and to shepherd the sheep. What these two staffs 
are, however, is interpreted in many ways. But we 
observe, because Christ is here a shepherd, tending the 
sheep, the staves must be nothing else than the 
teaching which he led. For it is also indicated in the text 
that the one staff, when it is broken, signifies a covenant, 
and with the same breaking he confesses that he will no 
longer feed them. So now we must look at what Christ 
led for preaching and teaching, and we will find the two 
staves. For even otherwise in Scripture God's word is 
called a rod, as Ps. 23:4: "Thy rod and thy staff have 
comforted me." And certainly Mosi's staff, when he 
smote the sea and rock with [Ex. 14, 21. 17, 6.] signifies 
GOD's word; and the gospel is called Christ's scepter, 
Ps. 110, 2. and Ps. 45, 7.: "The scepter of thy kingdom 
is a straight scepter." 

17 So now the one staff is the holy one.

Gospel, which is a lovely, funny sermon of grace. 
That is why it is called Noam here, that is, funny and 
fine. We have rendered it "gentle" so that it rhymes 
with the other word. For "gentle" and "woe" are 
probably contrary to each other. The other rod is the 
law, which is a hard, sour and heavy sermon to the 
old man; but Christ masterfully lays down the law in 
Matt. 5:20, and thereby shows that all the 
righteousness of the Pharisees is nothing; item, Matt. 
23:3 ff. and everywhere he punishes them for leaving 
God's law and keeping their own essays. He always 
shows them what the law requires, and punishes 
them for not keeping it, and thus always makes them 
sinners and disgraces them with their holiness. 
Which they could not endure, and it grieved them. 

(18) And indeed it grieveth every man when he is 
made a sinner by the law: there is anguish and 
distress, as St. Paul saith Romans 4:15, "The law 
worketh wrath," and 1 Corinthians 15:56, "The law is 
the power of sins:" that the law is a rod that is called 
woe, distress, and anguish, as the word Choblim is 
in the Hebrew, and is called much or various anguish, 
as a woman is in childish trouble. It is indeed a 
strong, thick staff, even the shillelagh or kenle, with 
which the shepherd throws among the dogs and 
wolves. 

019 Now Christ was so that they would not suffer 
him in any doctrine. If he preached the gospel, he 
had to be a sinner who did not keep the Sabbath or 
the laws of the fathers, a sinner and a tax collector's 
assistant, a glutton and a drunkard. 2c. [Matth. 11, 
19. 12, 2.],who did not give to their fasting, praying or 
almsgiving. If he preached the law, he must be a fool, 
and mocked; yea, became an enemy to him, that he 
chastised them for covetousness and hypocrisy. He 
sunge sweet or sour, it did not help. If he led them 
gently with the rod, they did not follow; if he threw the 
shillelagh woe under them, they were angry, and as 
he himself says Matth. 11, 17: "If we whistle, they do 
not dance; if we mourn, they do not weep." If he 
promises all good things through the gospel, they do 
not want them; if he preaches all evil through the law, 
they despise it. What should he do with such 


The Lord will not do this to the vipers, because he will 
break both staves in the end and let them go, both 
without the gospel and the law, in their arrogance 
after all. 


V. 8. And | destroyed three shepherds in one month. 


These three shepherds are three kinds of teachers 
and governors among the people, which Jeremiah 
Cap. 18, 18. counts according to the glory of the 
wicked: "The priests will not lack the law, nor the wise 
the counsel, nor the prophets the word. But in Christ's 
day, instead of the prophets, there were the scribes, 
who handled the Scriptures and made laws 
according to their own conceit, not, like the prophets, 
according to the Spirit of God. Above these three 
kinds of shepherds were the Pharisees and 
Sadducees; but these were sects and sects, not 
ordered by God, like the three shepherds mentioned 
above, but invented and invented by men. Now these 
three shepherds were of God's order among the 
people; nevertheless they had to perish when Christ 
came. For when he says that he destroyed them in a 
month, he means that by his preaching ministry, 
which he began, he abolished all the teachers of the 
Old Testament as briefly as in a month. For when 
Christ began to teach, Moses was finished with his 
teaching, as Christ himself says Matth. 11, 13: "The 
law and the prophets go until John"; from which time 
on the kingdom of God is preached 2c. 


Because | did not like her, so they did not want 
mine. 

That is soon divorced: | could not stand their false 
doctrine, therefore | condemned them all three, that 
they should count for nothing. But they were annoyed 
by this and did not want to suffer it. So we parted, and 
| let them go. 


V. 9. and said: | will not be careful of you. That which 
dies, die; that which languishes, languish; and the rest 
eat one another's flesh. 


(22) Thatis, if they will not hear me, | must let them 
go, die, pine away, eat one another. As it must be 


1944 Erl. 42, 335-3S7. Interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 11, 9-13. 


where God's word is despised and humanity reigns. For 
there dwells the devil with all his angels, and the spirits 
of the wicked want it so. For they will not let them know 
that Christ must say to them, "I will not watch over you." 
This is what we raw Germans say: "Because you do not 
want to hear me, let the devil and his mother take care of 
you. 


v.10. And | took the one staff, Gentle, and brake it, 
that | might establish my covenant which | had made 
with all nations. And it was taken up that day. 


023 That is, because they would not hear me and my 
gospel, | went and took it also from them, and turned to 
the Gentiles. For this is what he means by saying that he 
has abrogated the covenant (that is, taken the gospel 
from the Jews and shortened it so that it no longer 
reaches them), which he had made to come among all 
the Gentiles, and yet it is broken off and shortened only 
for the Jews. As St. Paul also teaches from Isaiah Cap. 
10, 24. 25. of the abbreviated word, that it does not reach 
to the Jews, nor does it affect them. And Apost. 13, 46. 
Paul confesses that they must turn to the Gentiles, 
because the Jews did not want the word; and thus it 
came to pass that such a covenant was abrogated by the 
Jews, and the rod or staff cut short. And here it may be 
noted that this rod is the gospel, which is the covenant of 
God among all the Gentiles, but taken from the Jews and 
broken off. 


V.11. And the wretched sheep who were watching 
me realized that it was the word of the Lord. 


024 The great multitude fell away, but the wretched 
and lowly kept me, and perceived by the Holy Ghost that 
the rod was the word of God. And indeed, a great glory 
of the wretched is that they saw that the great crowd was 
angry with me, and would not hear me, that they 
nevertheless remained with me, and believed that it [the 
staff] was the word of God, as Peter said to Christ John 
6:68: "Where shall we go? 





W. VI, 3540-3543. 1945 


of eternal life." Yes, this is what the poor and miserable do: 
"For the gospel is preached to the poor", Matth. 11, 5. Is. 
61, 1) 1. 


V. 12 And | said unto them: If it pleases you, bring 
how much | am worth. If not, let it stand. 


(25) This is the prophecy of Christ being sold by Judah 
the betrayer, as Matthew tells us (Matt. 26:15 ff.), all of 
which the prophet sees and hears in his face, and these 
are words that are spoken with great earnestness. As if he 
should say: Not only do you not want to hear me nor suffer 
me, but you are so exceedingly hostile to me that you will 
be glad to be rid of me, even though you sell me for a good 
price, just as your fathers did with the pious Joseph [Gen. 
37:28]. Go on, fill up your fathers' measure [Matt. 23:32]. 
Dear one, let me see how much you value me and sell me. 


And they offered what | was worth, thirty pieces of 
silver. 


26. Christ, who was so highly promised, and so 
expensively commanded to be received, is finally valued 
at thirty pieces of silver, and therefore sold. All of this is 
brought about by the miserable avarice and honor of this 
world. All of this is abundantly fulfilled in the Gospel, 
especially Matth. 27, 9. 


v. 13. And the Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the 
potter, the excellent sum of which | am esteemed of 
them. 


27 The prophet saw this in the vision that Christ did, and 
it was fulfilled afterward. For St. Matthew writes how the 
Jews bought a potter's field for thirty pieces of silver 
[Matth. 27, 7]. This is this potter, to whom these thirty 
pieces of silver were thrown by Christ, that was meant in 
the face, how they were to be given for the field. A 
delicious money (he says) and excellent summa, for which 
| am sold. Aren't they cheap damned people?

And | took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them 
into the house of the LORD to the potter. 

028 Not that the potter is in the house of the Lord, 
but that he casteth them into the temple, that they 
should come to the potter afterward. This prophesies 
that Judas first threw the pieces of silver into the 
temple, and then they came to the potter, as Matthew 
writes. But if anyone here wants to understand that 
the prophet threw thirty pieces of silver into the 
temple as a sign, | will let it happen. But methinks he 
speaketh of a vision, wherein he saw Christ sold, and 
the pieces of silver cast into the temple, and kept for 
sale in the potter's field. 


V.14. And | broke my other staff: woe is me, that | 
should break up the brotherhood between Judah and 
Israel. 

29 Not only the gospel, but also the law is taken 
away. For the Jews now have no more priesthood, 
nor sacrifice, nor right understanding of the law, and 
so the brotherhood that was between Judah and 
Israel is abolished. For by the law the Jews were 
united to each other as brothers, and all Gentiles 
were excluded, as David says Ps. 147, 20: "He has 
not done this to any nation", and Paul Eph. 2, 12. also 
indicates how the Gentiles were without God and 
strangers in the testaments 2c. So this is now also 
gone and abbreviated, by which the Jews were 
bound to each other in the hardest possible way. 


V.15. And the Lord said unto me, Take unto thee the 
testimony of a foolish shepherd. 
(30) By the next vision he prophesied how the gospel 
and the law would be taken away from the Jews 
because of their guilt. Now follows another vision, 
what they will teach instead of the gospel and the law, 
namely no good for the poor souls, but vain doctrine 
for the avarice, Lind says: Zechariah or Christ in the 
vision should take a great shepherd's stuff, as there 
are the staves, horns, bags. For, as is often said, God 
uses to put signs or visions next to his word, to 
strengthen the faith with it. So there must also be two 
visions here as signs: one, from a shepherd with 





The other, of a foolish shepherd and his witness, 
indicate foolish, nonsensical teachers of the Jews, 
who would teach their dreams instead of the gospel. 
That is why they are called foolish shepherds here, 
because they have the name of shepherds and do no 
shepherding. 


V. 16 For behold, | will raise up shepherds in the 
land, who will not look upon that which is wasted, nor 
seek that which is bruised, nor heal that which is 
broken, nor care for that which is whole; but the flesh 
of the fat they will devour, and their claws will rend. 

31 This saying has been interpreted to the 
Antichrist. | let that go. | think he is talking about the 
plague of the Jews, which the Pharisees and their like 
oppressors had, as Christ says about them in Matth. 
23, 4. ff. and Zechariah also proclaims here. For he 
says of the land, that is, of the Jewish land, even 
though the same thing has happened to us through 
the pope, also for the sake of it, that we have not 
accepted God's word beforehand, and now there are 
also spirits of the rotten, who will also play with us in 
this way. God protect us! Amen. What do such 
teachers do? 

(32) First, "they do not look upon the 
brokenhearted," that is, they leave the souls stuck in 
an evil conscience, bringing no food of the gospel to 
them. Secondly, they do not know how to comfort the 
afflicted and fainthearted, that is, they do not seek the 
brokenhearted. Third, they do not heal the broken, 
that is, where a man falls or is infirm, they do not help 
him, do not bear or tolerate it, but with severity and 
sharpness they always drive the poor consciences to 
works. Fourth, they do not care for the healthy either, 
so that it becomes stronger and increases. You can 
read more about this in Ezek. 34, 16 and in the 
Sermon Dominicae 2. post Pascha. But what is fat 
they devour, and tear their claws, that is, their 
preaching is that they suppress everything that is 
something, especially where it is against them, and 
do not do what they want. 


V. 17. 0 idolaters who leave the herd! 


(33) Here you see that he speaks not of one 
shepherd but of many, and calls them

Interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 11, 17. 


W. VI, 3546-3549. 1949 





Idolatrous shepherds, that is, who are not living 
shepherds, who would do their office, but sit as idols, and 
let them be served. He has indeed called them idols 
quite well and fine. For they are idols and idols, and 
nothing else. For they let the herds go as they go; only 
that they eat and tear, so nearly that they leave not a 
claw that they tear not. Look at our bishops, with priests 
and monks, so you have this text glosses, examples and 
fulfillment abundant, if there were no Jewish Pharisees, 
from which it would be understood. 


Let the sword come down on her right arm and on 
her right eye, so that her right arm will wither and her 
right eye will become dark. 


The sword is God's punishment and judgment, so 
that they are so afflicted that they are not capable of any 
good work, Titus 1:16, nor do they teach or understand 
anything salvific. This is their right arm and eye. This is 
also what the 109th Psalm, v. 6, says of them: "Let Satan 
stand at his right hand. But their left arm and left eye is 
strong and healthy. For they do much and 





are almost clever in their carnal sense and own conceit 
to deceive themselves and others; as all false teachers 
are of a kind and happiness 2c. 

35 From this chapter comes the question: why does 
Matthew [Cap. 27, 9] ascribe the text of the thirty pieces 
of silver to the prophet Jeremiah when it is written here 
in Zechariah? Such questions and the like do not trouble 
me much, because they serve little purpose. And 
Matthew does enough that he uses certain scriptures, 
although he does not hit the name exactly, since he also 
uses "sayings in other places", and yet does not use the 
words exactly as they are written. If one can now suffer 
the same, and happens without all danger of the sense 
that he does not lead the words so evenly, what should 
it then hinder, whether he does not set the name so 
evenly? Since more lies in the words than in the name. 
And it is also the way of all apostles that they do so, and 
introduce the opinion of the Scriptures, without such 
quarrelsome, exact diligence and fullness of the text; 
therefore they would be much harder to question, than 
Matthew here about the name of Jeremiah. But he who 
loves idle bickering, let him at least ask; he will find more 
that he asks than that he answers. 


The twelfth chapter. 


V. 1. This is the burden of the word of the LORD 
upon Israel, saith the LORD, which stretcheth out the 
heavens, and layeth the foundations of the earth, and 
maketh the breath of man in him. 

(1) This chapter | understand from the burden of the 
cross, which should go over the right people of Israel for 
the sake of the gospel. For in the previous chapter he 
separated himself from the fleshly Israel, saying [v. 9], "I 
will not shepherd you," but yet he kept the poor remnant, 
saying [v. 11], "And the miserable sheep that kept me 
perceived that it was the word of the Lord." These 
miserable sheep are the real Israel, of which he 
prophesies here that they shall suffer much, and yet in 
suffering they will become the stronger, as Paul says 


2 Cor. 12, 9: "Strength is made stronger through 
weakness. So this chapter is a comforting sermon to 
strengthen the apostles and disciples in all kinds of 
persecutions, which they both, Jews and Gentiles, had to 
suffer in the whole world. For this reason the prophet 
introduces the Lord here with such a title as he has not 
done before, namely, that he is the one who spreads out 
the heavens, establishes the earth, and gives breath or 
spirit to men and governs them. As if to say: Both 
persecutors and the persecuted are in his hand, together 
with all their ability, so that the persecution should not 
harm, but promote and help for the good, "be it tyrants, 
heretics, mobs, devils or his mother.

V. 2. Behold, | will make Jerusalem a cup of 
stumbling for all the nations that are round about. [For 
it will also apply to Judah when Jerusalem is 
besieged.] 


Jerusalem are the apostles and first disciples. The 
nations around are the Gentiles and the Jews, who 
were against them and wanted to devour them like a 
cup, even like a spoon. For the beloved disciples 
were of such low esteem against their enemies, that 
the Jews thought not only to eat them up and devour 
them, but also to devour and kill them as easily as 
one drinks out a cup or spoon. Against such 
presumption the Lord says here: "Go on, try your art, 
drink with confidence: | will set a little drink before 
you, and it shall be right for you; you shall run at me, 
that you may stagger, and you shall not digest the 
little drink as you think. But such staggering is that 
they fall, and will do as the drunken, that they can no 
more. So the Jews and Gentiles fell upon the 
disciples at the last, and were destroyed; some were 
converted by grace, but the rest were destroyed; for 
they were drunken, and had drunken themselves to 
the full upon Jerusalem. 

3rd But that this drinking is the persecution which 
the Jews and the Gentiles have committed, the 
words give that [it] shall also apply to Judah, when 
Jerusalem is besieged. Here he speaks of besieging, 
as the enemies do; therefore these nations around 
must be vain enemies, who not only persecuted 
Jerusalem, that is, the apostles and nobles, but also 
Judah, that is, the whole multitude of Christians, and 
wanted to drink them dry. What is now Rome, which 
also wanted to devour and drink up the Christians? | 
mean, they staggered over it, just like the Jews. It is 
not good to touch the Christians. Oh, if our princes 
and bishops knew what they have in their dungeons! 
They think that they want to make a fresh drink, and 
quench their thirst for blood, and cool their thirst for 
the poor heretics. But how shall they stagger over it! 
How does the pope already stagger, and much with 
him! O of drinking and reeling! Let it be, dear sirs, let 
it be, the drunkenness is too strong for you.

V. 3. At that time | will make Jerusalem a burden to

(4) Another similitude, which signifies the same 
thing. The apostles are to be a loadstone or pushstone 
to all nations, that is, Christendom is not to be 
oppressed; but all who are subject to it are themselves 
to be oppressed, some with grace, others with 
disgrace, as follows: 


All who bring the same upon themselves shall be 
crushed. 


(5) But then they load such a stone upon 
themselves when they lay hold of it, and want to cast 
the Christians out, as one picks up stones and throws 
them out of the garden, as useless and obstructive 
stones. Christians are just as useless, harmful people 
n the eyes of the world, which is why the world wants 
fo throw them away. But she tears and smashes 
herself shamefully over them. For the stone is too big 
and too heavy for the throwers to fail. They can't leave 
it lying there, and yet they can't take it away; so there 
must be tearing and pressing. 


: But all the nations of the earth will gather against 
them. 


(6) He explains himself clearly enough that he 
speaks of the persecution and cross of Christians in 
all the world. And here you hear our consolation, who 
believe in Christ and preach of him, that no one should 
be an enemy to us, except the whole world, as Christ 
also says [Matth. 10, 22]: "You must be hated by all 
men for my name's sake." But it does not help them; 
as follows: 


In that day, saith the LORD, | will make all horses 
afraid, and their riders afraid. 

(7) The power of the world shall not prevail, but 
shall at last be put to shame against the Christian. And 
this is almost the interpretation of the staggering cup 
and burden stone. But he calls them horses and 
riders, because they rely on their power and strength.

V. 4. But over the house of Judah | will have mine 
eyes open, and will afflict all the horses of the nations 
with blindness. 


(8) | will have mercy on the apostles and Christians 
in all their afflictions, and will make their persecutors 
blind and fools, so that all their attempts against the 
Christians will be like playing with a blind man's cow or 
beating pots, so that their persecution will fail and rage 
in vain, and will accomplish nothing, except that their 
blunders will be laughed at, and the gospel will increase 
the more they fight against them. 


Vv. 5. And the princes of Judah shall say in their 
heart, 1) Let the people of Jerusalem alone be 
confident in the LORD of hosts, their God. 


9 That is, in such persecution and crosses the 
apostles and teachers will comfort and strengthen 
themselves and the Christians, not with weapons or 
armor against their persecutors, but in Christ Jesus. For 
they will gladly suffer all tribulations, and let them be 
content that they are strong and confident inwardly in the 
spirit, through the faith of Christ in His word. There 
stands their comfort and strength. 


V. 6 In that day | will make the princes of Judah a 
furnace of fire in the wood, and a torch in the straw, 
and they shall consume, both on the right hand and on 
the left, all the nations round about. 

(10) Not only shall the persecutors rage in vain, but 
the Christians also shall bring forth much fruit by the 
word among all the Gentiles, converting and saving 
many, so that they shall be consumed as a fire burning 
in the midst of dry wood or straw. Thus the fire of the 
Holy Spirit shall consume the Gentiles according to the 
flesh, and make room for the gospel and kingdom of 
Christ everywhere. 


And Jerusalem shall be inhabited for a longer time 
in her place at Jerusalem. 


(11) Nevertheless, the same spiritual Jerusalem that 
has been spoken of so far shall not be desolate or 
despoiled.

It is not to be disturbed, even though all the nations 
oppose it; indeed, it is to remain right where it is, well 
inhabited and full of people, because the princes of 
Judah eat around it like fire in straw. And lest the earthly 
Jerusalem be understood, saith he, Jerusalem shall be 
inhabited in her place, that is, where she is, or where her 
place is, even in all the earth. For where the princes of 
Judah are, there is and is called Jerusalem; there also 
shall Jerusalem be inhabited. 


V. 7 And the LORD shall save the tabernacles of 
Judah, as in the days of old; lest the house of David 
glory, or the inhabitants of Jerusalem, against Judah. 


(12) That he distinguishes here between Judah and 
David's house and Jerusalem, though they are one 
people, and all Christians, is because he wants to show 
how in Christianity there should be no difference nor 
respect of person, but all should be the same, as St. Paul 
teaches Gal. 3:28: "Here is neither Jew nor Greek, male 
nor female, but all are one in Christ" 2c. Therefore this 
salvation, he says, shall be done in such a way that [it] 
shall not be as before and hitherto, when the house of 
David, as the royal tribe, was more noble than the 
citizens of Jerusalem, and the citizens of Jerusalem, as 
dwelling in the holy, great, royal capital, were more noble 
than otherwise the common man in Judah, but all shall 
be equal. For' it shall be a spiritual redemption or liberty’ 
in that none shall be able to boast or flourish against 
another 2c. 1 Cor. 3, 8. 


V. 8: For at that time the Lord will protect the 
inhabitants of Jerusalem, and it shall come to pass 
that he who falls shall be like David; and the house of 
David shall be like the house of God, like the angels of 
the Lord among them. 

(13) Even those who fall, that is, the weak, should do 
as much as the strong David, who, though he was small 
in person and weak against others, yet became a hero 
over the great Goliath and slew him [1 Sam. 17:50]. 
Therefore, because Christians all have the same Christ 
and his Spirit, each one, though he is the least and 
weakest, should be able to do as much. 


1954 Erl. 42, 336-339. interpretations on the prophets 


. W. VI, 3854-3587. 1955 





as the very strongest. For they shall all overcome sin, 
death, the world. They all have the same victory, 
however unequal they are. For there is One Spirit and 
One Christ in them all, who protects them and helps 
them, so that even though they seem to be vain and 
weak men before the world, who are subject to 
everyone, there they shall be vain heroes and victors. 
The word "fall" here means when someone is so 
weak that he must fall, as Ps. 105, 1) 37. says that 
among the tribes of Israel there was no one who fell 
or was weak when they went out of Egypt. Such weak 
are the Christians when they suffer and have 
tribulations; as Paul says 2 Cor. 12, 10.: "When | am 
weak, then | am strongest of all!!!"; and Joel Cap. 3, 
15. "Let the weak say | am strong." 

14. Again, those who are strong, like David's 
house, shall be like God's house, and like the Lord's 
angels among them, that is, those who are such 
strong sigmoid men as David, who in such weakness 
prevail and conquer, they shall be the right house of 
God among Christians, and like angels of the Lord, 
that is, in whom God dwells, and then they can teach 
others rightly and proclaim God's word; that is, they 
will be the right noblest Christians, and like Christ's 
angels and messengers who proclaim His word. 


V. 9: At that time | will remember to destroy all the 
nations that have come against Jerusalem. 


015 And | will avenge and recompense all that the 
Gentiles have done against Jerusalem in their 
persecution; so that the Gentiles shall perish, and my 
Christians shall remain, though they think to destroy 
the Christians, that they may remain; but it shall be 
turned back, that they may be destroyed. Thus the 
Roman Empire has perished and perished. So now 
the papacy also perishes, and all that would destroy 
Christ must perish. But he says that he will think, or 
seek, that is, seek to destroy the Gentiles, to show 
that he will not destroy them. 


1) In the editions: Ps. 78. 


He wants to destroy them suddenly, but with leisure, 
and leave room for repentance, so that he may 
present himself as seeking ways and means of 
destroying them. 


V. 10. But on the house of David and on the citizens 
of Jerusalem | will pour out the spirit of grace and 
prayer. 

(16) But let the Christians remain, not avenging 
themselves, but rather patiently suffering all evil. For 
he will not arm them with weapons, but pour upon 
them the Spirit of grace, that is, the Holy Spirit, which 
makes them have a good conscience, and testifies in 
their hearts that they have a gracious God, and 
forgiveness of sins in the peace of faith [Rom. 8, 15. 
Gal. 4, 6/. About that where they lack something or 
suffer evil, they have the spirit of prayer, which asks 
and cries out for them with sighs, 2) which are 
unspeakable, Rom. 8, 26. So that they may not have 
any weapons nor defense in their affliction, but as St. 
Paul says Phil. 4, 5.f.:"Do not be anxious, the Lord is 
near; but in every matter let your prayer be made 
known before God" 2c. 


Because they will look at me, which one they have 
punctured. 


(17) Here he indicates in short words his suffering 
and death, by which he deserved to be healed of 
such a spirit. And notice that it is the same person of 
God who has spoken so far, and now confesses that 
he will be crushed, that is, crucified, and that he will 
be mourned like a dead man, that is, that he died on 
the cross. So we have from this place that Christ, true 
God and man, had to suffer and die. But because he 
must nevertheless do as much as he has spoken 
before, and give the Spirit, he must of course not 
remain in death, but rise from the dead, and live again 
for eternity. 

18 But when he says, "They shall look upon Me 
whom they have bruised," it is not spoken as if only 
those who crucified Him should look upon Him, but 
thus, "They shall see, and this also shall be preached 
by the gospel to all the world, being formed before 
their eyes, how | was bruised and crucified.

has. And in a nutshell this is the opinion: | will be 
remembered through the gospel, and | will be 
considered in the heart how | suffered and died; 
through this the Holy Spirit will be given for the 
forgiveness of sins. And not only this, but 


They will mourn him as one mourns a first child, 
and will grieve over him as one grieves over a first 
child. 


(19) Such lamentations were fulfilled by his friends 
in the flesh, when they also saw him bodily bruised 
and dead; but such lamentation must go further, and 
come also to those who look upon him in faith through 
the gospel, as he was crucified and died. Which 
lamentation, or bearing of suffering, is nothing else, 
but that, according to his example, every one also 
bears his cross, and thus performs right compassion, 
as Paul saith [2 Tim. 2:12.], "Suffer we with, and so 
shall we also reign with;" and Christ himself [Luc. 
9:23.], "If any man will come after me, let him deny 
himself, and take up his cross, and follow me." This 
is quite a pitying and killing of the old Adam, since a 
Christian always stands in Fahr Leibes, Gutes, Ehre 
und Lebens 2c. For it is not a monasticism, which 
plagues the body with fasting or with a shirt of the 
heart by its own choice, but a serious, great suffering 
and driving of death every hour. For it is called a 
suffering, as over a few firstborn children. Which is 
not a willingly chosen, but a serious, great suffering. 


V.11. At that time there will be a great lamentation 
in Jerusalem, as there was in Hadadrimmon, in the 
field of Megiddo. 


(20) But that it may be seen that there is not in 
Christendom a fictitious or self-chosen suffering and 
cross, he gives here the third similitude of the 
lamentation that happened against the pious king 
Josiah, of which it is written in the book of Chronicles, 
2 Chron. 35, 24. But of the cities, Megiddo and 
Hadadrimmon, you may read in Joshua [Cap. 12, 21]. 


V.12-14. And the land will mourn, every generation 
in particular. The family of the 


House of David especially, and their wives especially. 
[The family of the house of Nathan in particular, and 
their wives in particular. The family of the house of Levi 
in particular, and their wives in particular. The family of 
Shimei in particular, and their wives in particular. So all 
the rest of the families, every one specially, and their 
wives also specially]. 


021 He numbered four generations; two of the 
royal tribe, David and Nathan; two of the priestly tribe, 
Levi and Shimei; and after that he numbered them all 
alike. Each of the generations is to lament in a special 
way, and the women in a special way. According to 
ancient history, the people of Israel were divided into 
twelve tribes, each with its own special laws. So the 
women also had to stand specially in the assemblies, 
as the Jews still usually do. But with the. But by the 
word "special" he means here, as it is now said, that 
each one will carry his own cross for himself. Christ 
has borne his, which is splendidly borne in the 
monstrance, but that is nothing. Christ does not say, 
Take up my cross and follow me, but take up your 
cross 2c. [Luc. 9, 23Z 

The monasteries also have crosses, but it is 
nothing. In the first place, that they are chosen by 
themselves. Secondly, that they are carried by the 
others as one and the same 1). Thus, the Barefoot 
bear St. Francis’ cross, but no one wants to wear his 
own in particular. The Benedictines wear St. 
Benedict's cross, because they martyred themselves 
with the very works and rules that St. Benedict 
martyred himself with, self-chosen and imitated. There 
is no complaining in particular; it is monkey business. 
But everyone flees his own cross, and no one wants 
to carry it. Yes, for this reason they choose suffering 
and crosses, so that they may not carry their own 
cross; they crawl into the monasteries, and have rest 
and good days, leave the other people in toil and work; 
nevertheless, they want to be holier with it than all the 
others. But they will see it well.

The thirteenth chapter. 


At that time the house of David and the citizens of 
Jerusalem will have a free open fountain against sin an 
uncleanness. 


1. all this is said to confirm the previous speeches 
about the new Jerusalem and Christianity, therefor 
he also speaks here about the washing and bathing o 
the priests in the old testament, and holds it agains 
the new testament, where there will be another 
washing and bathing. As if he should say: In the Old 
Testament the priests had for themselves the hand 
basin and the washing basin, where they washed 
themselves when they went into the tabernacle of the 
testimony [2 Mos. 40, 30.31.]. But in the New 
Testament, in Christ's kingdom, not only for the 
priests, but for the whole house of David, yes, for al 
the citizens of Jerusalem, that is, for all kinds of 
Christians, both great and small, a bath and washing 
shall be prepared. For it shall be an open fountain 
open to every man for bathing and washing; not shuf 
up with the court, as the priests’ laver was in the old 
law. In addition it shall not be such a bath, since one 
must carry water into a barrel, which passes away and 
is temporal, and always another is brought in; thereby 
also is meant that such old bath work should cease 
with the time and become different. But here shall be 
a spring, which always springs of itself and is fresh 
and eternally gives water enough, which never stops. 

(2) Although this fountain might be rightly and finely 
understood of baptism, in which the Spirit is given and 
all sins are washed away; but for the sake of the 
quarrelsome mobs, who think nothing of baptism and 
ridicule everything that is pointed to baptism, we alsq 
let it go, and stick to the fact that Christ speaks of 4 
fountain of living water, which the evangelist himsel 
interprets as the Spirit, which those who believe in him 
should receive. This well is now open to all Christians 
and washes away two kinds of filth, sin and impurity. 
3. there are two kinds of sin in us: one that we da 
ourselves; the other is the original sin, which is born in 
us. 





Hebrew calls impurity. And is the uncleanness, since 
Moses in the third book Cap. 12, 4. 5. blames the 
women and children in the six weeks after the birth 
2c. So now the text wants to say this much: The 
ancient priests washed hands and feet externally in 
their hand basin, but now it is to be such a washing, 
as not hands and feet, but all sin and uncleanness is 
washed away, that although one would sin, and still 
have much of Adam and Heva's remaining evil 
inclination about him, yet he shall become clean; for 
it is a daily, public, free washing, that is, an eternal 
forgiveness of sins, which is open to all sinners and 
unclean ones forever, as we Say in faith: "| believe a 
forgiveness of sins"; and 1 John. 2, 2: "Christ is the 
propitiation for our sin, and not for our sin only, but 
also for the whole world" 2c. 


In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, | will cut off the 
names of idols from the face of the earth, and they 
shall be remembered no more. 


Yes, of course, where the right doctrine arises, 
how sins are forgiven without merit, through this open 
spring, and how one is justified before God from the 
same forgiveness of sins through grace, then not only 
all idolatry (which, of course, is conceived solely to 
acquire piety) must cease, but also all other doctrines 
that want to bring us there by works, where this open 
spring alone leads us. For until now idols may have 
been put out of the eyes, but not out of the heart. But 
what is it to break off idols outwardly, and to set up 
many idols inwardly in the heart? as the false 
teachers do, as here also follows: 


For this | will also drive the diviners and the unclean 
spirits from the face of the earth. 


(5) These are the same kind of spirits that are 
unclean and unholy, because they teach their own 
dreams and conceits contrary to the Holy Spirit, even 
though they do not have external idols. 


1960 Erl. 42, 343-346. interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 13, 2-6. 


as the Pharisees and Sadducees were almost holy, and 
had no idols outwardly, but yet were false and unclean 
spirits, preaching their own doctrine, and setting up idols 
in the heart. With these words, that he calls unclean 
spirits, he indicates (as is his way) the old priesthood 
office and makes it spiritual. For the ancient priests had 
much to do with unclean people, as the books of Moses 
teach. Such uncleanness he interprets here as unclean 
spirits, that is, teachers who teach uncleanly and praise 
works without grace. For | know of no other prophet who 
spoke of unclean spirits except this one alone. 


V. 3. So that if anyone continues to prophesy, his 
father and mother who begat him will say to him, "You 
must die, for you speak falsely in the name of the Lord. 


That is, the Christians will be able to judge all spiritual 
things, not only the priests, as in the Old Testament, 
therefore also father and mother will not look at their own 
child, but condemn and banish it, where it will prophesy 
further than it should. For prophesying is called here, as 
the false prophets prophesy; as the following text shows, 
that he speaks falsely 2c. And the sum is: With the 
Christians one will hold above the pure doctrine, no one 
will be considered, he is as close as he wants to be. For 
false doctrine and rot must be to test the others, but they 
will not be obliged. 


And so his father and mother will stab him when he 
knows. 

That is, not with iron weapons, but with the word of 
God. For it will be a spiritual, friendly pricking, as is done 
by father and mother to their child. Just as St. Paul pricks 
the Galatians and Corinthians, and punishes their error 
with God's word. 


V. 4 For it shall come to pass in that day, that the 
prophets shall stand with shame in their visions, 
‘when they prophesy of it. 


8. this is the spiritual pricking, namely, putting them 
to shame, and their prophecy. 


W. VI, 3563-3565. 1961 


punish them, because they shall not stand with it. The 
spirit and the word should hover above in Christianity, so 
that no heresy arises, however nearly it stirs. 


And shall put on no more hard garments, that they 
may deceive, 


9. the prophets wore sackcloth, that is, coarse, simple 
clothes, Isa. 20, 2: "Show your sackcloth" 2c. But the 
false prophets used both the speech and gesture, and 
all the manner of the true prophets, in hypocrisy, to 
deceive the people. Such will be no more with the 
Christians. For it is not asked whether one wears gray or 
red, whether he looks sour or sweet, but whether he 
teaches rightly. The word is the judge here, not the 
appearance of the person; indeed, the more he presents 
himself holy with vestments and clothing, the more he is 
suspect. One does not believe the cap or the plate, but 
only the word. 


V. 5 But shall say, | am no prophet, but a 
husbandman: for | have ministered unto men from my 
youth. 


(10) That is, if he wants to remain in the church, he 
will accept such punishments, and will let himself be 
instructed, and let his prophesying stand, and say: It is 
also true, what do | want to do with prophesying, and to 
be wiser than other Christians? For | am a peasant, that 
is, a wicked man, like the others, and have served men 
from my youth. All this is said: Although Christians can 
all prophesy and teach, 1 Cor. 14:31, they will not exalt 
themselves one above the other and act disorderly, or 
create mobs and heresy, but one will humbly yield to the 
other, and each will consider himself the least and the 
worst. For it shall be fatherly and kindly with 
punishments, and childlike and hearty with obeying, if 
they will otherwise remain in the church. If not, they are 
let go. 


But if they say to him, What are these wounds in 
your hands? What are these wounds in thy hands? he 
shall say, Thus am | smitten in the house of them that 
love me. 


1962 En. 42, p4e-348. interpretations on the prophets. Ww. VI. 356S-3S6S. 


(11) That is, he will be patient when he is so 
punished, and will not be angry about it, nor will he 
oppose it. Why should | not suffer it gladly (he says), 
if they mean it so well and cordially with me? They 
are kind blows; 1) they are better than the flattery of 
the enemy. See how friendly it is among Christians 
when someone errs or stumbles and is not stiff- 
necked, as St. Paul also teaches the Galatians, Gal. 
6:1: "Brethren, if anyone is hurried with a fault, teach 
him with a gentle spirit. 


V. 7 Sword, arise upon my shepherd, and upon the 
man that is beside me, saith the LORD of hosts. Strike 
the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be 
scattered, and | will turn my hand to the little ones. 


(12) How does this rhyme with one another, that 
he says here of the king Christ how he is to suffer? 
Answer: He has now said how Christians will be 
humble among themselves, and gladly let themselves 
be beaten and punished where they err and sin, 
which they do for Christ's service. For He Himself also 
gave Himself to be beaten, without any blame, also 
for this reason, that Christ's kingdom should not be 
regarded as worldly; for it is to be a very evil kingdom 
in the sight of the world, as Paul says in 1 Cor. 1:23: 
"We preach Christ crucified, an offense to the Jews 
and a foolishness to the Gentiles." For even the 
disciples themselves were offended at Him [Matth. 
13, 57.], as Christ says Matth. 26, 31. and says: "You 
will all be offended at Me this night. For it is written: | 
will strike the shepherd" 2c. 

(13) Therefore the opinion is, O sword, open up; 
this is the power of darkness (as Christ calls it). For 
Pilate and the Jews had the sword and regiment in 
the land, but still they could do nothing until God 
imposed [it], as Christ also confessed before Pilate 
[John 19:11], "You would have no power over me." 
Thus He hereby gives leave and power to the sword 
over Christ, and also comforts us that no harm can 
come to us unless He permits and imposes it. 


1) In Latin: avaautinrn ptaAne. 





1963 


14. he calls Christ his shepherd, and the man next 
to him, qui apud me, vel juxta me est. This | 
understand, that Christ is the right one shepherd in 
Christianity, and at the same time with the Father in 
eternity, as John says: "The Son in the bosom of the 
Father" [Joh. 1, 18.]. But whoever wants to, may also 
understand it in this way, that God was always with 
him and with him to do great signs and wonders, until 
the hour of his suffering came. 

(15) But as at that time the disciples were vexed 
and scattered at the suffering of Christ, so it will be to 
the end of the world. For Christ must still be slain, and 
always suffer the sword in his spiritual body, which 2) 
is Christendom, and is always much vexed, for it is a 
kingdom of vexation. But still he turns to the little 
ones, just as he says above [Cap. 11, 11.) he also 
says about the wretched sheep, that they pay 
attention to his word. So also here: if everything that 
is great, high, learned, holy, powerful and rich among 
the Jews is offended at him, yet the lowly, poor, 
miserable sinners and disciples stick to him, and he 
also accepts them and turns to them. 


V. 8 And it shall come to pass, that in the land (saith 
the LORD) two parts shall be cut off, and perish: but 
the third part which remaineth, | will burn with fire, and 
will purify it as silver is purified, and sweep it as gold 
is swept. 


(16) The two parts are just the large part of those 
who are angry, one part of which is deterred by the 
cross and persecution, so that they are cut off, and 
the other part is seduced by unclean spirits and false 
teachers, so that they perish. But the third part 
remains firm in the pure word, and both are purified 
and swept away by persecution and temptation of the 
spirits. These are the righteous, though they are few. 
For the cross drives out many, but false teaching 
even more, therefore they are called two parts. But 
the third that persevereth shall be saved, as follows: 


2) Erlanger: welchs.

v. 9. Then they will call on my name, and | will hear 

them. | will say, Itis my people; and they will say, Lord

(17) For they shall be pure and upright in the faith, 
without all hypocrisy. They know how to preach the 
name of the Lord. (For this is called in Hebrew the 
name of the Lord. 





call). For they do not preach their own name, like the 
heretics and hypocrites, therefore they are also His 
people, and have Him as their God, that is, all that 
God is and has, for they are His children and heirs. 
So this text proclaims the cross and sorrow that 
arises in Christ and His people. Blessed is he who 
endures to the end [Matth. 10, 22]. 


The fourteenth chapter. 


Vv. 1.2 Behold, the time cometh unto the LORD, that 
thou shalt be a spoil and a prey. For | will gather all 
nations against Jerusalem to battle. And the city shall 
be taken, and the houses plundered, and the women 
ravished. 


Here | am caught in this chapter, because | am not 
sure what the prophet is talking about. So far it has 
been understood of the Antichrist and the last 
judgment. But because such an interpretation exists 
everywhere, presented by many, | will leave it here, 
because it is not good enough for me at all ends. 
Whoever wants to keep it, will also find it in Lyra. | will 
also present my understanding, even though it is not 
certain enough in many places, and finally let the 
Holy Spirit have the mastery. 

2 First, because he said of Christ and his kingdom 
how it should be swept away and increased by 
adversity, he now prophesies how it should be with 
the unbelieving Jews who took offense at him and 
crucified him, and says that the city of Jerusalem 
should be disturbed by the Romans, who had all 
kinds of Gentiles among them and went against 
Jerusalem with them. As Christ also proclaimed Luc. 
19, 41, when he wept over the city. According to this 
opinion the text is easy. For the day of the Lord is 
called the day when the Lord's death and torture was 
smelled on the Jews by the Romans, who were 
otherwise hostile to the Jews. 





And half of the city will be taken away, and the rest 
of the people will not be driven out of the city. 

(3) This is almost what happened to Jerusalem: 
one part of the city was killed by famine, pestilence, 
and the sword, and could not escape. But the other 
part is carried away captive among all the nations 
unto this day. 


V. 3. But the Lord will go out and fight against these 
nations, as he is wont to fight in the time of battle. 

4 Here it begins to sound as of the last judgment. 
But, as | have said, | now leave such understanding, 
and hold that he shall say, as after Jerusalem was 
destroyed, Christ shall go forth, and by the gospel 
shall fight against such heathen. For at the last 
judgment there will not be much disputing, since no 
one will be able to stand against him. But by the 
gospel he contends, as he is wont to do, that is, by 
his spirit, and not by weapons. In such disputes he 
has also had adversaries who have defended 
themselves vigorously. 


V. 4 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the 
mountain of oil which is before Jerusalem eastward. 

5. at the last judgment Christ will not stand with 
feet on the mountain of oil, but will float in the air ina 
cloud, as St. Paul writes [1 Thess. 4, 17]. Therefore | 
hold this: Because Christ apart from Jerusalem, on 


1966 


‘Ent. 42, 350-352. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3572-3874. 


1967 





The prophet wants to say that there the battle of the 
gospel should begin from Mount Olivet, when he 
gave the last command to the disciples to go into all 
the world and preach, Matth. 28, 19 and Marc. 16, 
15, so that it is indicated that Christ no longer wants 
to reign in the fleshly Jerusalem, but completely 
outside of the fleshly city in all the world, from Mount 
Olivet on. 


And the mountain of oil will split in two in the 
middle, from the exit to the descent, very far from each 
other, so that one half of the mountain will give itself 
about midnight, and the other about noon. 

(6) When this shall come to pass at the last day, 
where shall the feet of the Lord stand in this 
mountain? But as the name Jerusalem is given to the 
people and persons who dwell in it, so Jerusalem 
above [Cap. 2, 4.) is described as coming as far as 
the world, that is, Christ, the apostles and disciples 
who were at Jerusalem should come as far as the 
world, so | also consider here that the name "Mount 
of Olives" is given to the people, that the disciples 
who were with Christ last on Mount of Olives should 
thus divide themselves into the whole world, very far 
from each other, toward morning, evening, noon and 
midnight; That as there was another Jerusalem 
spread abroad, so should there be another mountain 
of oil divided into all the world. 


V. 5 And ye shall flee from such a valley between 

my mountains. For the valley between the mountains 
will reach Azal. 
007 How shall they escape, or who shall escape? For 
he hath said that Jerusalem shall then be desolate 
and desolate. | consider, therefore, that, because the 
Mount of Olives is divided into all the world, the 
desolate, desolate valley is nothing but the desolate, 
desolate synagogue, or Judaism. From it all the 
devout Jews who become Christians will flee and join 
the disciples. For there is a valley between my 
mountains," he said, "that is, between the cleft 
mountains of oil, which he now calls his mountains, 
as he makes them with his clefts. But what the azalea 
is, | Know not; in German it is called: nahe bei, though 
it is otherwise the name of a city. | 


eighth, he wants to say: The desolate part, where the 
Jews sit between the two mountains, and are now 
neither Christians nor Jews, will stretch far and near, 
so that fes) almost all Jews understand, because few 
have converted to Christ. 


And shall flee, as ye fled before the earthquake in 
the days of Uzziah king of Judah 2c. 


In the earthquake the people flee from cities and 
houses, much more will they flee in such an 
earthquake, when the mountain of oil is thus cut 
apart, and leave Judaism, so that they may remain 
with Christ and in Christ 2c. The prophet Amos also 
speaks of the earthquake in the time of King Uzziah 
[Cap. 1:1]. 


Then the Lord my God will come, and all the saints 
with him. 


9 This is fine for the last day. But because the 
other texts do not read like this, | will now stick to the 
fact that Christ, who went out to the conflict through 
the gospel, also comes through his spirit, together 
with his apostles and preachers, and all Christians in 
one heap, much different than when he came out of 
the desert with his saints, of which Moses sings in the 
5th book Cap. 32, 10. 


V. 6. At that time there will be no light, but cold and 
frost. 


(10) What if Christ should come without light, in 
cold and frost? But this is that Christ's word and Spirit 
makes Christians quite unsightly before the world 
without light and heat, but in the darkness and frost 
of persecution. Otherwise Christ will come with fire 
on the last day, 2 Thess. 1, 8. 


And shall be a day known unto the LORD, neither 
day nor night. 


(11) There he interprets himself. There will be no 
light, yet there will be a day, that is, a spiritual day, 
which no one can see except the Lord alone. For he 
is the sun himself, who makes this day in the hearts 
of the faithful. For they must believe it, therefore it is 
neither day nor night to speak in the natural way, but 
no light at all.

14, 7-10. W. VI, 3574-3577. 1969 





V. 7. But about evening it will be light. 


12. turn around: All the days of the world become 
dark at evening when night comes, but this day becomes 
light only when it becomes evening and night comes, so 
that this day is dark during the day but light at night. 
Therefore it is called such a day, which is neither day nor 
night, as other days are. Now the evening is the end of 
the world, when faith shall cease, and the eternal light 
shall be revealed. 


v. 8: At that time fresh waters will flow to 
Jerusalem; half of them toward the sea on the morrow, 
and the other half toward the last sea. 


013 How? If Jerusalem is destroyed, how can fresh 
water flow out of it? But it is the spiritual Jerusalem from 
which the Holy Spirit flows through the gospel, as John 
4:14 indicates the Holy Spirit through water. Now 
Jerusalem lies between two seas, the dead sea in the 
morning and the great sea in the evening, and water had 
to be led into Jerusalem. How then is it that fresh springs 
should run out of Jerusalem over so many mountains at 
both ends, and so far away as into the two seas? Not 
otherwise, for as it is said: the Spirit pours out toward the 
east and toward the west, that is, to reconcile with God 
His wrath, which He showed in the dead sea over 
Sodom; and below Himself, into the world, to comfort 
and strengthen in the midst of persecution and suffering. 


And will last both, summer and winter. 


Other waters dry up in the summer, but these waters 
flow forever, that is, the Spirit endures forever, never 
ceasing to propitiate God's wrath and comfort suffering 
Christians. 


v. 9. and the LORD will be king over all the earth. 


15 Not only over Judah and Jerusalem, as has 
happened until now, but in all the world, Ps. 2:8, which 
will happen through the fresh waters 2c. 





At that time, the Lord will be only One, and His 
name only One. 


16 Until now, God has been divided into many gods 
and given many names; for, in ancient times, the Jews 
called him Baal, Astaroth; the pagans called him Jupiter, 
Saturnus; the Babylonians called him Bel and Nebo, and 
so on. For since all the world knows something about 
God, every man goes and devises a service according to 
his own conceit. This should please God, and must 
therefore receive from us a form and name, just as in our 
time we have also separated Christ, that one serves Him 
under the rule and name of St. Francisci, the other St. 
Dominici, and so on. Each one has chosen a way and a 
work, and all this under the one Christ. Summa, to 
establish and follow sects and cults in faith, that is, to 
divide God into many gods and to give Him many names, 
even though He remains simple in Himself. When sects 
and divisions cease, and one serves God in one spirit, 
faith, word and being, then God is called One, and His 
name One, which is done through the Gospel 2c. 


v.10. And they shall go throughout all the land, as 
on eyiem plains, from Gibeah to Rimon, toward 
Jerusalem at noon. 


17 Gibeah is on the north side of Jerusalem, in the 
tribe of Benjamin. Rimon is toward the south in the tribe 
of Simeon. He said, "In those days it will all be a bad field, 
just as if there were a bad road and a bad field from 
Gibeah to Rimon, over such a mountain. That is all so 
much said: It shall all be equal and even, united and bad, 
no longer be such divisions, sects and differences, as 
also Isaiah Cap. 40:4: "Every mountain and hill shall be 
made low, and every valley shall be filled. What is 
crooked shall be made right, and what is uneven shall be 
made bad," so that all things may be equal under Christ, 
God granting that if one goes from Gibeah to Rimon, or 
from Rimon to Gibeah, one will come to Jerusalem in a 
bad field. For there shall be no more distinction of sects. 
And though there be many ministries of the spirit 


1970 Erl. 42, 335-837. 
And if one should go to Gibeah, the other to Rimon, 
the one to the other, all should come to Jerusalem in 
one accord, on a fine, even, level field, without all 
trouble and offence, each with his gift to serve the 
one Lord. 


For it will be exalted and inhabited in its place. 

18 That is, it shall be high on a mountain called 
Christ, that it may be seen and approached round 
about in the plain. It shall also be well built. But now 
not in the tribe of Benjamin, where it was before, and 
now is disturbed, as he proclaims above [v. 2], but in 
its place as far as the world is 2c. 


From the gate of Benjamin to the place of the first 
gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower 1) of 
Hananeel, to the king's winepress 2c. 


019 Of these gates and towers thou mayest read 
in Ezra and Nehemiah. He does not mention all the 
gates, but the most important ones, which are in the 
four places opposite the four places of the world, 
midnight, morning, noon and evening, so that 
Jerusalem will be in all the world. For Lyra also 
introduces an old Jewish rabbi who writes that 
Jerusalem shall be so great in Messiah's day that her 
walls shall be the end of the world. The text of 
Zechariah forced him to speak about this. 


V.11. And they shall dwell within, and there shall be 
no more building: for Jerusalem shall surely dwell. 


20. the holy new Jerusalem shall be full of people, 
and yet all of them holy and pure, that there be no 
condemnation, that is, that none be put out for his 
iniquity; for they are all holy and righteous in Christ; 
and not only righteous and holy, but also safe. For 
they have a good conscience in Christ, and are joyful 
and in great peace.

V.12. And this shall be the plague, that the LORD 
shall afflict all nations which have fought against 
Jerusalem: Their flesh shall rot, and they shall stand 
upon their feet, and their eyes shall rot in their holes, 
and their tongue shall rot in their mouths. 


The persecutors of the Christians shall not go 
unpunished, and so they shall perish wonderfully, 
that is, they shall decay in themselves, lose strength 
and power, even when they think they are still 
standing. When the Romans perished, it was not 
known how. They had enough meat, that is, enough 
land and people, and they were well off. There was 
no lack of eyes, that is, of wise, sensible rulers. There 
was no lack of tongues, that is, of teachers and wise 
counselors. 2) It did not help yet. Just as Troy is 
described as being disturbed at the very time when 
she had the finest people. And Jerusalem, when she 
was most powerful, she also perished. Babylon in the 
same way. Why? Because God ceased to be with 
them, and the hour had come for them to be punished 
and destroyed, and, as he says here, for the tongue 
to be put in the mouth, and the eyes in holes, and the 
body on the legs to decay, that is, for power and 
strength, happiness and victory to be taken away 
from them. When this happens, it shall follow: 


V. 13: In that day the Lord will make a great tumult 
among them, and one shall take another by the hand, 
and lay his hand on another's hand. 


(22) That is, when they have thus become 
powerless, they shall also be divided among 
themselves, and shall attack one another, that they 
may soon perish, even as it came upon the Roman 
empire. The Lord will bring such turmoil upon them 
when he removes his hand and no longer keeps the 
peace. And not only will the heathen destroy one 
another in this way, but they will also be destroyed. 


V. 14. Judah will also fight against Jerusalem. 


(23) Thatis, in Christendom there will also be sects 
and mobs, that they may also be among

Interpretation of Zechariah (1.), Cap. 14, 14-19. 


W. VI, 3580-3582. 





The heretics have always been at odds with one 
another, even though they rage in unity against the 
true Christians. | fear that this will also happen in 
Germany one day, because the tyrants are 
persecuting the gospel so horribly. For the spirits of 
the mobs are already divided among themselves, and 
they destroy themselves quickly, even though they 
are united against the gospel. 


So all the goods of the Gentiles around will be 
gathered up, gold, silver, clothing, beyond measure. 

24 That is, their wealth, which they have gathered 
until now, for which they also raged against the 
gospel, will be taken from them, just as the Jews lost 
land and people, over which they fought against 
Christ. The same will be the fate of all belly servants 
and clergymen who now persecute the gospel out of 
great concern for their property and possessions. 
They must perish and lose everything shamefully. 


V.15. And such a plague will also come upon the 
horse, the mule, the camel, the elephant, and all the 
animals that are in the army, as this plague is. 

(25) That is, they also shall perish, and decrease, 
and be spoiled; so that all the power and strength of 
the Gentiles, which they have exalted and defied 
against the poor, miserable Christians, shall perish. 


V.16. But all the remnant of all the nations that went 
against Jerusalem shall come up yearly to worship the 
King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of 
tabernacles. 

The Gentiles who do not remain in unbelief with 
the others will be Christians and serve Christ; and 
before others (he says): They will keep the feast of 
tabernacles yearly. Why not the feast of Easter or 
Pentecost? He said enough above that Jerusalem 
should be disturbed, therefore this must also be a 
new feast of tabernacles in the new Jerusalem. Well, 
the new tabernacle is that the Christians live here on 
earth as guests and wanderers, and think to come to 
the future city, as those who live in tabernacles think 
to stay there for a short time, as eight days, and 
always return home. The 





is nothing else than that the Christians here on earth 
live joyfully in faith and hope, and wait for the future 
blessedness. To such a feast they will go up 
annually, that is, daily, and practice such faith and 
hope 2c. 


V.17. But what generation on earth shall not come 
up to Jerusalem to worship the King of hosts, the 
LORD of hosts, it shall not rain upon them. 

27. those who refuse to keep such a spiritual feast 
are those who seek the belly and themselves more 
than Christ, because the word falls among thorns and 
is choked, so that it does not bear fruit [Luc. 8:7]. On 
them shall come the punishment, that it rain not; that 
is, for their ingratitude the word of God shall be taken 
from them at last. 


V.18. And if the family of Egypt does not go up and 
come, it will not rain on them. 

(28) Why do the Egyptians ask for it? They are not 
allowed to have rain, nor do they ever have rain, as 
Moses writes [Deut. 11:10]. But he includes the 
Egyptians in particular, so that the rain should be 
understood spiritually, which is also necessary for the 
Egyptians, as well as for all the Gentiles. 


This will be the plague, so that the Lord will plague 
all the Gentiles who do not come up to keep the Feast 
of Tabernacles. For this shall be the sin of the 
Egyptians, and of all the Gentiles, that they come not 
forth to keep the feast of tabernacles. 

(29) He speaks much of this plague and of the 
feast of tabernacles, that it may be counted evil for 
sin, which shall not go unpunished. But these words 
are not in vain. For indeed, there is no greater grace 
on earth where God's word is preached; again, no 
greater sorrow where God's word is not preached, 
just as Isaiah 5:6, 7 proclaims the same plague on 
the vineyard. For where God's word does not rain, 
there can be no good, neither thought, word, nor 
work, and all toil and labor is lost, as the labor of 
Jews, pagans, monks and priests is always lost.

1974 Erl. 48, 380-382. interpretations on the prophets 


V. 20. At that time the armor of the horses will be 
holy to the Lord. 


It is a mockery (says St. Jerome) that in this place 
some say that the prophet speaks of the nail of Christ, 
from which Queen Helena had a bridle made for the 
Emperor Constantine's horse, because the Latin 
says: Quod est super frenum equi, sanctum erit 
Domino. But the prophet wants to say so much that 
in Christianity also the laity, as the secular authorities 
with their office, should be holy and pleasing to God 
as well as the priests, so that not only the priests (as 
before), but also the secular rulers should be holy, 
because they also serve God, Rom. 13, 4. For this 
they may believe and be Christians as well as the 
others, as we read from Captain Cornelio, Apost. 10, 
31. ff, and of Paulo Sergio, the bailiff, Apost. 13, 7. 
and afterwards of kings and princes. Summa, all shall 
be subject to Christ, both great and small, both high 
and low. 


And the caldrons in the house of the Lord will be 
like the basins before the altar. 


31. In the Old Testament, only the vessels 
consecrated and ordered for the altar and worship 
were holy, but in the New Testament, all the vessels 
or pots in the whole house of the Lord are to be as 
holy as the basins of the altar were there, that is, in 
the New Testament, all Christians who are at worship 
are to be holy, consecrated, and fit for the priesthood, 
so that henceforth there will be no difference between 
the consecrated and the unconsecrated, because 
they are all consecrated with Christ's Spirit, yes, 
which is even more:' 


V.21. For all the cauldrons (or pots), both in 
Jerusalem and Judah, will be holy to the LORD of 
hosts. 

That is, they shall all be priests through and 
through, and holy. Even though they are not in office 
and service, they are consecrated to it. For in the law 
not all pots were holy. 


That all those who want to sacrifice will come and 
take them and cook them inside. 


. W. VI, 3582-3585. 1975 

That is, the old priesthood with its holiness shall 
be finished and have an end, for the new priesthood 
makes everyone holy and consecrated who believes. 
Therefore, he who only wants to sacrifice, that is, 
preach and serve God, takes whatever Christian he 
wants, who can teach and cook him to be prepared 
and sacrificed to God, according to the old man, 
Rom. 12, 1. For they are all priests and taught by God 
[Is. 54, 13. Joh. 6, 45.]. And here the prophet himself 
comes first, and interprets the old priesthood with its 
office, lest the frivolous spirits come and pretend to 
great art with their allegories and interpretations, just 
as now our red-blooded spirits boast that it is a 
delicious thing to know what imago et veritas is, and 
that it must come forth what the old priesthood is. Just 
as if these were the main pieces, or were otherwise 
never brought forth, when this prophet himself has 
uncovered many of the Old Testament figures, as he 
does here with the priesthood, and above with the ark 
of Moses, and the like. . 


And there shall be no more Cananite in the house 
of the LORD in that day. 


(34) In times past, some Canaanites remained 
among the people, as we see in Joshua [Cap. 16, 10. 
17, 12.) and Judges [Cap. 1, 29. 30.), that there was 
not a pure people of Israel in the land, but in Christ's 
time no unholy person shall not be in Christendom; 
they must all be of one mind and faith, that neither 
heretics nor other false Christians remain among 
them. Yes, they separate themselves like chaff, Ps. 
1,4. 

So these last parts of the text move me, that | 
understand this chapter not of the last judgment, but 
full of Christianity. For all cauldrons are to be 
sanctified, and the armor of horses is also to be 
sanctified, and that sin should be to despise the feast 
of tabernacles, and almost all of the pieces, without 
the one about the mountain of oil that was cut in 
pieces, do not rhyme well with the last judgment, but 
quite well with Christianity, which lives on earth in 
faith and word. Whoever can do better, has room and 
arbor enough for it. May Christ help and protect us in 
his simple mind. Amen.

Preface on the Prophet Zechariah. 


From the preceding prophets and from Haggai it can be 
seen what Zechariah wanted, and also what all the 
prophets who prophesied to the Israelite people after the 
Babylonian captivity intended, namely that they would 
deal above all with one thing, that the remnants of the 
people, scattered and miserably afflicted by the 
captivity, would be strengthened and encouraged, so 
that they would not despair, would not put their trust in 
the divine promises that were promised to them by the 
future king. It would happen that they would be fulfilled; 
the King Christ would finally come, no matter how 
desperate the situation was, how much the land was 
devastated, the people scattered and miserably 
perished. In order for this to happen, the people had to 
be restored according to the flesh, your future King 
Christ was promised. And in order that the prophet might 
persuade the people of this, he awakens their faith by 
many visions and speeches, by all of which he wants to 
strengthen the wavering hearts, so that in such a 
perilous state of affairs they will not harbor mistrust, but 
will take a hand, begin to cultivate the land, and bring to 
pass the before 


The Lord will help them, as he has promised. 

The purpose of all this is that we should know that 
God does not want anything to be done among His 
people, and that He does not approve of anything unless 
His word is given beforehand, by which we become 
completely certain of His will. But he does not approve 
what we do according to our own counsel or by 
ourselves, however godly it may seem to us. And this is 
done so that he may make us quite sure in our 
consciences that what we do at his command pleases 
him in every way, while what we devise for ourselves 
without the word of God is highly displeasing. And those 
who want to establish something in matters of godliness 
without God's word cannot be certain in their 
consciences that it will please God. The consciences 
must necessarily always waver and confess that they do 
not know whether the work is pleasing to God. 
Therefore, the prophet strengthens the consciences 
with a rich and diverse 





*Of the more recent finds about this prophet (four different manuscripts) we give here only the Altenburg manuscript, which contains 
the first thirteen chapters. The Zwickau manuscript No. 6 brings only pieces that reach up to the sixth verse of the tenth chapter. In between, 
there are large gaps, e.g. the sixth and seventh chapters are completely missing; only the first four chapters are complete. The Erlangen 
edition has included only the ninth and tenth chapters of this manuscript in the exk.]. oxp., tom. XXVII, p. 420 The Weimar edition brings 
everything that this manuscript offers in the form of notes to the Altenburg manuscript. Another Zwickau manuscript, No. 36, contains a 
"tediously circumstantial elaboration" of what is offered about the first four chapters in the manuscript just mentioned, about which the Weimar 
edition makes this judgment: "This manuscript has no value in Zechariah as a reworking of a piece of the previous one. Therefore, the Weimar 
edition gives as a sample only the preface, vol. XIII, p. 670 ff, and in notes what has been preserved from the Hall manuscript. In contrast,

1978 L. xxvm, 8-10. interpretations on the prophets. 


1979 





Comfort by the word of God this wretched people, who, 
oppressed by the lamentable captivity, hardly dared to 
breathe, so that the consciences would be completely 
sure that God would stand by them and give prosperity 
to what they had begun, since he testified to his will with 
such rich words. And this intention of the prophet can be 
inferred from the circumstances. For the things of Israel 
stood at that time [g" that in the whole environment of 
the Jewish country also not a people was, which did not 
persecute Israel most bitterly, mock, rejoice over the 
accident of Israel, namely over the fact that its 
possession and property were destroyed, Israel itself 
however into the captivity was led. There was nothing 1) 
that could have given Israel hope of restoration. 
According to the judgment of the flesh it seemed quite 
impossible that the kingdom should be restored, receive 
aking, and become glorious as never before. There was 
no room for hope. Therefore the prophet strengthened 
the so weak and discouraged people by many speeches 
and visions and nourished their faith. 

But all this is written for our instruction, so that we may 
learn that God is absolutely so, that he proclaims things 
that are quite impossible for our comprehension and our 
reason, that nothing rhymes less with each other than 
his word and our judgment. They even argue constantly 
with one another. 


1) In our template: garbage nou ernt. It seems to us that riori must be 
erased. 





so that afterwards, when the things that have been 
promised have come to pass and have been 
accomplished, our glory may perish, but He may be 
glorified who makes everything out of nothing, out of 
impossible things quite possible, since nothing is 
impossible for Him, as Christ says, so that after our free 
will, our counsel has come to shame, we may ascribe 
everything to Him. For so much is lacking that something 
is owed to our powers, that they are even something that 
is highly contrary to the word of God; they do not believe 
the word, they consider it impossible. Thus the prophet 
here beautifully shows this weakness of the hearts in the 
people, who are frightened by the difficulty of the matter, 
by the uncleanness of the priest 2c., as is written in the 
third chapter. But the prophet takes all things out of their 
sight and refers them to the word of God: God will fulfill 
his word, even if all creatures oppose it, since he makes 
life out of death, righteousness out of sin, the greatest 
riches out of the greatest lack, in short, everything out of 
nothing, and calls that which is not, that it may be 2c. [It 
is most necessary that in every challenge we keep this 
in mind, that we trust in God, learn to command 
ourselves to him, that he will snatch us away from all 
reasoning, that we would not even have dared to hope 
for it. Namely, this is the cause and custom of prophecy, 
as it can also be useful to us, so that we do not think we 
are merely reading a history when we read what 
happened to Israel. 


[The first chapter. ] 


V. 1. In the eighth month of the eighth year of King 
Darius. 
Above in the beginning of the Haggai | reminded that 
these two, Haggai and Zechariah, had been 
contemporaries. Haggai, however, preceded him by two 
months, which is indicated by the title of both; Haggai 
asked in the sixth month, the latter in the eighth month 
of the second month. 





Year [of Darius] prophesied. And under Haggai the 
foundation of the temple was laid. Zechariah comes at 
the very beginning of the work and exhorts them to be 
diligent in the work they have undertaken, so that their 
hearts will not waver, but will continue steadfastly, 
without being frightened by the nations dwelling around 
them, which are all rising up in the land of the Lord.

that they should not continue, for they had resisted them 
often and very fiercely. Against all this, | say, he calls 
them to be sure, the Lord will be their protector against 
all enemies 2c. | have also said in Haggai which Darius 
| take this to be, namely Darius Longimanus, who 
succeeded Cambyses and the sons of Cambyses in the 
reign. But this one was favorable to the Jews, which is 
evident from Ezra, since Ezra writes in the first book 
[Cap. 6) that Darius sent a letter that the people should 
not be prevented from completing the building that had 
been started 2c. The seventy interpreters, however, 
count the kings of the Persians differently than | counted 
them in the table | published, but | do not think | was 
mistaken. For about this matter the historians are 
divided, and perhaps it is still undecided which of them 
has the more correct opinion 2c. 


V. 2. The Lord was angry with your fathers. 


[Vulgate: lratus est Dominus iracundia.] A Latin 
would not have added iracundia, but it is added after the 
Hebrew manner. For this is how the Hebrews speak: | 
rejoice with joy, | desire with desire, | am angry with 
anger, which a Latin simply says: gaudeo, desidero, 
irascor rejoice, | lament, | am angry). But he begins his 
prophecy with the repetition of the past calamity; he 
reminds and scares that they should not be faithless 
against God's word, as their fathers had been, as if to 
say: you have the clear word of God, likewise God has 
given you two witnesses, Haggai and me. Therefore, you 
must obey this word, which is more valid than all 
sacrifices. But you are frightened by the difficulty of 
obeying, by the impossibility of the matter, by the 
exceedingly bitter enemies, by the present destruction of 
all goods. But do not worry about all this, beware, these 
shall not be causes that keep you from obeying GOtte, 
as your fathers did not obey GOtte. 

So the flesh always has such things that it can pretend 
and put against it that it is

do not follow the word of God, as also those in the 
Gospel (Luc. 14, 18. ff.) 1) say: "| have taken a wife, | 
have bought [five] yoke of oxen, | cannot come." And 
even nowadays many fear for their wives, children, 
goods, friends, positions of honor, good reputation, 
otherwise they would freely confess the gospel. But 
there must be no causes by which led, we GOtte not 
follow. Namely, this is the weakness and blindness of 
the flesh, as if God in truth could not give you more, who 
has also given you that because of which you stand in 
fear. The Germans use to say, and very well and 
Christianly, "GOtt still has more than He has ever 
forgiven." Therefore, if one must let his wife go for God's 
sake, let her go, let the children go, houses, friends, 
good name; God has goods enough that He can give 
back if it serves His honor, since He has also clearly 
promised (Marc. 10, 30.) that we shall receive a 
hundredfold, even in this life, if we suffer harm for His 
honor, and finally attain eternal life. But [Ps. 34, 11.], 
"The rich have need and hunger: but they that seek the 
Lord have no lack of any good," as it is written in the 
Psalm. For which of the two, thinkest thou, is better: to 
lose goods, wife, and children, yea, even life; or to lose 
the Lord, who is able to make alive, just, and holy, yea, 
who is also able to form a new heaven and a new world? 
It will certainly be better to leave the temporal goods 
than to be deprived of the eternal and of God Himself. 
But because the flesh looks only at the present things 
and at the damage of goods, as they say in Proverbs, a 
story is told to a deaf person. 


V. 3. Thus says the LORD of hosts. 


The prophets and the Scriptures everywhere call God 
"the LORD of hosts" (dominum exercituum the LORD 
of hosts) because zeba [XXX] means war service or 
army. He is therefore the HErr of the men of war or war 
service. This is certainly a wonderful

1982 L. XXVIII, 12-14. interpretations on the prophets. 


1983 





This is the title of God, which is held up to us not only for 
instruction but also for comfort. For instruction it is used 
in this way, as if to say: All those must be men of war who 
confess the name of this King or Lord. Always must they 
be in arms and in battle array, as Job also [Cap. 7, 1.] 
says, "Must not man always be at war on earth?" We 
have the bitterest and most powerful enemies, not only 
against good morals, but also against the Word, which is 
the greatest evil. The world thinks of death for us, it 
threatens that it will snatch away our life along with our 
goods. Likewise, our flesh is a very near army, the enemy 
in our own house. This weighs us down with the care for 
the nourishment of our body and those who are with us, 
it incites us to shameful deeds. Then Satan does not 
cease to attack us through evil spirits [Eph: 6, 12] with 
despair against faith, through the revelation of sin, by 
frightening the conscience and provoking it to despair in 
every way, by not ceasing to come after us and to seek 
whom he may devour, as Peter Cap. 5, 8. says in the first 
epistle. Thus it is necessary that we prove ourselves to 
be valiant warriors, since we are attacked by the most 
powerful enemies, and serve in war under God our Lord. 
Then he is called "the LORD of hosts" for our comfort, so 
that we may know that he who is in us is greater than he 
who is in the world [1 John 4:4]. For he overcame the 
world, Joh. 16, 33. since even the prince of this world has 
nothing in him [Joh. 14, 30.], but he overcame the world 
and the prince of the world; but he obtained the victory 
for us. Therefore, this is our comfort, that this our dear 
Duke faithfully assists us; he fights for us in the battle 
line. He fights for us with us, so that we do not fall into 
doubt, no matter how great our troubles may be. And this 
is the reason why the prophet Zechariah uses the word 
"the LORD of hosts" three times, as if to say: "Why are 
you afraid? What is it that grieves you? Be confident, the 
Lord fights for you, he goes before you as a leader in the 
war and fights in the battle line 2c. 





Return to me, says the LORD of hosts. 

Because this passage has been used by all sophists 
to assert free will, it must not be passed over in silence; 
but they conclude in a quite inconsistent way, so that 
anyone who does not lack the judgment of sound reason 
can also judge this inconsistency. But they conclude in 
this way: The Lord says: Turn to me and | will turn to 
you, so we have free will. | deny the inference which is 
drawn from a verb in the imperative to the indicative. For 
what kind of conclusion is this: The law says: Love God 
with all your mind, with all your strength, so | can love? 
Namely, such is our great and terrible blindness, when, 
deprived of divine grace, we once follow the light of 
nature and our reason in matters of religion. And we see 
that the most learned and excellent men of our time, on 
whom kings and princes turn their eyes, suffer from this 
blindness today. Here it is not said what | can do, but 
what | should do. For it is a word of the law, "Return ench 
to me." And so this passage serves not for our free will, 
but against free will. Thus the jurists say, and rightly, that 
by evil morals good laws are produced. For this is why 
laws are made public, because what is demanded by the 
law is not done. For if | demand something from 
someone, | immediately convince him that what | 
demand is not done by him, otherwise | would make the 
demand in a foolish way. And so also an ABC child can 
laugh at this inconsistency. Now if this had to be 
admitted to the assertors of free will, then they would 
certainly have all laws of the whole scripture for 
themselves, with all of which they could confirm the 
powers of free will. In general, there is a twofold "turning" 
here. One is our turning to God, the other is God's 
turning to us. It is something completely different when 
God turns to us than when we turn to God. But the Lord 
demands conversion from us, not as if we could do it 
with our own strength, but as if we could do it with our 
own strength. 


1984 L. xxvm, 14-16. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), cap. 


1, 3-5. 1985 





so that, having recognized our weakness, we may plead 
for the help of the Spirit, through whose action we may 
be converted. And this then is the conversion of the 
gospel. For conversion is twofold, that of the law and 
that of the gospel. The law only commands, but nothing 
is accomplished; but it is accomplished by the gospel, 
when the Spirit is added, which renews the hearts, and 
then God is converted to us. This is a conversion of 
peace, that is, that we are not only righteous, but also 
full of joy, and delight in the goodness of God. This is 
what Paul desires for Christians everywhere: "grace and 
peace." 


V. 4. Do not be like your fathers. 


He makes them aware of the past misfortune, as | 
have reminded them above, and urges them above all, 
so that he may move them, 1) not to doubt the word of 
God, which is the main purpose of all prophecies. 


Turn from your evil ways. 


The prophet speaks in the spirit, therefore he also 
judges things spiritually. For the prophets condemn, call 
godlessness and idolatry and evil ways, what seems 
good to the carnal sense, what cannot be approved 
otherwise than by the judgment of reason. Thus the 
Jews, led by their opinion and the appearance of 
goodness, instituted new services and customs to 
worship God; but because they had invented all this 
themselves, because it was invented by them, it did not 
please God, as we also said at the beginning. Therefore, 
the prophets condemned all this and testified that it was 
idolatry, not worship. So also today this carnal thought 
is very contrary to the Gospel, that it cannot be effective 
in many, since the appearance that it is right still 
deceives them; such is the hypocrisy of human statutes. 
And this is what the prophet here calls "wicked ways," 
and deals with them in such a way that they, frightened 
by the example of the fathers, would like to drop their 
presumption.

and learn to cling to the word of God alone, which is 
demanded everywhere by the whole of Scripture. But 
because the flesh cannot help but always remain the 
same, despising the word and approving of its own, 
which it has devised, 2) he adds: 


But they did not obey and did not pay attention to 
me, says the Lord. 


On obedience and heedfulness was all power, as it 
always is until the end of the world. For thus the prophets 
everywhere say: God has not commanded burnt 
offerings, but it is the word which | have commanded 
them, that they should obey my word which | speak to 
them [1 Sam. 15, 22.] 2c. But because the word of God 
has this in itself, that it commands things which are 
impossible according to the opinion of the flesh, therefore 
we leave the word and despise it, and follow our feelings 
and the things which we see laid before us, as we have 
said above in abundance. 


V.5. Where then are your fathers and the prophets? 


As if he wanted to say: Now you see that the fathers and 
the false prophets have suffered their punishment, who 
ruled safely before the captivity and considered my word 
a mockery, since | spoke to them in vain through the right 
prophets. Behold how there are none now; the kingdom 
is distraught, they themselves are carried away into 
captivity, and have perished exceedingly miserable. 
Namely, this is how | avenge the word, which is to terrify 
you, so that at least, instructed by this example of the 
fathers, you may be terrified by this wrath, seeing that 
because of the contempt of the word both the fathers and 
the prophets, both the disciples and the masters 
perished, who did not cease to oppose my word and 
wanted it to be destroyed in every way. But they perished 
while the word is still there unharmed. This is an 
excellent threat, which should rightly frighten us, so that 
the word is also close to our hearts, that we do not 
neglect it unconcernedly, as if it does not concern us, 


" 2) Because the postscript would be missing, we have deleted it

and we despise it as a cold thing. Otherwise, we too will 
suffer punishment for neglecting and despising the 
word, like them. 


Are they still alive? (Nunquid in sempiternum vivent?) 


In Hebrew the word "forever" means an indefinite 
time, which is quite clear in the day from the 21st chapter 
of the second book of Moses [v. 6.]: "He bores through 
his ear with an awl, and he shall be his servant“forever." 
In this passage it cannot mean eternity, but a certain 
length of time, that is, forever and continually he shall be 
his servant. So also here the opinion is as if to say, 
Behold how your fathers and the prophets deceived 
themselves, who spoke such things as pleased them, 
now that they are utterly destroyed. Do they still live 
unharmed? For so according to the sense that must be 
read in the indicative, what the Hebrew language says 
according to its way in the future tense. But the false 
prophets promised their listeners peace, justice, God's 
favor and security in all things, a secure kingdom and a 
quiet life. They said: Peace, peace! and yet was not 
peace [Jer. 6, 14.], as also Micah Cap. 3, 11. repeats: 
"Is not the LORD among us? There can come no evil 
upon us." To such speeches they made, the LORD 
alludes here in the prophet, as if to say: If their promises 
had been true, they would surely still be alive and 
reigning. 


V. 6. Is it not so that my words and my judgments, 
which | commanded by my servants the prophets, 
have come upon your fathers? 


Rather, this is what has happened to them: since they 
wanted to preserve themselves, but wanted my word to 
be destroyed, therefore the evil has fallen back on their 
heads, because the laws and ceremonies that | 
commanded made them guilty and plunged them into 
ruin, since they neglected them. So also today what is 
written in the Law and the Prophets testifies against the 
Jews, and judges that they are worthy of punishment 
because of the transgression. By the way, instead of 
legitima, which we can use [in 
of the Vulgate] are properly translated by the word 
ceremonies. 


1987 


That they should turn and say, As the LORD of 
hosts commanded us to do, and we went and did, so 
hath he done unto us. 


| think that this is simply said in this opinion: Now, 
struck by the law and instructed by experience, they feel 
the vengeance of the Lord, and now recognize their 
error, for the sake of which they are plagued. Now they 
have finally become ashamed. Before, when they did 
not want to leave their ways, they did not believe that 
this would happen, so surely they trusted in their cause. 
So here the prophet looks at their insolent forehead and 
their godless stubbornness, in which they were sure and 
did not even suspect that any misfortune would come 
upon them, as if to say: Now they no longer walk proudly 
and pompously, but now they feel the punishing law. 
This is how the challenge teaches to remember the word 
[Is. 28, 19]. So also we do not believe the word today, 
because we are flesh and godless; we despise the faith, 
and want to experience. But we will undoubtedly 
experience great misfortune, just as they also 
experienced, and then, when we, so afflicted by 
misfortune, would like to repent, it will be over. It is 
impossible that a great misfortune and misery will not 
await us because we neglect and despise the Word. | 
pray to God that it may not befall us also, but "God give 
His grace that we may die with grace". For just as with 
the Jews the best and holiest prophets were unable to 
accomplish anything, no matter how much they, driven 
by the Spirit of God, admonished the people against 
their godless nature, so we too must completely despair 
that we will accomplish anything, that the flesh will leave 
its ways, that is, that it will not be godless and 
unbelieving against every word of God. But it does not 
believe until it already sees, affected by the misfortune 
and surrounded, that it is lost without salvation. 
Therefore, one must command the matter to God. 

So far, we have completed the first sermon of the 
prophet, which is after the manner of the law. For he 
administers the office of the law, making consciences 
fearful. 


1988 UVIII, 18-20. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 1, 6-8. 


to humble them and bring them to self-knowledge. For 
this is the way of the Holy Spirit, that he first humbles, 
and then brings back safely those who are humbled and 
damned or cast into hell. The spirit of Satan acts quite 
differently, promising salvation with great boasts, so that 
he may make an empty pretense to the wretched and 
careless consciences. After he has thrown them into the 
error of godlessness through the hypocritical pretense, 
he cannot lead them back again 2c. Therefore, in the 
case of those who are cast down, in the case of the 
humbled and dismayed hearts, eill follows very great and 
wholly evangelical consolation. And so the prophet has 
followed the right order of the Spirit. 


V. 7. in the fourth and twentieth day of the eleventh 
moon, which is the moon Sebat, in the other year (of 
the king) Darius. 


This is the second sermon of the prophet, which he 
held long after. For the books of the prophets must be 
divided into many sermons, as | have reminded you 
several times in the case of other prophets. But, as | have 
said, he abundantly comforts the afflicted people who are 
frightened by the rebuke. He also intersperses much of 
Christ everywhere through his entire prophecy. That is 
why Christ and the apostles also cite many testimonies 
from this prophet. And that what | have said about the 
sermons of the prophets is true, that they were preached 
at different times, that they did not complete everything 
in one sermon, is already shown very clearly in this 
passage, since we see that the prophet was in hiding for 
almost three months after the first sermon. For in the 
eleventh month he began this, but the previous one in 
the eighth, so that we see that the prophets were not 
always in one fervor and heat of the Spirit, but that they 
preached sometimes this, sometimes that, at completely 
different times after the revelation of the Spirit. For such 
is the Holy Spirit, as Christ says in John (Cap. 3, 8.] says 
of the wind of the G-spirit: "He

blows where it will, and you hear its sound, but you do not 
know where it comes from or where it goes. For the 
Hebrews, March is the beginning of the year. If one counts 
the months from this in right order, the eleventh of March 
will be January, which they call Sebat (the beginning [of 
the year then follows] in a short time). 2) And so he began 
this sermon in January. 


V. 8. | saw by night, and behold, a man sitting on a 
red horse 2c. 


There is no difficulty, because we only hold on to the 
intention and the cause of the event, so that no one may 
invent difficulties in vain. This is in brief what it is about: A 
comforting face is shown to the prophet, which he is to 
interpret to the afflicted and distressed people, which all 
circumstances indicate, and thus, since the prophet had a 
certain face, the people should not doubt that they had a 
favorable GOD and a gracious father. For this is how God 
generally associates signs 3) with words, so that human 
weakness may be strengthened in the most certain way, 
to which all the words and works of God cannot appear 
otherwise than impossible. Therefore, it costs much that 
this fear be cast out and the heart become courageous, 
so that it does not doubt that God will take care of it and 
that it has a gracious God. For what is there greater than 
that the dear God is favorable to the wretched man who is 
full of sins, that God looks upon him, takes care of him 
2c.? The benefit of these things is certainly 
incomprehensible, and only those who have experienced 
them can understand them. For when the heart has taken 
on this confidence, that it believes that God will take care 
of him, that God will be favorable to him, that He will stand 
by him in all distress as the most faithful protector and 
companion, then he is no longer a man who believes this, 
but is completely of divine nature (divinus), since he has 
a divine fervor and power in his heart,

“nominative pluralis] drevi)".

By which the heart is kindled, and rises up against all 
fear, against all enemies that set themselves against 
him, in short, against all creatures. Therefore, because 
the greatness of the matter is so great, we have need of 
the word so often and abundantly, that we may finally be 
fortified 2c. Now let us look more closely at all the pieces 
of the face. 


By night. 


Night undoubtedly denotes the condition of this 
people; for as the people were constituted in heart (that 
is, what thoughts they had), so is the face. For there was 
no light among the people, that is, no gladness, no joy, 
but fear of conscience, sadness and downcast hearts, all 
of which the word "night" indicates. Therefore, to those 
who completely lacked all help, who were already in the 
midst of death, came the light and exceedingly rich 
consolation, of which, however, they did not think that it 
would happen as will follow. For at first sight, everything 
was terrible; it seemed that a greater evil threatened than 
the red horses among the myrtles that were in the 
meadow 2c. That is why the prophet is frightened when 
he sees all this. For the weakness of the human heart is 
such, so great is its fear and terror, that it flees even that 
which will bring it good and comfort, even salvation, and 
doubts in sorrow, thinking that everything will be ruinous 
for it. So here the prophet in the person of the people 
was afraid of this vision, which promised nothing but the 
highest comfort and peace. We also flee from God when 
he throws us into poverty or illness, which are certain 
signs of divine favor; immediately, | say, we despair of 
God's goodness and favor toward us, and seek salvation 
in the creatures. Thus, we cannot help but think the most 
fearful thing about any sign or word of God. Namely, this 
is what the word of the prophet means when he says: 


Vv. 9. My Lord, who are these? And the angel that 
talked with me said unto me, | will show thee who these 
are, 


| think that the angel who rides (whom the Hebrew 
language, according to its way of speaking [in the 
Vulgate], calls a man who mounts a horse; the Latins 
speak differently) is the same as the one who speaks to 
the prophet. But | do not think there is much in it if 
someone assumes different ones. Now all these riders 
agree that the land is inhabited and quiet, that is, that the 
Lord is gracious. Now no battles were to be feared, no 
kingdoms would rise against Judea 2c. That this is the 
right and true opinion that the face has, all 
circumstances will testify when they are examined and 
tested. First of all, the myrtle is a lovely and cheerful tree, 
as the pagans also invented that it was consecrated to 
Venus for this reason. For they used the myrtle to be 
merry and dance under it, just as we Germans, when we 
indicate a very lovely place, say: "under a green lime 
tree". This is known from many poems. The angel on 
horseback is there among the myrtles, that is, among the 
cheerful trees, signifying a very great cheerfulness. So 
these two spectacles, the rider and the myrtle, argue 
with each other, as if he wanted to say: You fear the 
horses, as if they foreshadowed the future war, but be 
confident, | have settled all wars, and indeed settled in 
the midst of peace. Then: 


In the floodplain. 


This is also a safe and pleasant place. For in the 
valleys are lovelier and more pleasant places than on the 
mountains, which are the abode of wild animals; as we 
say in German, "In the pretty green meadow." 

"The red, brown and white horses" denote the most 
powerful nations, as the Medes, Persians and others. 
And so he indicates that the kingdoms of all these 
nations, though they are exceedingly mighty and 
warlike, will not rage against Israel, but will be at peace, 
as if to say: These kingdoms are unharmed and mighty, 
they are not destroyed or broken; they are horses, but 
they [the kingdoms] are at peace, | have made them 
quiet. 


1992 L. XXVIII, 23-25. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 1, 9-11. 


1993 





The horsemen are undoubtedly the angels through 
whom God rules this visible world, which is clear from the 
epistle to the Hebrews [Cap. 2, 5]: "For God has not 
subjected to angels the world to come, of which we 
speak. As if he wanted to say: this visible world he has 
subjected to them, since he has made them ministering 
spirits, Hebr. 1, 14. Likewise [Ps. 91, 11.]: "He has 
commanded his angels over you, that they guard you in 
all your ways." Christ says [Matt. 18:10], "Their angels 
which are in heaven do always behold the face of my 
Father which is in heaven. "2c. But there are four kinds 
of horsemen or angels in this vision. This prophet 
delights in the number of four before other prophets, 
because the number of four will also follow several times 
afterwards. But by these four kinds he designates the 
peoples of the four regions of the world, that is, Israel will 
have peace with all the peoples of the whole world, so 
that there will be nothing at all that could cause the 
shattered Israel to despair, but since all things are at 
peace, it will be comforted and encouraged. 

Zero but with the colors of the horses we do not agree 
at all well with each other. Of the red ones (rufos) we 
know for sure which one it is, because it is the red color, 
"rothfarb". Varii, of which the moderns say that they have 
such a color, which the Latins call spadices [brown], 
which also occurs in Virgil. 1) But | am not yet sure what 
this color is, | think it is paniceum, which is reddish, like 
purple, and we call such horses "the brown white 
horses". 2) Glaucus is a bluish color, like the color of the 
sea. These we want to call "the apple-gray stallions". But 
our commentators say that these four kinds mean four 
kingdoms, that of the Persians, Chaldeans 2c. It does not 
seem to me that we should interpret it in this way, but | 
think that all the kingdoms in the four regions of the world 
or of the heavens are meant, so that this number four 
refers more to the distribution of the regions of the world, 
that is, of the morning, of the evening, of the midnight, 
and of the night.

ternight and the noon. And also this can indicate the 
colors, each of which almost coincides with an area of 
the world. 

What is left of the chapter is easy, because it is clear 
from the image or the face itself, since nothing else is 
dealt with in the whole chapter than that the face is 
explained and shown. 


V. 10. These are the ones the Lord has sent to cross 
the land. 


This is the interpretation of the face, as if he wanted 
to say: "You are very afraid, you are fainthearted, 
frightened by the savagery of the hostile nations. You do 
not support the work done in the house of the Lord, you 
fear the violence and the weapons of the neighboring 
nations, but be confident: every cause of all evil is taken 
away, because the Lord cares for you. He has sent 
angels for you to see the land, whose service the Lord 
uses in the government of all kingdoms, for they are 
ministering spirits. Namely, we are not at all abandoned 
that the rulers and superiors of the world, the angels, are 
sent out to collect customers. For this is the meaning of 
the word: "the Lord has sent them", that it indicates their 
office, namely that they will take care that nothing bad 
happens to Israel and Judah from these peoples in the 
whole world, who were the most hateful against them 
before. 


V. 11. 3) And they answered the angel of the LORD 
that kept among the myrtles. 

In Daniel Cap. 12, 1. it is prophesied that the great 
prince Michael will make himself out, who will stand for 
the people of the Lord 2c., and it is considered that this 
one is the angel among the myrtles. 


And behold, all countries sit still. 


The word "be still" (quiescendi), which is also here, 
is often used 'in Joshua and in the book of Judges [Jos. 
11, 23. Judges. 3, 11. 5, 31. 8, 28.]: "And the land 
ceased (quievit) to war," that is, all is pacified, there is 
no more wrath and cruelty of the kingdoms, there are no 
more troubles and

Wars more. Thus, the opinion here is: the whole country 
is inhabited in safety, each one enjoys his own with 
peace. 


V. 12: How long will you not have mercy on 
Jerusalem? 


Up to now the prophet has interpreted the vision, that 
itis proclaimed that everything is happy and prosperous, 
and with the message the vision agrees completely. For 
as the angels speak, so it is also in the appearance. 

Now follows a striking out and great power of 
consolation, 1) and this passage is exceedingly sweet 
and extraordinarily comforting. Now the prince Michael 
himself intercedes for the people that the Lord may have 
mercy on Jerusalem, which, as | have said, all serves to 
strengthen the afflicted people completely. It is therefore 
as if he wanted to say: Lord, your people alone is 
miserable and fearful, alone laden with misfortune 
before all the other peoples in the whole world, while it 
is fitting for this one to be in the highest confidence and 
in glory. But nowhere is the land less cultivated than in 
your land, nowhere is there less peace than in the 
people of peace, while in the meantime the other 
peoples are secure and in prosperity. So vehement is 
the prayer by the quarreling [with God, which is based 
on the divine promise, as if he wanted to say: If you do 
good to the heathen, why do you not rather do good to 
your own, to whom you promised that you would help 
them, of whom you said that you would preserve them 
against the attacks of all nations on earth 2c. ? 


Over whom you have been angry these seventy 
years. 


He answers himself by an objection, as if he heard 
the Lord reply that it is not yet time to help Jerusalem, 
and says: Now is the time for the people to be made 
glorious again according to the promise of the seventieth 
year. But this prophecy is found in Jeremiah Cap. 29:10: 
"When seventy years are ended at Babylon, | will visit 
you, and will give you my gracious word. 


1) Instead of kxpositionis in our original, we have assumed 
eonsolationis according to the Zwickau manuscript. 





Raise above you" 2c. By this promise they were 
preserved, as many of them were preserved in the 
captivity, otherwise none would have been saved, since 
the captivity opposed the promise of the eternal kingdom 
of David. For what seemed less true than that the throne 
of David would be eternal after both the king and the 
people were taken away? Therefore the Lord added 
another promise, so that they would not doubt that even 
though they were captives, they would return to their 
land and be glorious. 


V. 13. Kind words and comforting words. 


Not for the sake of the prophet, but for the sake of the 
people, but it is revealed to the prophet, so that he may 
announce it to the people, so that he may strengthen the 
broken hearts and make them firm, as if to say: Do not 
be afraid, but rather be confident and rejoice; the Lord 
speaks comforting and sweet things. 


V. 14. Preach and speak (clama). 


The prophet is commanded to announce these 
exceedingly rich consolations to the people. The word 
clamare, as it is taken here, must actually be translated 
by the word "preach," so that the office is indicated; for 
this word is also frequent in Moses. But he prescribes to 
the prophet what he should preach: 


| have been very jealous about Jerusalem and Zion. 


This is a very beautiful passage, as | have said, and 
contains such great comfort as nothing before. All the 
words are spoken very appropriately: the zeal he 
assigns to his people, the anger to the Gentiles. But the 
zeal is actually a wrath, which includes love by nature, 
as aman has a zeal over his wife. In short, it is a hatred 
of evil against the beloved object, "a kind, loving hatred 
or wrath," as the wrath of parents is against children who 
err. Therefore, by this single word, the Lord removes all 
suspicion of anger, as if to say, "My zeal against 
Jerusalem has been great, but now that a 


1996 s. xxvin, 27-29. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 


When the end is made, the wrath is overcome by love; it 
has not been both a wrath and a zeal. The dear God 
loved this people for the sake of His Christ, who was to 
be born from the flesh of this people. Therefore, he bore 
the vices of this people with displeasure, as a man 
cannot bear the love of others for his wife, and again the 
woman against the man. 


V. 15, But! am very angry with the proud Gentiles. 


That is, | have been jealous over Jerusalem, all to her 
credit, because | have loved her. But against the Gentiles 
| am angry, and with a great wrath; | will destroy them all 
from the foundation of the world, because they are rich. 
Namely, this he hates in the Gentiles, that they are much, 
great and rich, that is, that they trust in their strength and 
power; trusting in these they despised God and God's 
people. So the pride and the hope or the trust in 
themselves he hates in the Gentiles. 


Because | was just a little angry. 


He explains what the zeal is, and it is the opinion: | did 
not want my people to be ruined and abandoned; | only 
chastised them for their good; | wanted to heal them, not 
kill them. Thus he certainly comforts the afflicted hearts, 
and certainly with the kindest words. For what could be 
more sweet and pleasant than to know that God 
chastises no differently than a father; when the heart 
feels this, there is much more sweetness in the 
knowledge of the Father's will than pain over the 
chastisement, since this feeling in the heart that He is 
our Father alleviates all pain that is certainly felt when 
we are chastised. Therefore, this word can also serve as 
a consolation in every adversity, when God pushes us 
into poverty, into shame, into the cross; when He lets us 
snatch away what is ours, we should always Say in this 
way: "Let go, God does not mean it badly," He does 
everything out of a fatherly attitude, it is a fatherly zeal; 
He cannot always be angry. When this happens, "it is 
more than half done". 





I, 14-16. 1997 


But they help to perish. 


This saying is also wonderful, and no less comforting 
than the previous one. And it is the opinion: The heathen 
give help to each other; they conspire against my people, 
that they would destroy them completely, so that not 
even the name would remain, as the [137th] Psalm 
repeats the words of the heathen [v. 7.]: "Clean off, clean 
off, down to their ground." And this conspiracy of the 
heathen he calls, "help to destruction." This word, as | 
have said, is exceedingly lovely, since the Lord indicates 
that not only is he not angry with us when he chastises 
us, but that he hates the rod with which he chastises us. 
Therefore this passage is worthy of attention, which can 
also serve us for comfort, if we are chastised by our 
adversaries according to the will of the Lord for a good 
and godly thing, that we should know that it is a fatherly 
rod, that nothing evil threatens us; then that the Lord also 
hates the adversaries. When we know this, we are 
enlivened by the joyful spirit that we can gladly suffer the 
hand of the Lord, bring vengeance home to the Lord, and 
despise the enemies, no matter how much they rage and 
rage. 


V. 16. 1) | will turn again to Jerusalem with mercy. 


For now | have mercy, | promise mercy; | will chasten 
no more, because | cease to be angry. This is certainly 
an exceedingly rich promise; if it falls into a man's heart 
and bears fruit, he is a master of death, sin, and hell; so 
nothing at all can be to terrify such a man. And who, 
trusting in such exceedingly rich divine promises, should 
not dare to build a castle that reaches to the clouds? 


For this purpose, the room cord is to be drawn in 
Jerusalem. 


He uses a paraphrase by which he indicates that the 
city itself is to be rebuilt, not just the temple.

pel, as if he wanted to say: So great will be the peace 
and security that the craftsmen can safely and, as it 
were, sleepily continue to build the city, that they will not 
hurry from fear and be forced to interrupt the work 
undertaken, as before. 


V. 17: My cities shall prosper again. 

That is, not only Jerusalem, but also the land of Judah 
and all the other cities of my country shall be in 
prosperity. Here is a very fitting word in Hebrew, which 
we cannot well render by a Latin word. But it can be 
translated literally according to the Hebrew like this: nor 
shall my cities be scattered with goods, that is, there 
shall be various cities scattered here and there, and 
each one shall not lack its goods. He does not intend the 
abundance of goods, but the distribution. 

No doubt the prophet spent many sermons on these 
exceedingly rich promises (after all, he could hardly 
explain the strength and greatness of these promises 
through many sermons). So they could certainly also 
give us a quite extensive and rich content for many 
sermons, so exceedingly lovely and full of consolation is 
everything. When the prophet examined this in relation 
to all circumstances, when he applied it to the individual 
cities according to the magnitude of the calamity, he had 
many sermons to preach, just as everything is worthy of 
very ample treatment. For what could be more 
comforting to the wretched and afflicted consciences 
than to hear that Jerusalem was to be rebuilt, the cities 
restored to their former dignity, the people made glorious 
by the Lord? All the Gentiles thought that this people had 
been destroyed; they thought that it had perished. And 
since the city of Jerusalem had been destroyed to the 
utmost, they finally heard that the Lord had chosen 
Jerusalem again, that he was favorable to her and 
wanted her to prosper. 


V. 18. And behold, there were four horns. 
This is another face that confirms the comfort of the 
previous one. But what I have remembered above from 
the number four is 





also here also to note. "Horns" everywhere in Scripture, 
even nack) the historical view, mean kingdoms. This is 
especially evident from Daniel. Therefore the four horns 
mean the kingdoms, which are distributed after the four 
world gegeuden. 


V. 19-21. 1) These are the horns that scattered 


Judah together with Israel and Jerusalem 2c. 

Here [in v. 21] he does not interpret the forge, as it 
might seem according to our unrhymed translation, but 
according to the Hebrew way he "construed" it. For the 
Hebrew language is wont to put the relative first and the 
demonstrative after it, as is evident from the first Psalm 
[v. 4]: Like chaff, which the wind scatters. Likewise in 
another Psalm [Ps. 68, 17.j: The mountain on which God 
desires to dwell on it. Since our interpreter has not taken 
this into account, he has confused the order of the 
construction. But according to the Hebrew [v. 21] it is 
correctly read this way: He said, These horns which 
scattered Judah man by man, and none of them lifted up 
his head: to deter the same these came 2c. But a Latin 
would construe thus: These are come to deter all that 
Judah hath scattered 2c. But the opinion is: These are 
come, that they put to flight, that they frighten and drive 
away from my people all kingdoms of the whole world 
violence and tyranny, which they threaten. But there is 
an apt word here, which our interpreter has translated by 
the verbum deterrere ["to deter"]. Moses also used the 
same word in the first book, Cap. 35, 5: "And the fear of 
GOD came upon all the cities that were round about 
them." 

The Lord sends his word in such abundance, when 
he has mercy on us, that there is no measure; he pours 
himself out so completely, and his goodness and 
kindness have no end. But when he is angry, there is no 
measure of wrath; for when he takes away his word, 
wrath always follows wrath, so great is the calamity.

and the frightening blindness. But when he promises 
that he will be a father, he gives himself completely, 
there is nothing of bitterness, no terror, everything is well 
and pacified. So we see here how great and how various 
consolations, how great vehemence her very good and 
gracious father used to revive and strengthen the 
trembling and bruised hearts, so that they should fear 
nothing more, but believe that they would have a 
gracious father. So highly does GOtte deserve that he 
strengthens and comforts a fearful and frightened 
conscience, so that man finally returns to him. For such 
a fear of conscience is beyond measure frightening and 
great, for conscience is such a tender, weak and 
incapable thing that, once it is frightened, it can hardly 
be set right again with great care, with the greatest 
consolations of the divine word, lest it continue to 
despair more and more from day to day. This is not 
known to those who in our times write much about the 
organization of human life. If 


If they had learned even once how great the anxiety and 
horror of a troubled conscience would be, how terrifying 
the fear, they would easily desist and not press so hard 
for life. The dear Lord knows his own body, he knows 
our weakness, therefore he sees that we are in need of 
so many lovely promises and consolations. "Oh Lord 
God, it is a much greater thing that such a conscience 
should be raised than those who believe 2c. 

And this is the historical meaning of the first chapter, 
that the fearful hearts should be encouraged and 
strengthened, so that they will not let themselves be 
deterred by any force to continue building the house of 
the Lord that they have started. There is nothing so 
difficult, nothing so cruel, that they should fear it; the 
Lord will stand by them, he will not allow the heathen to 
rage against his people according to their liking and to 
destroy them miserably (he calls this "scattering man by 
man"), nor will he allow them to lift up their horns, that 
is, to "go through with their heads". 


The second chapter. 


In this second chapter, the prophet himself does 
what a preacher is wont to do, and turns history into a 
prophecy with a spiritual interpretation (prophetiam 
allegoricam). For as he said above of the present state 
of Jerusalem, so he will say here of the future, that 
everything in the spirit signifies the future grace through 
Christ, which is to be revealed in the whole world. And 
here it will be revealed why he was so pleased with the 
fourfold number. 

By all this, what he has said above about the highest 
peace and the outward rest, about the rebuilding of 
Jerusalem 2c., he indicates that everything happens 
because of the future grace, which is to be revealed 
through Christ. Therefore he adds here in this chapter 
the spiritual kingdom of Christ. 





and declares even the horses and the horns that scatter, 
and makes all things spiritual, and now comes, as | have 
said, the cause why he used the number four. For the 
gospel was to be spread and propagated to the ends of 
the earth, to all nations, as is evident from the Psalm [Ps. 
72, 8.], "He shall reign from sea to sea" 2c. And Christ 
says [Matth. 24, 31]: "They will gather His elect from the 
four winds" 2c. Likewise Isa. 60, 4. "Thy sons shall come 
from afar, and thy daughters shall be brought up by the 
way." In these and all similar passages the spiritual 
interpretation is hidden in the words of comforting, ruling, 
just as here also the enlargement of Jerusalem is to be 
understood spiritually, for this cannot fit upon 


2002 L. XXVIII, 33-3S. Interpretations on the Prophets. 


2003 





the fleshly Jerusalem, as we shall see in order. The 
spiritual interpretation of the second and the first chapter 
is this: 

The angels with the horses are the kingdoms of the 
whole world. They are under the myrtles, that is, they are 
in peace and quiet. The physical peace was necessary 
in the people of Judah, so that the city of Jerusalem and 
other cities could be rebuilt. This was the meaning of 
history, but the spiritual interpretation is this: By this 
outward peace is signified the spiritual happiness and 
security of the church, that is, of the godly who believe in 
Christ. Their consciences are pacified and secure, so 
that there is nothing that could tear them away from the 
love of God, no matter how much external struggles and 
hatred there may be. For as Christ says [John 16:33], "In 
the world ye fear; in me ye shall have peace." For the 
world does not cease from raging and persecuting the 
members of Christ, "the lords counseling with one 
another against the Lord and his anointed," as it is said 
in the second Psalm [v. 2]. And yet in all this the 
Christians are not defeated; so great is the peace of 
Christ, which is higher than all understanding, as Paul 
says [Phil. 4:7], that is, it is a peace of heart, that in all 
tribulations so much is lacking in it, that we are overcome 
by terror, that we even boast, as Paul says Rom. 5:3. 
Nevertheless, the Lord, not by taking away the evils and 
the enemies, but by sending us into them, makes us sure 
that we will always be joyful, that we will not be overcome 
by any misfortune, no matter how much the whole world 
gnashes its teeth against us. The pope may rage, the 
emperor and his princes may threaten us with evil, yet 
we will sit in beautiful peace, even though they throw us 
into prison if they are allowed to indulge their anger. If 
they finally kill us, we will rejoice no less than if we were 
invited to a wedding, which is also what St. Agnes 
answered the tyrant by whom she was to be killed 2c. 
The blacksmiths are the preachers of the Gospel as well 
as the angels who ride; because they are ministers of the 
Word, they do not fight with violence but with the Word. 
This is according to the appearance a ge 





ringer fight and exceedingly weak weapons, but 
nevertheless, by this very word, which seems to the 
world to be a ridiculous fUndlein, they direct that they 
make the highest and mightiest kingdoms flee from us, 
and we let our enemies rather lament than fear them. 
And we suffer that they so uselessly waste their anger 
and displeasure by setting themselves against us with 
damage to Gnt, body and soul, but in vain, because we 
always have the horses among the myrtles. Namely, this 
is how our enemies must succumb to us, since they can 
overcome nothing less in us than the courage that 
always stands firm and undaunted like a brazen wall, and 
despises both their threats and their violence. This is 
what most vexes Satan, who, when he attacks our 
bodies, intends to overcome the soul; otherwise he 
considers it nothing that the body is injured. And all this 
the prophet teaches in this second chapter, which | call 
the spiritual interpretation of the previous one. For it 
cannot be the fleshly Jerusalem' which the prophet sees 
here, as the context itself proves. 


V. i. And behold, a man had a measuring cord in his 
hand. 


This man is Christ, who has received the gift of the 
Holy Spirit from the Father, who measures his church in 
the most certain way, that is, by the very certain gifts of 
the Spirit he makes either small or great, for he gives to 
each one as much as he wills, as also the apostle says 
in the Epistle to the Ephesians [Cap. 4, 7.]: "According to 
the measure of the gift of Christ." Thus the Church 
extends no further than the Spirit of Christ, see 1 Cor. 
12, 1. ff. And this is what the measuring cord indicates, 
namely the Holy Spirit with His gifts. 


V. 3. 1) And another angel came out to meet him, 
and said to him. 


| pass over what Jerome dreams in this passage: that 
the angels did not know the mystery of the Incarnation, 
and what Dionysius dreams of the celestial order 
(hierarchia): that some angels

2005 





to be taught by others that some are the lowest, others 
the highest, and, | don't know what else, which he writes 
so impudently as if he had witnessed it himself. Christ 
says [Matth. 18, 10.]: "The angels see the face of the 
Father." Therefore, it is God who enlightens the angels, 
who uses their service; therefore, they are not 
enlightened by each other. But because all this happens 
for the comfort of the afflicted and frightened people, this 
play had to be performed. 


V. 4. Run and tell this boy. 


That is, say to Zechariah. 


Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls. 


In Nehemiah and Ezra, the command was given to 
rebuild Jerusalem, as well as the walls around the city. 
Therefore it is clear that this passage cannot be 
understood of the fleshly Jerusalem, but of the 
Jerusalem whose border is the end of the world. As if he 
wanted to say: No city will be able to be so wide and 
large that it could contain the Christians. So great will be 
their multitude, since they dwell in the whole world. | do 
not dislike the opinion of those who lay out men from the 
strong in faith, but cattle from the weak. For Christ's body 
has flesh and bones, that is. Strong and weak. But 
because it is a kingdom of love, therefore one bears the 
infirmity of another with patience, as Paul says [Rom. 
15:11. 


V. 5. | will be a fiery wall around. 


This spiritual Jerusalem will be without a physical wall, 
but instead of the stone wall it will have a fiery wall, which 
the Lord himself will be, as he promises. This is an 
exceedingly rich consolation, but since it is such an 
exceedingly rich consolation as nothing before, no one 
believes it, unless he is enlightened by the Spirit in his 
heart. Here we have such eyes of need as Elisha had [2 
Kings 6:16 f.], when he saw fiery chariots and horses 
round about, and said to the servant, "There are more of 
them that are with us than of them that are with them." It 
is an exceedingly 





clear passage in the Psalm [Ps. 125, 2.]: "Around 
Jerusalem are mountains, and the LORD is around his 
people", if only we believed it; God does not lie. He is a 
fiery wall for His faithful, that is, a terrible wall, since it 
makes all adversaries utterly nothing. For what power, 
what might could be so great that it could stand against 
this wall, which is voracious and consumes everything 
on which it falls! Here Satan and all the enemies of the 
Word must give way. For who can overcome the Lord, 
the divine majesty, who scatters all the adversaries of his 
1) church and makes them nothing but dust. But this is 
spoken in the spirit, in the spirit it is also understood. For 
this faith is necessary, for the flesh has before it the 
contradiction, when we are attacked by the enemies, 
when they take us captive and rage against us according 
to their will, and finally also kill us. But the Lord says that 
he is a fiery wall, as if to say: Be of good cheer, however 
much they may rage against you, they will not overcome 
me, they will not escape my vengeance, for in a short 
time it will happen that they are nothing, that hardly their 
name is left, but they will be destroyed and annihilated 
from the bottom up. He has shown this very well in the 
terrible condemnation of the Jews, since they are 
scattered all over the world and hardly some remnants 
are left, and they are very miserable. He showed the 
same 2) in the destruction of the Roman Empire, which 
was certainly the most powerful and prosperous, and for 
a time raged against the holy martyrs of Christ. At last 
this fiery wall has so scattered and devastated it that now 
the city [Rome] itself does not have the appearance of a 
city, so great is the accumulation of impurity and so great 
the disorder; so much is lacking in it that one could even 
see the image of so exceedingly brilliant an empire 3). 
Now | would like to have reminded our princes, who 
nowadays try to do evil to nns, who race against us as if 
they wanted to flay nns alive: but they might race, they

They may let their impotent authority and rage loose, in 
a short time afterwards it will happen that they are 
nothing, that people hardly remember their name 
anymore, may it be the Margrave or the Duke George. 
God has not spared the despisers of his word from the 
beginning, so he will not spare them now. He will be a 
fiery wall for them; if they run against it, they will be 
ashes and nothing 2c. 


And | want to be inside, and | want to be glorious 
inside. 

He takes away all the glory of the flesh, so that 
whoever boasts may boast in the Lord, so that we may 
boast in our Lord Christ alone. The fleshly Jerusalem 
prospered in glory, in people, in arms, in valor, in 
prosperity, in righteousness, in the law. Of all these 
things she boasted. But the only glory of the Christians 
is in Christ, in whom they believe and trust. 


V. 6. Hui! flee from the land of midnight. 


After the prophet has presented the promise and the 
consolation, he adds an exhortation so that the Jews 
would not despise the so great grace, the unspeakable 
mercy of God. The prophet saw that this would happen, 
namely that almost all of Israel would despise Christ and 
the grace promised in Christ; therefore it should be 
rejected so that hardly any remnants would remain. And 
this one thing is most grievous to all good evangelists, 
that they see that the world not only despises the gospel 
of the glory of the great God, but also persecutes it, 
which may serve as proof that the world is not only 
foolish and ignorant of God, but that it is full of devils, by 
which it is driven 2c. This passage torments Lyra, rather 
he torments himself, why the LORD calls his people 
back only from midnight, since they were scattered over 
the whole earth, to all four winds. | leave all secret 
interpretations and hold for the fact that this is the one 





It is a common opinion that the return from Babylon 
happened only recently. Of course, also under this 
captivity and under the Assyrian captivity the children of 
Israel were scattered all over the world, as | also said 
above. For they were so scattered by the king of the 
Chaldeans and the Assyrians, and some of them sought 
salvation for themselves by flight. Therefore the greater 
part of the captives was in Babylon. That is why he called 
them back from Babylon alone, because there were the 
greater multitude and those who had been led away. As 
if he wanted to say: Great things are at the door. Soon 
Christ will come, your King and Savior. Do not stay with 
the Babylonians. If you do not come to the physical 
Jerusalem, come to the spiritual one. For this was 
promised, that the law should go forth out of Zion, and 
the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem. 


V. 8. He sent me after the glory to the Gentiles. 


This is a confirmation and magnification of the promise of 
the new and wonderfully great Jerusalem, which is to be 
built in the whole world. But it describes the master and 
the duke or the head of this new Jerusalem, since this 
cannot be understood of the earthly Jerusalem, since it 
is certain that they never subdued the Assyrians, 
Chaldeans and Egyptians. Therefore it must be 
understood by a spiritual submission. But it is God, the 
LORD of hosts, who speaks here, not Zechariah, who 
was sent only to the Jews as a prophet to strengthen 
them, not to the Chaldeans and Assyrians. Therefore, the 
grammatical sense also proves here that Christ is true 
God and man, because the true LORD of hosts sends the 
true LORD of hosts. But he is sent to the Gentiles, not in 
his own person, but through his gospel and through his 
Spirit, as it says in the letter to the Ephesians [Eph. 2, 
17.]. But he comes "after glory," as he says here; at this 
point our commentators agonize extraordinarily. But | 
think that it should simply be understood that Christ says 
that he will come "after the glory," that is, after the 
synagogue and the church have been rebuilt. 


2008 L. XXVIII, 40-42. interpretation of Zechariah'(2.), Cap. 2, 8. 


the kingdom has been restored and brought back from 
Babylon, as if to say: | have promised that both the 
priesthood and the kingdom of this people shall be 
restored, that the Jewish cities shall be rebuilt, that the 
people shall enjoy theirs in peace 2c. When this will 
have happened, and they will gradually falter again, | will 
be there immediately, not in honor, but "after honor", in 
lowliness and contempt. Therefore, you will expect me 
in vain as one who is glorious with royal splendor and 
splendor; only do not deceive yourselves if you desire 
arms and desire power and royal splendor in me. 

It agrees with this opinion of ours also Isaiah, since 
he says [Cap. 11, Il: "There shall come up a rod from the 
root (or trunk) of Jesse, and a branch upon his root shall 
bring forth fruit." For Christ came into the flesh at the 
time when the tribe of David lay down quite unheeded 
and had almost ceased. There was no longer a king 
sitting on the throne of David, who was born from his 
loins, but now the chief priests and the priests had 
followed, who fought against the tribe of Judah for 
supremacy, which is evident from the history of the 
Maccabees and from Philo. But the priests were 
victorious, so that there was no hope for the tribe of 
Judah to regain the royal dignity, because the godless 
Gentiles prevailed. So Christ came, when the affairs of 
the tribe of Judah stood distressed and sorrowful, to take 
the kingdom again upon Himself, as had been promised. 
And this is what Isaiah calls a rod coming up and bearing 
fruit from a dead tribe. Here also belonged the prophecy 
of Jacob [Gen. 49, 10.]: "The scepter shall not be taken 
from Judah, nor a master from his feet, until the coming 
of the hero" 2c., that is, Christ would come when the 
supremacy and the royal dignity ceased to be in the tribe 
of Judah. And to this disgrace and lowly nature of the 
tribe of Judah he looks here, since he says he will come 
"after the glory," that is, since the people were again 
abased, and chiefly the royal tribe of Judah 2c. 





2009 


He who touches you touches his eyeball. 

|, he says, am sent to the Gentiles, as it were to 
avenge you, because they have robbed you, they have 
subdued you. | null subdue them again, but this will be a 
wonderful subjugation, namely in that they will plague 
you, make an attack on you. But nevertheless, however 
much they afflict you, however much they injure you, they 
will afflict me, injure me; for this he calls "afflicting," as it 
is also in the Psalm [Ps. 105:15.], "Touch not mine 
anointed." It is therefore quite spiritual to understand this 
passage, as if he meant to say, Put out of sight all 
ostentation, all shining and royal splendor. For you will 
be kings, but strange ones, for you will be touched, that 
is, you will be afflicted, you will be forced to carry the 
cross, the Gentiles will threaten you with adversities 2c., 
but nevertheless you will be subject to all this and thus 
be equal to great adversity; but the Gentiles, who 
confidently believe that they are victors, will succumb. 
Thus there is a marvelous contrast, which goes entirely 
against all judgment of reason, that he who is defeated 
overcomes; he who is defeated is defeated. For when 
Christians are defeated according to the judgment of the 
world, weighed down by adversities, they are victorious 
by the power of the Spirit of God. Here again we see an 
exceedingly rich promise; if we had our hearts fortified by 
the same, what adversity, what power of the world or of 
Satan could be so great that we would be overcome by 
it? We would not only be equal to it, but far superior, since 
the Lord esteems us so great, cares for us so 
exceedingly, and loves us so much, that he says the 
apple of his eye is touched when we are touched, that is, 
when we are afflicted and distressed. There is nothing 
more delicate than the apple of the eye, therefore the 
Lord says that he who touches the Christians touches the 
apple of his eye. It is therefore the summa of the saying: 
| love and keep you no less than my eyes. But this 
demands faith; it will not and cannot be grasped by 
reason. For reason is the opposite of general. Since he 
says that he cares for us as much as he cares for you. 


2010 L. XXVIH, 42-44. interpretations on the prophets. 


2011 





he carries for the apple of his eye, meanwhile he throws 
us into prison, lets us be chased away with loss of our 
goods, children, yes, even lets us be killed. 1) Thus he 
let his very dear friend, John the Baptist, perish by an 
exceedingly shameful and quite disgraceful death, that 
the head of the most holy man was given as a reward for 
the shameless gestures of an insolent whore. This is, 
according to the judgment of reason, an excellent care 
of God for His saints, that is, of course, to love as the 
apple of His eye. But, as | said, faith believes this and 
feels it when man is in tribulation, when he learns this 
new way of war and the new way of victory, namely 
through the cross. And if we believed this, we would 
never cease to weep for the miserable blindness and 
godlessness of our enemies when they persecute us, 
knowing that they are touching the apple of the Lord's 
eye, which is an appalling sin, "nor will GOD give it to 
them" 2c. 


V. 9 For behold, | will weave my hand over them. 

That is, | am mighty, | will exercise my power against 
those who have robbed you, namely, | will defeat them 
through your weakness. For in this way, through that 
which is weak in the sight of the world, he also conquers 
that which is strongest, by setting the wretched little 
worm, the weak little man, a thinner vessel, against the 
brazen mountains, against the exceedingly strong and 
mighty spirit, Satan, who is bent on it with all his strength 
and pursues one thing, that he may break this weak 
vessel and make it nothing. And Satan would 
accomplish what he wants without any effort, if God did 
not cover himself in our weakness and thus overcome 
Satan through us, against whose power and rage we are 
otherwise nothing but dust and very light ashes. This is 
what happened in the beginning, when the church came 
into being; the number of believers grew through much 
death and wounds, and no violence and tyranny could 
be so great as to deter the Christians; rather, they 
became more and more courageous and their number 
increased.

just as the heads of Hercules were reborn from the

That ye may know that the LORD of hosts hath sent

That is, when you will be in tribulation, when you will 
be attacked by enemies, then, taught by experience 
itself, you will realize and understand that | am arranging 
all this. 


V. 10. Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Zion. 

This is a congratulation for the knowledge and 
possession of such a great glory under the cross and 
ignominy. For this joy, so loud, is incredible when we feel 
that through our weakness we overcome the immense 
power of Satan. Here is nothing of tribulations, nothing 
of adversities that could take away this joy from the 
hearts. 


For behold, | come, and will dwell with thee. 

God dwells with us, that is, in our hearts, through 
faith, as it says in the letter to the Ephesians, and John 
says [1 Ep. 4, 4]: He who is in us is greater than he who 
is in the world. Therefore, to have God dwell in us is to 
have a heart full of trust in Christ, who will have mercy 
on us, to be a kind father, and to protect us in all 
adversity. 


V. 11: And in that day many nations shall be 
brought unto the Lord. 

It is the same as what he said above about making 
Jerusalem great over the whole earth, namely, that 
through the word and faith the Gentiles should be 
converted, that they should believe in Christ, that they 
should be implanted, and become inhabitants of this 
Jerusalem. But here is an excellent passage about the 
conversion of the Gentiles to the Gospel. 


V. 12: And the Lord shall inherit Judah for his 
portion in the holy land. 

He explicitly distinguishes one country from the other, 
as if to say: The Lord will no longer abandon Judah, but 
will inherit it and will take it again as his own property and 
his portion, and this will be 


2012 XXVIII, 44-46. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 


happen in the holy land, that is, which is not polluted, nor 
can be defiled and desecrated, as Isaiah says: The 
ungodly people shall no more pass through you. This 
cannot at all be understood of the land of Judah, in which 
many ungodly dwelt, but he speaks of the true church, 
which is sanctified by the Spirit of Christ, for "whom the 
Spirit of GOD impels, they are the children of GOD" 
[Rom. 8:14.], as the apostle says. 


V. 13. Let all flesh be still before the Lord. 


This is an address to all nations, as if he wanted to 
say: Because such a kingdom in the whole 





2, 12. 13. 2013 


world will come, such a great sanctification, therefore be 
still, you nations, the kingdom of Christ is coming. For it 
is coming and running, for the word is sent and preached 
among all nations. "Be still," that is, soften, give place, 
cease from your presumption and presumption, let him 
reign. 


For he has set out from his holy place. 


That is, he brought forth the gospel, and now began 
to rule through his gospel. 


The third chapter. 


In the previous chapters we have seen that the prophet 
dealt with it, that he encouraged and strengthened the 
people, so that they should continue to promote and 
finish building the house of the Lord. Here, in the 
following, he strengthens the leaders of the people, who 
preside over the people in both spiritual and civil matters. 
The chief in spiritual matters was Joshua the priest, in 
temporal matters Zerubbabel. He encourages both of 
them by very great and sweet consolations and 
promises, since it is very important to have a courageous 
leader among the people, by whose example the rest of 
the crowd, not frightened by any difficulty, easily follows 
the leader, as it is commonly said: "A good leader is 
worthy of all honor. 

But this passage concerning life (moralis) is to be 
especially noted, how exceedingly difficult it is to follow 
the divine calling, how great an effort, how great a 
consolation is necessary that we finally renounce our 
thoughts and inclinations and render obedience to the 
divine calling. For behold, how the people trembled 
above, how the prophet, by such exceedingly rich and 
sweet consolations, accomplished almost nothing; 
behold, how here with the priest, and afterwards with the 
leader, nothing is 





but trembling and utter despair, so that they could hardly, 
encouraged by the great promises, be brought to 
accomplish the work of the Lord which they had begun. 
And such is the nature of the divine calling that it first 
attacks the matter with great fear, trembling and despair. 
Nothing is done in haste here, nothing is done 
sacrilegiously, nothing is done with a certain audacity or 
impudence, but many consolations are needed. 
Therefore, this passage is to be heeded very carefully, 
so that we too may approach the work of our calling with 
fear and trembling, otherwise it will come to nothing if, 
trusting in our counsel and with impudence, we 
undertake something more brazenly than is right. And 
there cannot be the right spirit in those who, as it were, 
rejoicingly triumph immediately in the beginning of their 
vocation and undertake everything, immediately 
ascertain everything in the most certain way, as if they 
had already conquered Satan, while they have not yet 
seen him. When they have to give an account of their 
intentions in the face of adversity, it is surprising how 
much they mistrust their cause, how they cannot stand. 
We have seen this in our prophets. The prophet Isaiah 
was completely opposed to the Lord's sending him; he 
denounced the uncleanliness of the 


2014 L. XXVIIL, 46-48. interpretations on the prophets. 


2015 





Moses and Jeremiah prevented their lack of eloquence 
so that they would not be sent. For all the works of God 
go beyond all thoughts, powers and understanding of 
reason; He demands and wants to be done far higher 
and more difficult things than human understanding 
could achieve, yes, it seems to be completely impossible 
1). That is why we need another master, so that we can 
break through, i.e. that we hang on the word alone with 
closed eyes and ears, give God the glory that he is true, 
and do not doubt that he will accomplish what he wanted 
to accomplish through us. This is what Paul says [Eph. 
3:20]: "God is able to do exceedingly abundantly above 
all that we understand." 

We see the same thing here, how impossible the 
matter seemed to the priest, how many things deterred 
him. First of all, his conscience was troubled and not well 
fortified; he was confronted with the common question: 
Who knows whether God is pleased with a sinful man? 
A guilty conscience cannot do anything good; it always 
approaches the matter with trembling, yes, with the 
greatest uncertainty, since it is uncertain about God's 
will. Therefore, the work cannot please God if the heart 
is so wavering. A good work must be done with a 
completely good conscience, for we must believe that it 
is not our work, that it is not in our power or in our 
counsel, but that it is God's work. Therefore, we must 
trust with a sure and unshakable conscience that the 
Lord will accomplish what He has undertaken through us 
and through our service, that we will recognize that we 
are God's instrument. Otherwise, if the heart is not so 
fortified, it is impossible that we should not draw back. 
For we are immediately frightened by the greatness of 
the work, by the exceeding difficulty of carrying it out, by 
reason, by Satan, who makes the work so exceedingly 
great that he may turn us away, so that he may make us 
turn back by showing us the difficulty and the many 
impending evils. Likewise, by making our sin and the 
weakness of the flesh, he makes us turn back. 


1) Instead of iLdeeitlia we have assumed imposgidita. 





The first thing that is revealed and magnified is that God 
is not pleased with sinners, but rejects and punishes 
them; it requires holy people to be ordained for such 
divine works. 2c. This is certainly a very fierce battle, for 
if we stand up to this challenge, we overcome sin, death 
and the devil at the same time, in that the heart does not 
tremble, does not doubt the will of God, that God is 
pleased with him, even though there is weakness and 
sin; God wants to use his service, no matter how 
different it appears to the flesh. Certainly it is not in 
human power to overcome these three things, therefore 
it is necessary that the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, assist 
us, making our hearts brave, that we may break through 
cheerfully, letting God use our service, unafraid of the 
fear of death or sin. Or if we are not completely cheerful 
and bold, we should still break through in the midst of 
weakness and trepidation, having our eyes always fixed, 
not on our weakness, but on the will of God, who has 
placed us in such a calling according to His will 2c. The 
same can be seen beautifully in this chapter. For the 
prophet has entirely to do with strengthening the priest, 
who is so apprehensive and frightened by the greatness 
of the matter, by the threatening evils, even by his sin, 
and to make him courageous against all these attempts 
2c. 


V. 1 And Joshua the high priest was shown to me. 


It was not the person of Joshua the high priest that 
the prophet saw, but a kind of image through which 
Joshua the high priest was indicated. 


And Satan stood at his right hand. 


"Satan" generally and actually means any adversary. 
| like that it means here -specifically the devil. And here 
again it must be understood that he saw a kind of image 
of a man who always resisted the priest and deterred 
him, he might perform what he wanted. 

It is quite an extraordinarily beautiful face, because in 
an exceedingly appropriate way it shows 


2016 L. XXVIII, 48-50. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 3, 1-3. 


2017 





The priest's heart and the innermost movements of his 
heart are completely revealed to us. For he had heard 
God's clear command that the temple be rebuilt. Now 
that he had heard the word, he thought that God must 
be obeyed, and yet he struggled so with himself: Who 
knows if GOt will approve; Perhaps he will reject us 
sinners. And so the human heart struggles with sin 
before God in general, for the devil inflates sins and 
makes them great in such a way that it seems to the 
heart that God will reject it, and God cannot imagine it 
any other way than that he now threatens to strike with 
a club. So here Joshua the priest, dejected and 
frightened by his sins, does not dare to continue. 
Therefore, he is strengthened and encouraged: the Lord 
is not angry; he has averted the rebuke of conscience 
and rebuke even Satan, who makes the heart so 
despondent through the greatness of sin that it does not 
continue to fulfill its calling. 


V. 2. The Lord rebuke you, you Satan. 


This is a wonderful and exceedingly sweet 
consolation. Everything in it is completely full of 
consolation, so suitably has he adapted all the words, as 
if he wanted to say: Lift yourself away, Satan. Set thyself 
no more against the priest, for the Lord commands that 
all that the priest timidly thinks of thy interposition, and 
so is deterred, shall be accursed. You bring him to the 
point that he is downcast before God and dares nothing 
before men; you act no differently than if the Lord had 
utterly rejected Jerusalem, but he has not rejected it, but 
has now chosen it and loves it as his own. 


Is this not a fire that is saved from the fire? 


You deal with the fact that Israel will be destroyed from 
the foundation and perish, that even the remnants will 
not remain unharmed, but the Lord will preserve the 
remnants and make them glorious and blessed. For this 
priest with the few remnants is no different than a 
firebrand snatched out of this terrifying captivity. But it is 
the same thing with 





Isaiah [Cap. 7, 4.], where he calls the two kings two 
smoking extinguishing brews, and above in Amos it says 
Cap. 3, 12: "Just as a shepherd pulls two knees out of 
the lion's mouth" 2c. These are miracles and great 
deeds of God. Thus he acts with his people as if he could 
not protect them at all, and lets them be devoured almost 
completely, 1) and yet he preserves very few, and 
protects them in such a way that no power, neither of the 
world nor of Satan, is so great that it is stronger than 
these few. 


V. 3 Joshua was dressed in unclean clothes and 
stood before the angel. 


Always the angel is added, so that quite actually the 
fight of the conscience before God is indicated. For the 
priest always had such thoughts silently with him, as it is 
shown here in the vision. What the unclean garments 
were, the prophet himself explains, namely the stained 
priesthood and the sins of the priest, by which he 
trembled and doubted whether his priesthood would 
please the Lord. It was the duty of the priest to pray for 
the sins of the people and to offer sacrifices for the sins. 
But Joshua the priest was troubled in his conscience and 
always thought that God was the avenger of sin, but he 
was a sinner; in vain would he intercede before God for 
the sins of the people. He could not visualize the 
goodness of GOtt, since he was frightened by the 
terrifying and lamentable rejection of the kingdom and 
the people. Therefore, he still thought that God was 
angry, that he would undertake anything in vain as a 
mere man, since things stood so distressed and so 
gloomy, indeed, so desperate. Therefore the 
uncleanness is taken away, and he is clothed with 
ceremonial garments. This is the comfort against sins, 
just as he was strengthened above against the 
temptations of Satan. By the way, so that | may also 
remind you of this, what Lyra and Jerome dream about 
the uncleanness of the garments in this passage is 
completely nonsense and fiction.

(teMdi sgeschunden Werdens. Perhaps UeZtutirl is to be read. 


2018 L. xxvm, so-53. interpretations on the prophets. 


2019 





V. 4. 1) Behold, | have taken away your sin from you. 


All this is shown in the vision, so that afterwards he 
may proclaim and reveal the will of God to the priest and 
strengthen him in such a way that he will not doubt that 
the Lord will approve of his service; the impurity has been 
removed, the sin has been taken away from him. And he 
is clothed with new clothes, that is, with a cheerful and 
confident conscience, which no longer flees from God, 
which does not even think of anything evil from God, but 
hopes for everything good. Thus, the ceremonial 
garments do not mean works, but grace and faith. By 
works the conscience is not adorned to attain peace 
before God, but by faith. And so the heart is strengthened 
by faith and is joyful, and does not fear the attempts and 
violence of all the heathen, not Satan, no longer worries 
because of sin, but despises it with a cheerful brow and 
accomplishes the work of the Lord with joy. 


V. 5. Put a clean hat on his head. 

The priestly hat was an ornament, see in the third 
book of Moses Cap. 8, 9. Now that the person is made 
righteous and worthy, the office is also approved. That is 
why the hat is put on here, so that he may continue to be 
a priest; the Lord will approve everything. The purity of 
the person must be there sooner than that of the office, 
because if the person is pure, then everything else is 
pure. For how can an impure man do pure works? A bad 
tree cannot bear good fruit 2c. 


V. 6. And the angel of the LORD testified unto 
Joshua, saying. 

After Satan has been driven back, the sins have been 
taken away and the priesthood has been confirmed, the 
angel adds an admonition in which he very delicately 
attaches the priesthood of Christ to the legal external 
priesthood. For all this happened only for the purpose 
and was arranged so that it was only a kind of 
preparation, and a very small one at that, for the future 
priesthood. 


1) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 


of the high priest of Christ. For for his sake alone 
everything happened. Because he was promised to 
come from this people, it was necessary that the people 
and the priesthood should last and be maintained until 
he came. Therefore, the opinion of the passage is: "Now 
that you have been placed in office, your works are 
pleasing, therefore continue and administer this priestly 
office of yours. If you do this. 


This is how you shall rule my house. 


That is, you shall be judge in my house, you shall 
preside over the people and rule in the things that belong 
to the service of God. But it is the law, he speaks legally, 
therefore it does not happen immediately, because it is 
a speech in the conjunctive, as the speech of the law 
tends to be. The gospel says [in the indicative: | do, | do 
2c. 


And | will give thee of these which stand here, that 
they may guide thee. 

Some interpret this from the angels. My very simple 
opinion is that it does not indicate angels, but that the 
Lord will also give people and listeners who will hear the 
priestly teacher, who will not despise him, and so the 
priesthood will be blessed. 


v.8. Listen, Joshua, you high priest. 


He beautifully connects these two priesthoods, the 
legal and the true one of the highest priest Christ, as if 
he wanted to say: Listen, high priest Joshua, what | want 
with this external priesthood of yours: | renew the 
promises of the future Christ. Denu that contain the 
manifold promises of the law, that Christ will be priest. 
Therefore, continue to preside in this outward priesthood 
until he comes. For his sake, both the people and the 
priesthood had to be restored, so that the promises 
would be true. 


For they are vain miracles. 


This is not to be taken in an evil sense, but in a good 
sense, that he calls them "miracles" (portentosos). 
Because the same opinion and 


2020 L. XXVIII, 53-ss. Interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 3, 8. 9. 


2021 





Isaiah Cap. 8, 18: "Behold, here am I, and the children 
whom the Lord hath given me, for a sign and for a wonder 
in Israel" 2c. Hence the opinion is, You and those who 
stand with you are wonders and marvels to the world, that 
is, as Paul interprets it [1 Cor.4, 9.], you are a spectacle 
GOtte, to the world and to the angels. For Christians 
undertake and attack things that are quite impossible, 
and quite remote from all reason. Everything is beyond 
human comprehension, as | have abundantly said above 
in the beginning of this chapter about the victory over 
Satan, death and conscience. 


For behold, | will send for my servant Zemah 
(orientem). 


This actually goes to Christ alone. By the way, instead of 
what we read [in the Vulgate]: orientem, we should read 
more correctly: germinantem, as the grasses or shrubs 
sprout and shoot out. Thus Christ is also called in Isaiah 
cap. 4, 2: "At that time the branch of the Lord will be dear 
and valuable." And Jer. 23:5: "I will raise up a righteous 
plant for David." So also here | would prefer that the word 
germen [branch] be used, so that one reads: "I will let my 
servant, the branch, come. But he calls Christ a branch, 
as also Isaiah calls him [Cap. 11, 1.] "a rod", which as a 
noble and glorious branch brings forth fruit, by which he 
indicates that the kingdom of Christ is always on the 
increase. For the Spirit and the Word of Christ are always 
growing, always running and gradually bringing forth 
more and more abundant fruit. The world opposes this 
branch with all its strength and efforts, so that it withers 
and makes it dry, it attacks it with death, with shame, with 
poverty and all evils, but God always makes it sprout, 
provides enough moisture so that it can sprout and bear 
fruit even in the greatest heat. 


V. 9 For behold, on the one stone | laid before 
Joshua. 


This is also what he is called in the Psalm [Ps. 118, 22.]: 
"The stone that the builders rejected 








And Isaiah says [Cap. 8:14], "A stone of stumbling, and 
a rock of trouble to the two houses of Israel." And Cap. 
28, 16: "Behold, | lay in Zion a foundation stone, a tried 
stone, a precious corner stone. "2c. But Christ is called a 
stone because all of us who are Christians lean on Him. 
He alone is our firm foundation on which to build, as Paul 
also interpreted [1 Car. 3:11. 


Shall be seven eyes. 


This is what Isaiah says [Cap. 61, 11: "The Spirit of 
the Lord is upon me, therefore the Lord has anointed 
me." Therefore the seven eyes are seven spirits or gifts 
of the Holy Spirit, which are distributed through Christ in 
the church. These gifts cause this branch to always 
sprout against the will of the world, the devil and all 
creatures. 


Behold, | will hew him out, saith the LORD of hosts. 


In the interpretation of this passage, the interpreters 
struggle in many ways. Some interpret it from the 
formation in the body of the Virgin, others from the 
adornment of the various gifts of the Holy Spirit, while this 
is already said through the seven eyes. But |, according 
to my opinion, think that by this "hewing out" 
(sculpturam) the sufferings of Christ are to be 
understood, as if he wanted to say: | will hew out my 
image work (sculpturam), that is, | will finally complete 
and prepare through the suffering, so that he is a corner 
stone, on which is built. For Christ is hewn out and 
formed through his suffering and resurrection, for thus he 
first began the right kingdom 2c. 


And will take away the sin of the same land for One 
Day. 

For in the day of suffering He bore the sin of us all, as 
Isaiah says [Cap. 53:4, 11], "He bore our sin." For God 
took away the sin of the whole world through Christ and 
in Christ crucified. Thus He indicates that He will finally 
be the true High Priest who will bear the sins of the 
people and deliver them from sins. This will 


2022 D- xxvm. 55-57. interpretations on the prophets. 


2023 





finally be the true sacrifice, which the priesthood of the 
legal priest Joshua is not able to offer. By the way, the 
fact that he says: "on one day", in one word he is 
dismissing the whole Old Testament, as if he wanted to 
say: another day will be necessary, and that alone will 
be enough, by this day the sins of the whole world will 
be taken away. He will accomplish everything through 
one sacrifice, so that there will be no need for another 
day, another priesthood or another sacrifice. See Hebr. 
7, 24. ff. 


V. 10. In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall one 


invite another 2c. 


This is spoken literally, as if to say, "Very often many 
promises have been made to you. 





full of your very great peace and supreme security have 
been inculcated. This, however, has not yet been 
fulfilled, but will be when he comes. His kingdom will be 
a kingdom of peace and security, that is, peace of 
conscience and abundance of all spiritual goods. Thus 
he takes a common saying and turns it around to the 
spirit, lest anyone think that such a peace and security 
is promised in the flesh and outwardly, because the 
Christian life is not a life of pleasure; "it does not go on 
with good days". For "all who want to live godly in Christ 
JEsu must suffer persecution" [2 Tim. 3, 12.], and thus 
become like the image of the Son of GOD 2c. [Rom. 8, 
29.] 


The fourth chapter. 


In the previous chapter we saw the abundant comfort 
with which the Lord, through the prophet, comforted the 
high priest, who was the leader of the people who had 
returned from captivity and rebuilt the temple and the city. 
Likewise, we have seen how the prophet himself, on his 
own initiative, acted the spiritual interpretation of the 
visions, namely that the high priest Joshua, who was 
dressed in a mourning garment and an unclean garment, 
took off the unclean garments and was finally dressed in 
ceremonial garments and clean garments, meant that 
one day there would be a priest who, by his suffering and 
death, would take away the sins of all, and by his 
resurrection would make us glorious and joint heirs of all 
the Father's goods. This priest was Christ JEsus 2c. 

After the consolation of this first leader now follows 
the consolation for the other leader, namely Zerubbabel. 
And as | have reminded above several times, that it is a 
very great thing and quite incomprehensible to human 
reason that the heart of man can certainly grasp the 
divine favor, especially when 





It is because it is oppressed by sin and feels the 
adversaries that it does not doubt that it has a favorable 
and gracious God that we need to be strengthened with 
so many words, with so many different visions and 
promises. Here we see that quite the same thing is done, 
since the prophet is again awakened to encourage and 
strengthen the leader, since things are so unfavorable, 
so that we clearly see that not everyone is so easily 
driven by the spirit, as some people boast in our times, 
who are full and puffed up by their opinion. The divine 
majesty holds its spirit too high to hold it in such low 
esteem. Therefore, one must not believe those impure 
people who boast about their spirit with such an insolent 
forehead and boastful words, which | have reminded 
above several times. 


V. 1. And the angel that talked with me came again. 


Here the prophet again begins a new sermon, which 
he preached at another time and on another day, after 
he had finished the previous one. 


2024 L. LXVIII, 57-59. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 4, 1-6. 


And woke me up like one is awakened from sleep. 


The prophet does not only indicate his heart position, 
since he, as it were lulled to sleep, is awakened, but also 
that of the leader and the whole people, as if he wanted 
to say: You are procrastinators, lazy and cold, in that you 
thus, as it were sleeping and snoring, omit the work of 
the Lord. And this indicates that: | am awakened like a 
sleeping man. Therefore, in the person of the prophet, 
the image of the whole people is to be understood, as it 
was to him. 


V. 2.1 see, and behold, there was a lampstand all of 
gold. 


The same device is also in Moses, 2nd book, 25, 31, 
where the tabernacle is described. But about the "bowl 
on top" (de lampade) many things have been disputed 
among the holy writers. We answer briefly that the 
prophet calls the recess or bowls 1) of the lampstand, in 
which the lamp is placed, "the bowls." But that he says 
[Vulg.]: "on its head" is a Hebrew way of speaking 
instead of: "on top of it", so that the opinion is: seven 
bowls 2c. 


V. 3. and two olive trees with it. 


Quite badly we read [in the Vulgate] "over it" [instead of 
"with it."], since immediately follows: "One on the right 
hand of the bowl, the other on the left." 
This is the second part of the face, but everything still 
seems inconsistent to those who do not yet understand 
the interpretation, which will be added immediately. Then 
everything will appear exceedingly sweet and pleasant. 
But here are frequent questions, both from the prophet 
to the angel, and from the angel to the prophet, so that 
we may see that the prophet has not made so many 
words in vain, but that everything serves to encourage 
the sleepy minds of the people. And so he made the 
listeners more attentive, since he dwelt on these 
questions, and kept their hearts in suspense, so that they 
might, as it were, open their mouths and carefully 
consider what the Lord wanted with the vision 2c.

probably read from: schussel.

V. 6. 2) It shall not be by army or war, but by my 
Spirit. 
This is the interpretation of the face, which does not 
seem to fit completely according to the appearance. For 
what does the spirit have in common with lamps and 
candlesticks, or what is there for an equal? But in fact it 
is fitting, and everything rhymes exceedingly well. Now it 
is as if he wanted to say: Serubabel, your heart is still 
taken by carnal thoughts, that you are almost stunned, 
they make your heart so staggering. For you know that 
the temple is to be rebuilt according to the word of the 
Lord, but you fear the enemy kings and nations, so that 
you do not continue. You do not see that you can stand 
up to such great power and violence of the adversaries. 
But the Lord says that it is not weapons, men and force 
that are needed, none of these things are necessary, but 
only light and spirit that you may have a right confidence 
of heart. 
And with these words he hits as with a needle the 
thoughts of Zerubbabel about the force, the weapons 
and the violence of the adversaries. But he tells him to 
be sure against all this, that nothing is necessary but 
faith, which does not distrust the Lord. When he will be 
there, he promises, he will easily drive back and break all 
weapons, power and authority, however great it may be, 
even that of the whole world. This is a very good passage 
about the confidence of the heart that comes through 
faith, by which the godly are secure and undaunted 
against all violence of the enemy, both physical and 
spiritual, just as in the outward victory of the wicked all 
power and the success of the victory lies in the strength 
of the heart, so that he seems to have said quite rightly: 
"The courage is mightier than the hand; all strength lies 
in that. | have also heard this from those who once fought 
in the line of battle, that one can conclude and determine 
which army will perish by very certain assumptions and 
clear signs before one would join hands. For in the one, 
everything indicates the downfall and points to it, since 
everything is in consternation, as it were.

2026 L. xxvm, 59-61. interpretations on the prophets. 


2027 





The horses also hung their heads and seemed to 
suspect something sad. In contrast, in the other, which 
will be victorious, everything promises victory: the hearts 
of all the men of war are lively, the horses neigh, in short, 
there is nothing that does not promise a certain victory. 
Only the courage that the Lord gives to those of whom 
he wants to become victors is victorious. Thus the 
Germans also say in a well-known word, and quite 
rightly: "God protect me from one who means me" 2c. 
Therefore, since this happens to the wicked, how much 
more do the godly prevail and break through, 
encouraged by faith and the Spirit. 

Then all that the Prophet saw by the vision is of gold, 
nothing of iron suitable for weapons, but everything is 
golden. For there is no use for gold in war, but it indicates 
peace. Then the lampstand shines as if to say, "Light 
and fire are needed. For the Holy Spirit shines, that is, 
he kindles and enlightens the heart so that it is secure 
and courageous and fears nothing. 

So everything fits in the most suitable way in the face. 
Therefore, those who want to interpret Moses may learn 
here, since the opportunity for reflection is given, that 
already in the whole construction and the furnishing of 
the Mosaic tabernacle the Lord did not want to mean 
anything else than what is carried out here by the 
ministry of the word on the whole earth. The table means 
the word of God, which is clear from the Psalm [Ps. 23, 
5]: He has prepared a table before me 2c. Likewise [Ps. 
69, 23.], "Let their table become a snare before them." 
For the Word is meat, and feeds us "toward the north" 
(for so the table was set in the tabernacle, as the text in 
Moses [2nd book, Cap. 26, 35.) says), that is, against 
the temptations of Satan. The lampstand is a sign of 
peace, for it is of gold. For where the word is preached, 
there is no violence, no war or weapons, but they dwell 
in peace and quiet. Therefore, the lampstand is the 
ministry of the Word, by which the church is instructed 
and nourished. The altar of incense is the right prayer, 
which is done in faith and the Holy Spirit, which can only 
be performed by those who have the Spirit. 





of Christ. So others may continue to think about this 
matter, because it is a large and wide area. The right 
lampstand, which the prophet sees in this vision, stands 
in the middle of two oil trees, which are Zerubbabel and 
the high priest Joshua, as if he wanted to say: There is 
nothing that you have to fear, the Holy Spirit is in the 
middle of you, he shines in the middle of you, therefore 
no weapons, no violence are necessary, you have me 
as a gracious and kind God. 

The various instruments around the lampstand are 
the ministers of the Word, who, adorned with various 
gifts of the Holy Spirit, carry out the ministry of the Word, 
for not everyone has been given all the gifts. The apostle 
Paul spoke abundantly about this in the 12th chapter of 
the first letter to the Corinthians and in the 4th chapter of 
the letter to the Ephesians. "The ladles" (infusoria) 
mean the prophets, but "the bowls" (lances) mean the 
preachers, who pass on to others what they have 
received from the prophets 1) (for not all have been 
granted to penetrate into all the most hidden things of 
the Scriptures), which are many ornaments of light, but 
all is of gold 2c. 


V. 7. Who are you, you great mountain, which must 
be a plain before Zerubbabel? 


This also still belongs to the face. The teaching is 
fulfilled, that is, the vision is laid out, now he exhorts. But 
he makes a sudden turn against the enemies in order to 
strengthen Zerubbabel, just as he had suddenly 
addressed Satan in the third chapter [v. 2]: "The Lord 
rebuke thee, thou Satan" 2c. And just as in all the 
previous pieces of this chapter he had his attention very 
precisely on the thoughts of Zerubbabel, so also this part 
refers preferably to it. For he imagines that he had such 
thoughts: What shall |, a few men, be able to do against 
the very mighty kings and the bitterest enemies? For the 
Scriptures call the princes and nobles mountains and 
hills. And so he imagines the whole multitude of the 
adversaries, viz. 


1) Instead of propiktieik should be read Wohl xroxiktis. 


2028 L. xxvm, 61-03. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), cap. 


4, 7-9. 2029 





The prophet, who had seen the kings of the Persians 
and the very powerful peoples as a great mountain, 
looked at the multitude of enemies, the violence of the 
weapons and the strength of the armies, which 
frightened everyone and made him stop the work he had 
started. Therefore, the prophet calls him back to faith 
and spirit, then it will easily happen that this mountain 
will become a plain, however big it appears. But, to 
remind also this, here some divide the text in various 
ways. | distinguish and read simply like this: Who are 
you, great mountain? before Zerubbabel [you become] 
a plain, so that it is a rebuke of the enemy or of the great 
mountain, as if he wanted to say: The Lord rebuke you, 
you great mountain, who hinder the leader Zerubbabel, 
so that he cannot promote the work he has begun 
according to the will of the Lord. "To the plain" (in 
planum it says in the Vulgate]), so that here is an 
elliptical speech, as if he wanted to say: May you be 
made a plain by the Lord, so that you do not resist the 
leader any further, do not inspire him with more terror. 


And he shall execute the first stone. 


That is, even against your will, even after you are 
made level, when your power is destroyed, Zerubbabel 
will bring up the first stone, that is, he will promote and 
complete the work that has been started, after the 
foundation has already been laid by him under King 
Cyrus. He will complete the temple of the Lord and 
continue to build it up as he laid the foundation. 


That one will shout, good luck, good luck! 


This passage [in the Vulgate: Et exaequabit gratiam 
gratiae ejus] is obscure, and | cannot determine 
anything certain about it, because in it there is more than 
one Hebrew way of speaking. The sacred writers have 
struggled in many ways to make many graces (gratiis), 
but they are void things. | will indicate what | think. First 
of all, | translate thus according to the Hebrew: And 
under shouting or congratulating: Congratulations. So 
that the opinion is: That great mountain, which until now 
was a hindrance to Zerubbabel, will be made a plain. 
Then he will place the first stone like this, 


will build up the temple already begun in such a way that 
there will be shouting and congratulations, not only from 
one man, but from all nations (which he indicates by the 
repetition), and so all will shout: So that completely the 
same opinion is there, as it is found in Haggai [Cap. 2, 
10.] of the glory of the last temple: "The glory of this last 
house shall be greater than that of the first" 2c. But 
according to the Hebrew way he made use of the 
doubling, as if he wanted to say: The peoples from all 
over the world will run to wish happiness because of the 
building of the temple, while it now lies despised. But in 
Scripture the word gratia means favor, as Proverbs 1:9: 
"For such is a beautiful ornament (gratia) to thy head." 
Likewise elsewhere: favor (gratia) is deceptive and 
beauty is vain. Here it does not mean both favor and that 
which looks very well and makes pleasant (gratiosum), 
as if to say, Moreover, much ornament will be added to 
this temple, "many more beautiful jewels ("kleyneth") will 
be hung on it." Because the peoples will compete, as it 
were with noise and raving, that they decorate this 
temple, which also happened afterwards. So such 
repetitions are always to be understood dis- tributive. 
So in Ezekiel: Homo homo de domo Israe, that is, each 
one of the house of Israel. And in Moses: Virgam et 
virgam etc. his every one a staff, Ex. 12, 11.] 


V. 9. The hands of Zerubbabel founded this house. 


He interprets with clearer words what he seemed to 
have said above with darker words, namely, about the 
setting up of the first stone and the building of the temple 
and the great glory of the last temple, namely, that many 
Gentiles would stream in competitively and wash away 
Serubabel's happiness, as Paul says of the Christians 
[Tit. 2, 14], that they be diligent (Sectatores) to good 
works or eiserer (zelotes), that is, that they compete 
with one another in good works, that one strive to 
precede the other in good works. Such a competition, 
says 


2030 L. XXVIIL "3-66. interpretations on the prophets. 


The opinion of this passage is that the temple will be 
completed within the lifetime of Zerubbabel, however 
much less is expected now that things are so favorable. 
2c. It is therefore the opinion of this passage: still in the 
lifetime of Zerubbabel the temple will be completed, as 
much as nothing less is expected now, since things are 
so unfavorable, and when the work is completed, you will 
finally know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you, 
that is, that | have preached this by command of the 
LORD. Only then will the will of the Lord be revealed, 
which is now completely neglected, since there are many 
things that make you endure that you do not obey the 
words and will of the Lord. 


It is a great thing and beyond all human 
comprehension to know that any work is pleasing to God, 
which otherwise appears to be contemptible and small in 
the eyes of the world, as the temple was a small thing. 
The world judged that nothing was less pleasing to God 
than any such house. Therefore Satan opposed it with all 
his power, so that the will of God would not be obeyed, 
so that what the Lord wanted would not happen, as he 
could not help but always oppose the things that belong 
to godliness and worship. Such is the nature of this 
mischievous spirit, which can suffer everything else 
rather than that which concerns God. There is no doubt 
that many great buildings were erected all over the world 
when the Temple was built, but this wicked spirit did not 
care about all of them; only what was of God, what was 
intended for the glory of God, was challenged. This is 
what he always does. For we know his thoughts: "He is 
sorry that a man has eyes." In this way he always 
pursues not only our soul, but also our health. We have 
now seen this in the quite frightening example of the 
rebellious and stormy peasants, in whom one can clearly 
recognize the wickedness and power of Satan 2c. But the 
will of God exists, and what the Lord wants will finally be 
carried out, no matter how much Satan and all the gates 
of hell resist. 


V. 10 For who is he that despiseth these few days? 








2031 


Again, he helps their faintheartedness by leading 
them away from the appearance of things or from the 
difficulty of execution to his word, namely, that they 
should not imagine the greatness of the matter, the 
threatening dangers, the power of the neighboring 
heathen, but his will, as if he wanted to say: It is a great 
mountain that sets itself against you, strongly you are 
attacked on all sides; all this produces difficulty and a 
certain distrust in your hearts; everything seems 
desperate, your forces are nothing compared to the 
forces of your adversaries, therefore the days seem 
small, that is, days in which the things, the people, and 
the works seem small, since everything is conducted with 
not even happy success. But why do you care about 
these things, why do you not rather believe me who 
speak, why do you not [rather] have your eyes firmly fixed 
on my word than on your pusillanimity? | can soften 
everything exceedingly difficult and transform it into the 
very easiest. Thus divine goodness, according to its way, 
makes everything out of nothing, out of the most 
desperate state of all things the highest bliss, out of 
disgrace honor, out of ashes gold, however completely 
different it is before the eyes. Namely, this is how he 
looks at their innermost heart movements. 


In that one will rejoice and see the tin measure in 
Serubabel's hand. 


The Hebrews, which do not have impersonal verba, 
cannot express impersonal phrases so comfortably, as 
Christ also speaks in the Gospel [Luc. 6, 38. Vulg.]: "They 
will give into your bosom", instead of: one will give. 
Likewise [Matth. 13, 41. f.]: "They will gather and throw," 
instead of: one will gather. So here: buntur, etc., 
meaning, "one will rejoice." But this whole passage is 
ambiguous, because of the twofold sense it may have. 
The first is that the prophet speaks of the kingdom of 
Judah, that it will rejoice over the temple that has been 
raised, and so the tin measure becomes the temple that 
is made under the leader Zerubbabel, completed and 
excellently executed 2c. But in my opinion, everything 
seems to be related to Christ. 


2032 "xxvm. 66-68. interpretation of Zechariah. (2.) 


Cap. 4, 10. 2033 








For the sake of which the temple was rebuilt and the 
people were brought back from captivity, since Christ 
was promised to the Jews. He was to be born of their 
flesh, therefore the kingdom and the priesthood had to 
be preserved. In short, the whole time after the 
Babylonian captivity awaited Christ, and everything 
happened for Christ's sake. But one can see the 
wonderful counsel of the dear God, how he acts 
according to his way, that he always calls to that which 
is not, that it is [Rom. 4, 17.], and leads into hell before 
he leads into heaven 2c. [Since he wanted the king 
Christ to come as soon as possible, as he had promised, 
he let the Persians gain the supremacy, after the Jewish 
people had been led away miserably into captivity, so 
that nothing was less in view, since the kingdom and the 
priesthood with the whole people had been transferred 
to a foreign country, than that the people should be 
brought back, the temple restored and the people 
reinstated to their former dignity, yes, also the kingdom 
should be an eternal one, as was promised. Therefore, 
the prophets always connect the kingdom of Christ with 
the present time and the last glory that would come 
through the King Christ, as we have also seen above, 
Cap. 3, 9. as he added the passage about the stone that 
would take away the sin of the land 2c. This passage 
cannot be understood otherwise than by Christ. So also 
Haggai adds Cap. 2, 10. 8. immediately adds: "And | will 
give peace in this place, saith the LORD," and "there 
shall come then the consolation of all nations." As if he 
wanted to say: After the temple is built, Christ will follow 
immediately and set up the kingdom. And this is the first 
reason by which | am moved to believe that this passage 
is to be understood of Christ. The other reason is that he 
expressly distinguishes between the one stone and the 
other; at first he spoke of the cornerstone of the last 
temple, which was not to be erected without great glory, 
applause and the congratulations of many, as we have 
said, but here he mentions another stone, referring to 
the previous sermon, which he preached before the 
priest. 





Joshua stopped from the delicious stone. The third 
reason is that he repeats the seven eyes. It is known that 
by the seven number he indicates the Holy Spirit and all 
the gifts of the Spirit. 

Therefore, the summa of this saying is as if to say, 
"The days seem few to you, but you do not know what | 
will do or undertake, for | will do more wonderful and 
glorious things in these few days than | have ever done 
before. "I will cause a joy", it will be a great joy. The 
cause of this joy will be 


[The tin measure.] 


The pewter stone or the pewter lump. He calls it 
"pewter" to distinguish it from the first stone or 
cornerstone, so that the opinion is: "It will be pewter, that 
is, white, polished, smooth, like tin. This stone is the 
resurrected Christ, who is laid at the foundation of the 
Church through the preaching of the apostles. This 
sermon gave rise to the highest joy, because it 
proclaimed only joyful and happy things, namely grace 
and eternal life. And this stone will be seen, he says. 


In Serubabel's hand, 


Although Zerubbabel was not alive when Christ was 
born. But this is the way of the prophets, that they speak 
in this way. It is also said of Christ that he will sit on the 
throne of David, and above, Cap. 3, 9, the Lord says that 
he will set up his precious stone before Joshua the 
priest. And it is the opinion: this government of Joshua 
the priest, which is now restored, this people, which is 
now under Joshua the priest, will see that stone. This is 
also how what is said here about Zerubbabel is to be 
understood, namely that the tin stone will be seen in the 
hand of Zerubbabel 


With the seven, which are the eyes of the Lord, 


For this is how | read and connect, that is, with the 
Holy Spirit. For the gospel at the same time brings Christ 
with the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which run through the 
whole world, since the gospel is preached everywhere. 


2034 L. xxvm, 68-7o. Interpretations on the prophets.

is preached. But he calls the Holy Spirit an eye, because 
the kingdom of Christ is a kingdom of faith, which 
consists only in knowledge, as Isaiah says [Cap. 53, 11.]: 
"By his knowledge he, his servant, will watch many 
righteously" 2c. This knowledge he calls an eye. This is 
how the prophet himself wanted to attach his spiritual 
interpretation to the face of the bodily things, and this is 
how he lays out the right temple and the right lampstand. 
This is the way of the prophets. 


v. ii. What are the two oil trees? 


Now he understands what the lampstand is, but it still 
grieves him that he had not seen the lampstand between 
two oil trees in the tabernacle of Moses. Therefore a 
question arises for him here. 


V. 12, 1) And | answered the second time, and said 
unto him, What are the two branches (spicae) of the olive 
trees? 


One has struggled with the interpretation of this 
passage in various ways: one interprets it from the grace, 
another differently. | simply follow my opinion, which | 
have also expressed above: that the two oil trees are the 
twofold regiment, that of the Mosaic law through Joshua, 
and that of the external world regiment through 
Zerubbabel. Therefore, | simply understand by these 
branches or oil trees the One Jewish people who had this 
twofold regiment, so that the opinion is: this people is in 
God's favor, it has the lampstand in its midst, that is, the 
Holy Spirit is ready to supply this twofold regiment until 
Christ comes. In the meantime, none of them will be 
unfruitful, since ears (spicae) will appear, that is, 
everything in this kingdom will be in bloom, so that it will 
bear fruit to God and His word. 


Which stand by the two golden beaks 
(rostra). 

Rostra he calls the mouths (nares) of the lamps, "the 
beaks". So also Moses wants that the mouths of the 
lamps are opposite to each other [2 Mos. 25, 37]. So also 
here 


1) This verse number and keyword is missing in the Weimar. 





The prophet placed the beaks straight opposite each 
other, with one oil tree on the right and the other on the 
left. 


V. 14. They are the two oil children. 


[Children of the oil, that is, children of the splendor. 2) 
This is the second part of the interpreted face, that is, 
Joshua with his spiritual regiment, and Zerubbabel with 
his worldly regiment, these are the children of the oil, that 
is, the children of happiness and well-being. For thus the 
Hebrew language is wont to speak, as, in the Psalm [Ps. 
80:15-18.]: 3) ["Hold thy hand] over the child of thy right 
hand." In Latin this is spoken unrhymed, but it is the 
same, 4) which we express in Latin thus: [super vineam] 
quae est res dextrae tuae [over the vine, which is a 
work of thy right hand]. For what would be less befitting 
to Latin ears than to call a vine a child of the right hand? 
So it is also said Is. 5, 1.: In cornu filio olei ["in a fat 
place"]. Many psalms are full of such Hebrew idioms. 
Thus the prophet again admonished and encouraged the 
leader with many words, so that he would continue 
cheerfully and vigorously to build the temple that was 
begun according to the will of the Lord, without fearing 
anything, no matter how difficult it might seem to 
undertake it. For all the works of God are such that they 
go against all the thoughts and senses of human reason. 
They seem to be quite impossible, which is why the godly 
do not rush to perform them, but, trembling and 
fainthearted, can hardly be enticed and moved by many 
and exceedingly rich consolations to take upon 
themselves their office, that they may do what is 
commanded them by the Lord, which | have very 
abundantly said above. And therefore it is evident how 
one must not trust those obdurate boasters who say that 
they feel nothing but the Spirit, who very easily subject 
themselves to every thing 2c.

2036 XXVIII, 10-72. interpretation of Zechariah (2,), Cap. 5, 1. 2. 


2037 


The fifth chapter. 


This chapter has been dealt with in many ways by the 
sacred writers, but we will leave such trivial things and 
human opinions and tackle the matter ourselves as best 
we can. 

In the previous chapters, the prophet admonished 
and strengthened the leader, the priest and the people, 
which we have interpreted enough and more than 
enough. Then he applied everything to the future and 
imminent kingdom of Christ, which he described as 
being a kingdom of joy and supreme rest. 2c. In this 
chapter he will now proceed in the manner of all 
prophets. This is the characteristic of all prophets, that 
they not only describe the blessedness of Christ's 
kingdom in very rich and lovely words, but also add the 
faithlessness and the terrible fall of Israel, which did not 
want to receive and acknowledge this King and Savior 
Christ. And so they preach by visions, by lamentations 
and many prophecies the eternal and miserable fall of 
the people. 

The apostles also followed this way. Paul and Peter 
clearly proclaim that after the preaching of the gospel 
wolves will break in, false teachers, who will rage against 
the host of the Lord according to their will and trample 
everything underfoot. So also says the prophet Daniel 
[Cap. 12, 10.P. "And the ungodly shall lead ungodly 
lives" 2c. Quite the same as | have said does Zechariah 
here. Since he had prophesied of the tin measure, he 
immediately adds at the same time what shall happen to 
this people, which will not receive this kingdom of Christ. 
And this is the summa of the whole chapter. Actually, it 
refers to the Pharisees, Sadducees and the other 
scribes, whom Christ found among his people when he 
announced himself as king and savior, whom he also left 
behind. 


V. 1. And | lifted up mine eyes again, and saw. 
He had before his eyes the spirit that comforted the 
prince Zerubbabel and the people, as we 





He saw how after the restoration of the kingdom and the 
priesthood the temple should be rebuilt, but he sees 
behind sad and terrible things, which would happen soon 
after, after those exceedingly happy things were over. 
And this is what the prophet means when he says [in the 
Vulgate: Et conversus sum] that he turned and saw a 
flying book, just as Abraham, looking back when he was 
about to sacrifice Isaac, saw a ram with its horns hanging 
in the thorns 2c. [Gen. 22:13.] 


And behold, it was a flying letter (volumen). 


The likeness is quite suitable and delicate. A book 
(volumen) can indicate nothing else than the doctrine or 
the law, because here is nothing of warlike things, no 
swords, no horses, no weapons. The prophet therefore 
sees that after him would come a kind of godless 
doctrine, for there arose sects, the Sadducees, 
Pharisees and Essaeans. 


V. 2. 1) Itis twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide. 


Here some raise a question about the numbers. | 
simply think that if there is a secret in the numbers, that 
by the number the width and the length of Solomon's 
portico is indicated, and that this is alluded to, as if he 
wants to show that by this book not right things are 
taught, but only external things, as the portico was 
outside the temple. Or else | would have the number 
simply referred to the history of the face, namely, that the 
heresies and ungodly doctrines creep and spread far, 
having many who follow their destruction, as Peter says 
[2 Ep. 2, 2.], that thus the greatness of the book indicates 
the power and effectiveness of ungodly doctrine. The 
prophet himself interprets the book, saying:

V. 3: This is the curse that goes out over the whole 
land. 


This is, of course, a good price to pay for ungodly 
doctrine, that he calls it a curse. For it takes away the 
blessing and the grace that is offered to all through the 
gospel. Because this is a word to blessedness, therefore 
it is called a word of blessing, as [Gen. 12:3.], "In thy 
seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed," that 
is, blessing shall be proclaimed to them through the 
gospel, for it takes away wrath and vengeance, and 
bestows the blessing and favor of GOD. 

And to this passage the apostle seems to have 
looked more than once, since with such large and 
vehement words he often attacks doctrine which is not 
sound, as also in the Epistle to the Galatians [Cap. 3, 
10.], "They that deal in the works of the law are under 
the curse." 


Across the country, 
Namely, the Jewish one. 


For all thieves are spoken of piously according to 
this letter. 1) 


The Hebrew text seems to mean something quite 
different [from that of the Vulgate), for one reads 
according to the Hebrew thus: For every thief will be 
declared innocent after this in such a manner. And such 
is the proper meaning of the Hebrew word, nor do | 
remember it ever having any other meaning in Scripture. 
For it is quite the same verbum Ps. 19:14: "Then shall | 
be without change, and" be cleansed, or "remain 
innocent of great iniquity." Therefore also what follows 
must be translated thus: all [falsely] swearing will be 
declared equally innocent according to the same, as if 
he wanted to say: This book is such that it gives freedom 
to sin, and promises hope of impunity; "it makes the boys 
free" that they can do anything according to their will. For 
in this way the papist laws have also given freedom to 
the missal priests and the 


1) Vulgate: Omnis kur, sieut idi seripturn est, juaieabitur. 


He [the pope] even allows robbery and theft, if only a part 
of the booty falls to him, so that he can gather money 
and goods under the pretext of religion, rightly or 
wrongly. In this way, perjurers are also absolved. This 
actually belongs to the doctrine, because all doctrine 
comes under the name of the Lord, and also all 
preachers confirm their doctrine with the name of the 
Lord, saying that they come in the name of the Lord, 
which is clear from all the prophets. So also Christ 
confirmed his teaching by an oath. The summa of this 
passage is therefore this: The doctrine that is to come is 
of such a nature that it will teach ungodliness, so that by 
theft will be signified all shameful laws that serve robbery 
and gain, and by perjury will be signified all ungodly laws 
that serve ungodliness. This is quite clear when we look 
at the Pabstium. One part of Pabstism is that it teaches 
trust in works against Christ and the grace in Christ 
shown to the world; the other part is that, as | have said, 
the decrees of Pabst reek only of avarice, which is also 
confessed by the teachers of the decrees themselves. 
And so they first rob souls through ungodly doctrine, and 
then they also rob bodies by sucking out people's 
possessions and goods through deceit and all kinds of 
falsifications. This is how this passage can be 
understood, because the Pharisees also did the same, 
as is evident from the Gospel history, how they were 
intent on their belly and their avarice, as Christ punishes 
them with a very severe rebuke Matth. 23, 14: "You who 
devour widows' houses" 2c. [as he says, v. 16.] of 
swearing by the gold at the temple 2c. Then the ungodly 
doctrine, namely by teaching trust in works, as all the 
evangelists are full of, as they always resisted Christ in 
his teaching. And it cannot be otherwise than that, when 
we have lost Christ and the right doctrine, we blindly 
serve our lusts and have the belly to our God, as the 
apostle says. For in this way all that the monks and the 
ministers of the Mass have acquired in the most unjust 
way.

V. 4. But | will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts. 


|, he says, will bring this book to light, that is, when they 
have sinned enough with their ungodly doctrine, when 
they have come to the highest, then | will make known 
how all theirs is ungodly theft and perjury; | will make 
known the ungodliness of the doctrine, that under the 
pretense of the name of God they have only been a ruin 
of souls and have led my name uselessly, as he says 
here: ["It shall come] upon the house of those who swear 
falsely by my name."]. This revelation of error has come 
through the gospel, which has come to the house of 
thieves and of those who swear falsely, that is, he has 
taken vengeance on them by making their ungodly error 
manifest, and, as they themselves have devoured both 
the souls and the bodies of men, so shall they in turn be 
devoured altogether with all that is theirs. Namely so 
even | will not suffer it unpunished 2c. No one could deny 
that this is clearer than the sun at noon, for the Jews are 
so exceedingly miserable scattered over the whole world 
that they do not have even a small place where they can 
safely dwell; everywhere they are exiled and rejected 
and blinded by God. And this is the first face, now follows 
the other. 


V. 5 Lift up thine eyes, and behold, what cometh 
out? 
This likeness also goes to the same thing, because this 
prophet has the way that he almost always uses two 
visions to one and the same thing, which we have also 
seen in the previous. 


V. 6. 7. 1) [And | said, What is it? but he said, An 
ephah goeth forth 2c.] 
So he sees an ephah going out (but it is a common 
measure with the Jews, as with us it is the bushel; a 
gomer was the tenth part of an ephah; we might translate 
it by barrel [metretam]), Secondly, he sees 


1) The verse number "6." is in the Weimar only at the following 
keyword. The verse number "7." is missing. 


He sees a penny of lead and a woman sitting in the 
middle of the barrel, but in such a way that the woman 
protrudes above the barrel, since she is elevated by her 
hurried seat. He sees the hundredweight of lead flying 
towards him, which was so large that it completely 
covered the mouth of the barrel, as he immediately adds, 
since the woman was frightened that the hundredweight 
of lead was thrown at her mouth, that is, at the mouth of 
the barrel. The prophet himself interprets the woman, but 
not equally the penny. Very beautifully, however, the 
godless life is described, therefore the reason or the 
cause of the parable must be searched, why he had 
used these things. 


This is their figure (oculus) throughout the land. 


That is, the appearance and shape of what is in the 
land. For this is how the Hebrew language uses the word 
"eye" (oculi). Ps. 6:8 (Vulg.): "My eye is dim with 
mourning." Likewise in the second book of Moses (Cap. 
10, 13. according to the Hebrew]: "The locusts covered 
the eye of the land," that is, the all-seeing and the 
surface. It is therefore the same opinion as Paul says [2 
Tim. 3, 5.]: "Those have the appearance of a godly 
being, but his power they deny." By this the prophet 
meant to indicate that the barrel is the image or figure 
which follows their doctrine. Thus the appearance of the 
papist decrees consists in caps, plates, cords with which 
they gird themselves, ceremonies, certain days, certain 
formulas of prayer 2c. Everything is measured in the 
most exact way, as it were with a metre, everything is 
put into certain forms, bound to certain places, times and 
persons. Thus the form of the measure refers to 
ungodliness. But the use of the measure goes to avarice, 
because they are only fit to consume the fruits. "They are 
gluttons", belly servants, since the belly is their god. But 
in this measure sits not a man, but a woman, that is 
human reason. The godless heart and godless delusion 
governs all this, not the Holy Spirit, while they think to 
please GOtte. But she sits, that is, she sits on top, she 
rules, she teaches, as Christ says (Matth. 23, 2.]: "They 
sit on Mosi's chair" Then, that he says: "in the whole 
country", means that the godless

Doctrine eats away, not unlike cancer, as Paul says [2 
Tim. 2:17]. 

"The centner of lead" 1) but hovers in the air, that is, 
hypocrisy is uoch not suppressed, sits still safe, but he 
sees the future suppression of godlessness, as he adds. 


Vv. 8. and he threw them into the ephah, and threw 
the lump of lead on top of the hole. 


That is, he took away her sitting, he makes her 
dismayed, since she was pushed into the barrel from the 
high seat by which she was raised above the barrel 
before, and so, since the centner of lead was thrown on 
the mouth of the barrel, she is covered in it. That is, 
ungodliness is indeed cast down by the gospel, it is put 
to shame, but it is not ameliorated. Hypocrisy always 
remains, it cannot be improved, even those who are so 
devoted to hypocrisy harden themselves even more and 
sink deeper into their ungodliness, however hard they 
are overcome and put to shame by the gospel. We see 
this happening to our lines, just as it happened to the 
Jews, however much they were punished by Christ. And 
so they still lie sunk in their error, so that there is no hope 
that they will come out. Yes, every day they only 
blaspheme more, therefore they are even more blinded, 
since they are most miserably rejected by God, have no 
temple, no kingdom, no priesthood, no public schools. 
When they teach something, they teach their own; when 
they teach people, they teach their people, and in their 
corners they murmur privately, pushed away into this 
barrel, and so closed that they cannot come out. The 
same will happen to our 2) despisers of the gospel, in 
that the gospel will be taken away again if the world 
should stand any longer. 

"The lump of lead" is completely the same, what the 
prophets call "burden", as when they say [Zech. 12, 1.]: 
"The burden of the word of the Lord" 2c. In short, it is the 
burden of the judgment of the Lord, by which their heart 
and 


1) In our prelims: auri instead of: pluradi. 
2) Instead of nokis we have assumed nostris. 


conscience is oppressed, since they, so immersed in 
hypocrisy, cannot come out. For, as | have said, the Jews 
who are ruined by the gospel, having completely fallen 
away from the faith, stick to their works. They stubbornly 
hold on to them, but still their consciences are so upset 
and frightened, no matter how much they struggle with 
many works, that they never dare to lift up their heads 
freely; so weighed down is their heart and their mind. 
They never boast and are once happy in God, they never 
come to taste the goodness and mercy of God; they are 
most severely pressed by that lead. And this happens 
with necessity to all hypocrisy, which at first pretends an 
excellent appearance, as | said above, but it comes to 
this end 2c. And this is what the Psalm says, on this 
opinion: The wicked will be straitened in their distresses. 
For this is the way of hypocrisy, that it brings the 
conscience into 'straits, decisively, and oppressively. On 
the other hand, the Holy Spirit leads out into the wide 
space, that is, into freedom; he straightens the heart, and 
makes the conscience joyful and satisfied. For this word 
is used in the Scripture Ps. 18, 20: "And he led me out 
into space." Likewise [Ps. 119, 32. Vulg.], "Thou makest 
my heart wide," 2c. But [Isa. 57, 21.], "The wicked have 
not peace." 


V. 9. And behold, two women came out. 
That is, two women were brought in or paraded or 
walked out. 


And had wings that the HErr drove (Vontné in rUi8 
oarnm). 

That is, their wings moved before the wind. They had 
movable wings, just as Isaiah [Cap. 6, 2.] also saw the 
seraphim flying with two wings. 


But they were wings like stork wings (a1a8 
inilvi). 

Already several times | have reminded that the 
Hebrew grammarians are of very different opinion about 
words which mean things, as one is also doubtful here 
concerning the word which our Latin interpreter 


2044 n. xxvin, 78-80. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), cap. 


5, 9-11. 2045 





translated by milvus. | translated: herons, following the 
passage in the Psalm [Ps. 104, 17.]: "The herons dwell 
on the firs." 


And they led the ephah between earth and heaven. 


That is, flying at the same time, they led the ephah 
thus closed with the lead raised between heaven and 
earth. 


V. 11. 1) That a house may be built for him in the 
land of Siuear, and prepared. 


"In the land of Siuear." Where Sinear was located is 
clear from Genesis 11:2, where it is described that the 
children of Noah went towards the east and found the 
land of Sinear, in which the Babylonian tower was built. 
In this place it is said that it was a very large and lovely 
plain. Furthermore, instead of what we read [in the 
Vulgate]: et stabiliatur, it is more correctly read: "and 
prepared". Now we will deal with how this face 3) is to be 
understood. After the ephah was closed by the lead, the 
prophet saw that it was taken away again out of sight, 
high up in the air. This indicates that the wickedness will 
not remain in this people, but will be taken to another 
place by these two flying women. The leading away is 
completely reversed. The Jews have been transferred 
from Babylon to Jerusalem, but the ephah is taken away 
from Jerusalem to Babylon. In sum, this indicates that 
they are to be completely eradicated and cast out of the 
church in whose place we are planted, as Paul 
abundantly explains in the letter to the Romans [Cap. 11, 
17. 19. 23. f.]. But he is led away by wives. But he 
indicates the office of teaching, for there is no doubt that 
the two cherubim in Moses and Isaiah signify the office 
of the word, since in their midst the grace-

before the next section. This has a certain justification, because in the 
following the whole face v. 9-11. is summarized. 

2) In our original: Oenes. e. 10. For this, however, one can refer 
to Cap. 10, 10. but not rightly. 

3) Instead of verkionis we have assumed visionis. 





The word is the chair, that is, Christ, to whom all 
Scripture is directed, and of whom alone the ministry of 
the word is concerned. They have wings, because the 
word flies, runs fast. This is also what the poets wanted 
to express with their winged god Mercurius, from where 
he also got his name, why he was called Epuing 4), as 
Virgil also depicts the rumor winged, because no other 
evil has a greater mobility 2c. Therefore, just as in the 
godly service of the pure word this is signified by the 
wings, here also in the ungodliness the ungodly office of 
the ungodly word is signified. Therefore, the two winged 
women mean everything that the Jews teach or their 
ungodly word. But the women fly, not the men, that is, 
all their teaching, their sermons and words are carnal. 
They are two women, as two cherubim are, because the 
word takes its place between the one who speaks and 
the one who hears, just as Christ always sent two to 
preach. The sum of all this is that the misery and 
misfortune of the Jews is so great that they are not only 
kept locked up in the ephah, so that they cannot escape, 
but also that they will never hear the pure word. Godless 
teachers must be brought together to hold back the 
people so that they never hear the right word, who are 
locked in the highest ungodliness, as the Lord also 
threatens in Isaiah [Cap. 5, 6.]: "I will command my 
clouds not to rain on them" 2c. He describes in a 
terrifying way the fall of this people, which is so 
desperate that even no part of the restoration is left; they 
shall be rejected forever, never be converted, so that 
they will not be saved. For it indicates that their doctrine 
touches neither heaven nor earth, that is, that they 
neither teach nor comprehend the kingdom of God nor 
that of the world, that they no longer have either the 
spiritual or the corporal kingdom, that the twofold reign 
has perished, that is, the spiritual of Joshua the priest 
and the corporal or temporal of Zerubbabel the prince; 
in short, that they both teach and comprehend the 
kingdom of God and the kingdom of the world.

have lost the kingdom as well as the priesthood. 
Although the Jews see and know this, they cannot 
recognize their error because they are so miserably 
blinded. Thus they allow themselves to be carried high 
between heaven and earth; their stubbornness makes 
them insurmountable. 


That a house may be built for him in the land of 
Sinear. 


He does not consider it worthy to attach the new name 
to it, but keeps the old one. For he does not say: in 
Babylon, but: "in Sinear". There, he says, it will be built 
and prepared. Here the question arises as to the place, 
for it is in the comparison of the two places that one must 
not imagine a certain physical place. The opinion is 
recently this: The people who are now in the twofold 
regime, the spiritual and the temporal, who have been 
brought back from Babylon, will also finally be led into 
the true Jerusalem. But the others who are lost will not 
only not remain in Jerusalem, but will even go away to 
Babylon. 





will be led to spiritual (mysticam) Babylon, that is, to a 
disgraced place, to the greatest blindness, to a place 
where there is wrath, judgment and vengeance of God, 
no peace, no grace, no mercy, no Jerusalem. All this 
follows them wherever they may be. 


And prepared (Et dimittatur ibi). 


And there it shall be left. This is the most lamentable 
and frightening thing, that this error cannot be repaired, 
that this rejection lasts forever, just as everywhere in the 
Scriptures the threats of the Lord are quite frightening 
[Hos. 1:6]: "I will no longer have mercy on them", 
likewise [Hos. 4:6]: "I will forget forever", as one can see 
everywhere in the prophets. So they are let go, and "are 
set on the ground," that is, on their hardness, obstinacy 
and godless stubbornness, that there is no hope to set 
them right again; they are cut out of the tree, as the 
apostle says in the letter to the Romans [Cap. 11, 8.ff.] 
2c. 


The sixth chapter. 


This chapter is dark in itself, and the various opinions of 
the commentators darken it even more. Therefore, | am 
also somewhat in doubt about the correct interpretation, 
but | believe that | will not interpret it badly. It would lead 
too far, however, if | wanted to cite and refute all the 
opinions of each individual. But with great agreement 
they want this, that by the four chariots four empires are 
meant, namely the Babylonian, the Persian, the Greek 
and the Roman, of which many things are said in Daniel. 
How this does not fit at all, my refutation alone will show 
clearly. And it is this: This is absolutely the manner of 
this prophet, that in all his visions he deals with future 
things, not with what has been done or has happened, 
which is learned from all the previous visions. 


and from those who follow. This would not agree with 
the interpretation of those who interpret it from the four 
kingdoms. Because at the first chariot they must come 
back to the Babylonian empire, which is not right with 
the way of the prophet. Moreover, their spiritual 
interpretation cannot be approved, because it is very 
ridiculous and cold, since they interpret the red horses 
of the first chariot as the martyrs, the white horses as 
the virgins, the black ones as the confessors, the 
checkered ones as the diversity of all the saints, and | 
do not know what other exceedingly ridiculous things. 
For this must be kept in mind with every spiritual 
interpretation, that it must be in accordance with the 
faith, that is, that it refers to the faith or to the office of 
the Word. Spiritual interpretations are nothing at all that 
are based on works. 


2048 L. XXVIII, 82-84. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 6, 1. 


Since there is no respect for works, they are all external 
creatures, youthfulness, hand and foot. This is to be 
noted, lest we be deceived by the example of those who, 
out of pleasure in works, put forth such inconsistent 
things, inventing | know not what paltry and inconsistent 
things 2c. 

In this chapter we will present what the Lord has 
given. The judgment stands with you, and if there is 
anyone whom we do not satisfy, and he has better, let 
him tell us; but | believe that | shall hit the mark. 

In sum, the prophet does in this chapter what he did 
in all the previous chapters, namely, that he comforts 
and encourages the people, who were afraid and 
depressed by the terror of the nations at midnight. For 
above | have reminded several times that the 
neighboring nations resisted that the Jews should not 
promote the begun temple, which they were 
commanded to rebuild by God's commandment. For 
they feared the power and the weapons of the nations 
against Midnight, by whom they had previously been 
captured and miserably afflicted. They were still mindful 
of this calamity and were afraid, instructed by what they 
had suffered before. Therefore, this memory of the past 
misfortune always deterred them, fearing that they would 
have to suffer a similar or even more severe misfortune. 
Therefore, they still considered the midnight region 
suspicious, since Jeremiah had predicted that all 
misfortune would come from there. Against this timidity 
or fear of the midnight region, the prophet consoles them 
here that they should compose themselves and 
remember the words of the Lord: everything will be safe; 
the midnight and that part to be feared will not only not 
oppose them, but will even give its consent and keep 
faith and believe the word. And so the prophet wills that 
all cause for fear be taken away. This is my opinion and 
my summary of this chapter. For everything will be 
intended to be related in such a way to the ministry of 
the Word, and so this chapter will be in the best possible 
way with the 


2049 


the preceding ones together. In the previous chapter we 
saw the vision of the flying book, of the ephah, of the 
centner of lead, of the flying women 2c. By this vision is 
indicated the godless Pharisaic doctrine that would 
prevail when the time of Christ's coming was at hand. In 
this chapter, he indicates what will happen after Christ is 
already revealed and reigns, namely, that a new light will 
be kindled, that is, the evangelical doctrine, which will 
not only drive out the godless doctrine, but will also be 
spread over the whole world and bear fruit among all 
nations. And so, as | have said, this chapter follows in 
proper order from the previous one, which we have 
finished. Now let us proceed to the text. 


V. 1. And | lifted up mine eyes again, and saw. 


Since he says [in the Vulgate: Et conversus sum] 
that he has turned back, he indicates that the thing 
according to him will happen in the future, has not yet 
happened, as he also says in the previous chapter [v. 1] 
that he turned back when he saw the flying book. And 
this is what | reminded at the beginning, that what those 
interpret of the four kingdoms does not fit, since the 
prophet indicates that he speaks of a future thing that 
has not yet happened. 


[There were four chariots coming out from between 
two mountains; but those mountains were of brass]. 


Et montes montes aerei is a Hebrew way of 
speaking that the Latin expresses simply this way: in the 
middle of two brazen mountains. - "Four chariots." The 
face in a previous chapter, namely in the first, also had 
horses. Here, however, not only horses but also chariots 
are presented to us, so that it is clearly indicated that this 
is a different vision from the previous one, since the 
horses are scattered in the four regions of the world, and 
make the Spirit of the Lord rest in the whole world [v. 8], 
so that the vision cannot be understood in any other way 
than from the office of the word. 


2050 L. XXVIII, 84-87. Interpretations On the Prophets. 


2051 





V. 2. red horses. 


These are "the red foxes". Varii are "colorful, blotchy, 
explosive". Such are the horses we call "gray horses," 
which have many spots. The same word is in the first 
book of Moses [Cap. 30, 39.], where Jacob peeled the 
sticks and put them in the place where the sheep were 
watered, and received "sprenglichte" 2c. by mating. 


V. 5. 1) They are the four winds under heaven. 


This is the interpretation of the face, but quite dark. It 
is necessary, however, that we support our 
interpretation, which we have established above, so that 
everything does not seem to be contrary to each other. 
The chariots are called XX, that is spirit (spiritus). For so 
we want to translate it in this place, not by the word 
"wind", although the Hebrew expression denotes both. 


Who come forth to stand before the ruler of all 
lands. 


In the previous vision the horsemen returned with the 
horses, here they do not return, but are sent forth: from 
standing before the ruler of all lands (for so it is called in 
Hebrew), for the word of GOD always runs, it is not idle. 
For thus the Scripture makes the angels servants of 
GOD, who stand with him, as it is said in Daniel [Cap. 7, 
10.], "A thousand times a thousand served him," that is, 
stood with him. In this passage he speaks of the 
ministering and standing of the angels. The Sophists 
struggled miserably with the interpretation of this 
passage, and especially Dionysius invented ridiculous 
dreams about the heavenly kingdom. But since he calls 
here the ruler of the earth, he understands Christ, who is 
actually called the ruler of the earth in the Psalms, as in 
the 8th Psalm, v. 1: "Lord, our ruler" 2c., and above in 
this prophet we have seen the same. Everything in the 
vision must be carefully observed. The red horses, which 
are on the first chariot, are completely silent. The black 
and the 


1) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 





white at the second and third chariot are sent toward 
midnight, so that it is clear, as | reminded above, that it 
cannot be understood of the four kingdoms. For they do 
not come from midnight, but from Jerusalem, and go in 
view of the prophet toward midnight. The fourth chariot 
with the checkered steeds goes out about noon. In the 
Hebrew it is connected in such a way: "the checkered 
strong steeds". They are the same horses, and yet he 
speaks of them as different. 


v. 8. And he called to me, and talked with me. 


In the Hebrew there is a great emphasis in the word, 
"And he called unto me." In this passage is the summa 
and the main part (epi- tasis) of the whole chapter. And 
up to here goes the first part of this chapter, which we 
want to explain as much as we can. 

Above | have reminded several times that by the four 
number the four directions of the earth circle, that is the 
world, are designated. It is therefore indicated that the 
horses with the chariots are to be sent out into the four 
corners of the world. He is silent about the red steeds of 
the first chariot, therefore we will also be silent. Those 
on the second chariot will be sent out around midnight, 
as will those on the third. This serves to comfort the 
people, as if to say: You are afraid of the midnight region, 
but take courage and let go of mourning and fear; the 
Lord will wage war against it. He will fight for you against 
the midnight, because he has sent two chariots. Since it 
was preached by the prophet, the Jews may not have 
understood what it was referring to, but yet the comfort 
is held out to them so that they may be uplifted and 
encouraged, so that they may cease to tremble and fear, 
and think that the Lord is concerned for them in every 
way, that those whom they feared most may be 
subdued, since two chariots have been sent against 
them. So we see that what | have reminded you is 
completely true, that this chapter has to do with the 
people being encouraged and strengthened against the 
fear of the enemies at midnight. 

Secret interpretation: If we take the color of the 
steeds according to the secret interpretation, then 


2052 D- XXVIII, 87-89. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 6, 8. 


everything will also be based on the ministry of the 
gospel, to which everything must be related, not on the 
foolish delusion and the ridiculous little fibs of the works. 
First, there are "two mountains," which signify the twofold 
church of the Jews and Gentiles, which he made One, as 
Paul says [Eph. 2:14.], "He made the two One." But they 
are called mountains, because everywhere in Scripture a 
mountain signifies a multitude or collection of people, and 
the power of kingdoms, as he said above [Cap. 4, 7.], 
"Who art thou, O great mountain, before Zerubbabel?" 
Isaiah also calls the church a mountain, Cap. 2, 2. "It shall 
be certain at the last time the mountain where the Lord's 
house is," 2c., that is, by the power of the word the church 
of Christ shall be exalted and made glorious, for he 
speaks of spiritual exaltation and glorification. "But 
"brazen" are the mountains, because the church is 
invincible against all the violence and attempts of Satan, 
the gates of hell and the world. It is not warlike or 
bloodthirsty, and let no one think that it is to be referred 
to that, but ore signifies the unconquerable perseverance 
and endurance of the church, as it is also said in Micah 
[Cap. 4:13.], "I will make thee brazen claws." Now it 
remains that we also interpret the colors of the steeds. 
He is silent about the "red steeds" of the first chariot. In 
short, we want to take the colors on the horses for the 
effect they have had on the peoples to whom they are 
sent. The red color means the effect of the gospel among 
the unbelieving and carnal Jews, i.e. the gospel only 
brought about a carnal godlessness among them, only 
aroused a bitter hatred against the gospel of Christ and 
the preachers of the gospel, because only a few and 
hardly a remnant were preserved. Thus, the first ministry 
of the Gospel in the Jewish land did nothing. They only 
became more carnal, so that they became more 
bloodthirsty and raged against the saints. The "black" 
and the "white" horses are others on the second and third 
chariots. The black and the white color are the extreme 
(extremi) colors, say the philosophers. Red is the middle 
color, because it originates from Na 





2053 


tur from the white and the black when the white is 
combined with the blackness. This can be seen in coal 
when it is lit, and in saltpeter (in vitro) 1) 2c. In short, the 
black color is the color of darkness and death, the white 
is the color of light and life. It is the word that first makes 
guilty and condemns and kills, then makes the killed 
righteous and blessed 2c. The "checkmates" are the 
apostle Paul and other ministers of the gospel, who 
preached the gospel to different and very distant peoples. 
They are also very strong, because the apostle Paul 
worked more in the ministry of the word than all other 
apostles, which he himself testifies [1 Cor. 5:10]. He has 
taken on many colors, making himself available to many 
different peoples. These are ready to move everywhere, 
that is, Paul with his own came among wild and strong 
peoples, to the Romans. Therefore, it was necessary that 
the strongest preachers were sent there, who taught the 
word of the gospel with great confidence of heart and with 
great power 2c. 


Behold, moving towards midnight. 


He applies the face according to which they understood 
and were minded at that time. Since they could not 
understand the darkness that we have just explained at 
that time, the prophet only deals with the fact that the 
fearful hearts would like to be strengthened, so that they 
would no longer be anxious because of the midnight 
region. 


[Make my spirit rest in the land around midnight.] 


"My spirit" is the Holy Spirit, not anger or revenge, as 
some interpret it. The same expression is Isa. 11, 2: "On 
him shall rest the Spirit of the Lord." So here: "They make 
my spirit to rest in the land toward the north,” that is, he 
will rule there by the Word and the Holy Spirit. But it will 
rest on the mid-

2054 L. xxvm, 89-91. interpretations On the Prophets. 


The prophet applied the face at night, as | have said, 
because the prophet was appealing to your 
understanding of the listeners, because they did not fear 
all the other peoples of the earth as they did those at 
midnight. Therefore he says of the midnight alone, while 
it is true of the whole earth; but it was necessary that it 
should be referred to it alone, because of the fear of 
consciences. For the proclaimers of the word must act 
in such a way that they direct the word where they see 
the consciences suffer most, to the part where they see 
them most terrified. 


V. 10. Take from the captives, namely from Heldai 
2c. 


The visions of this prophet are now finished, in which 
there was a great difficulty, and for this reason he was 
considered to be the most obscure because of the ‘dark’ 
visions. Here at the end he adds a sign to confirm all the 
previous visions and sermons he has preached so far. 
For this is the way in all prophets and everywhere in the 
Scriptures, that some sign is added to the word, by 
which it is confirmed. Thus Isaiah Cap. 20, 2. that he 
should go naked and barefoot, that he should take off 
his sackcloth from his loins and remove his shoes from 
his feet. By this sign he confirmed the preaching that 
Egypt should be laid waste and stripped bare (for this he 
had prophesied) by the king of Assyria. Such signs are 
also many in Jeremiah, as in the thirteenth chapter [w. 
1-7.] of the belt that was hidden and rotted. By this sign 
the Lord wanted to confirm the rejection of the people of 
Israel, who had fallen away from the right service and 
the right word through ungodliness; therefore they would 
perish 2c. This is also the sign in the same prophet, 
when he is given the cup of the Lord's wrath to pour out 
to the nations [Cap. 25, 15]. Likewise, when he wore a 
wooden yoke on his neck [Cap. 27:2] to indicate that all 
nations would be subjected to the power of the king of 
the Chaldeans, all would come under his power. Thus 
signs are always added to the word at all times. Noah 
had

the rainbow [Gen. 9:13], 1) we have baptism and the 
Lord's Supper. The same happens here also in this 
prophet. 

Accipe a transmigratione, that is, take from the 
captives who have returned from the Babylonian 
captivity. Those he names here, Heldai, Tobiah and 
Jedaiah, with whom he is commanded to go to the house 
of Josiah, who will be the fourth companion. For all four 
of these had been captives in Babylon and had been 
brought back. There is no dispute about the persons. 
Two are named in Ezra, and there is no doubt that 
Jedaiah was of the house of Joshua, and Tobiah of the 
tribe of Zerubbabel. The other two are not called by 
these names in Ezra, and it is not to be wondered at, 
since many often have two names and three names. It 
is probable that these four were from the two tribes of 
Judah and Levi, because in sum, the purpose of these 
signs is to make Christ both priest and king, as the words 
are abundantly clear. Significantly he added: "Of the 
captives," that is, those who came from Babylon, so that 
those who had returned from captivity might be 
strengthened the more and believe, and the others also 
might not doubt after they had seen the sign. 


V. 11. But take silver and gold. 


Namely, the sacred gold and silver offered for use in 
the temple and for the sacred utensils. 


And make crowns. 


He would not sin who added "two" here, so that one 
would read: Make two crowns. 


And set it on the head of Joshua. 


He does not want the crown to be placed on the head 
of Josiah or Heldai, but on that of Joshua the priest. And 
herein lies the meaning and intent of the sign that the 
high priest is adorned with the twofold crown. To this 
sign is added the word:

V. 12. Behold, there is a man called Zemah 
(crescens), for under him it shall grow. 


For | translate in such a way after the Hebrew, as also 
exactly the same place is treated above quite plentifully 
by me in the third chapter [V. 8.], where also the same 
word is. The evangelist Lucas seems to have seen here, 
since he says [Luc. 1, 78.]: "The exit from on high has 
visited us", where he used the word. But it is more 
significant if we translate it by the word crescere [to 
grow]. And it is the opinion of this passage, as if to say, 
Hitherto have | comforted you with many sermons and 
visions, that ye might know assuredly that the temple 
should be rebuilt, and that ye should be preserved, 
among whom the future kingdom of Christ should be 
established. Therefore do not be afraid; no one will be 
able to overcome you and prevent the building from being 
done, for everything must be done for the sake of the 
coming Christ. When he comes, he will take upon himself 
the kingdom and the priesthood at the same time, and he 
will grow very much and a great growth will take place 
under him, that is, the gospel will prosper against the 
gates of hell, against the power and attacks of Satan and 
the whole world. Christ will show himself strong against 
all the wisdom, righteousness, prudence and strength of 
the world, as we have abundantly interpreted above in 
the third chapter. And so it becomes clear that this text is 
not to be referred to the priest Joshua, who is only a 
model and sign of this future man of whom he speaks, 
the growing one, namely Christ, as what follows will also 
clearly show, since it is described that he will sit on his 
throne, which did not belong to a priest. For the kingdom 
and the dominion stood alone with the tribe of Judah, not 
with Levi. Therefore, since he says here that both will be 
united in one person, this must be understood by Christ, 
who is both our king and our priest forever, as the 
Scriptures teach. 


V. 13.r) He will wear the ornament (gloriam). 


1) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 


2057 


These are peculiar words in the Hebrew language, 
which we, since we do not have a perfect knowledge of 
this language, cannot render with appropriate and fitting 
words. But gloria means praise and glory, as is clear 
from the verse that we often find in many psalms: With 
honor and adornment thou art arrayed [Ps. 104, 1. f. 8, 
6. 21, 6.], that is, with praise and beautiful adornment, 
"a delectable, comely ornament,” as is the dainty and 
appropriate adornment of girls when they adorn 
themselves with bracelets, showpieces, gold and silver 
collars, and every kind of ornament. This is what the 
Latins call ornatum [adornment] or decorem 
[adornment], and the Hebrews laudem (praise). Clear 
is the text in the second book of Moses [Cap. 28, 2.]: 
"clothes that are glorious and beautiful" (in laudem et 
gloriam). Therefore, one can see here that adornment 
and adornment or the exceedingly great prize of the 
kingdom of Christ. As Christ's kingdom is not bodily, 
neither can he be adorned with bodily adornment. But it 
has no other adornment than the preaching of the word 
of the gospel, which is the adornment and supreme 
praise of Christ. The kings of the world are clothed in 
purple, are dressed and adorned with gold and precious 
stones. But Christ puts on the light; His liness, 
loveliness, righteousness, holiness, and goodness are 
preached through the gospel. When it is preached that 
he is full of grace and truth, then he is adorned with his 
highest adornment and his most glorious honor. In this 
priesthood and kingdom there is nothing external, as it 
was in the Mosaic priesthood. Here, however, 
everything is spiritual, as is also evident from the 
exceedingly beautiful verse of the Psalm [Ps. 145, 5.]:"l 
will speak of your glorious splendor, and of your 
wonders", where the prophet explains to himself what 
he called "the glorious splendor". So is the same way of 
speaking in the fourth book of Moses 2) [Cap. 27, 20.]: 
"Put your glory on Joshua", that is, adorn him, praise 
and extol him before the people. So.is GOD also 
adorned when we preach Him through the Word and 
faith. And so the earth becomes full of the glory of the 
majesty of the Lord.

And will sit. 


Namely, as a teacher. This is the second adornment 
of Christ. 


And will rule. 


Namely, as a king. This is the third ornament 
Likewise: 


Will also be priest on his throne. 


He will be both king and priest. Thus, the offices a 
these two tribes will be united in this one person, whic 
never happened before and was not allowed. For this was 
the prophecy [Gen. 49, 10], that the scepter of Judah shal 
not be taken away, until the consolation of all the nations 
comes (desideratus) [Hagg.2, 8]. Namely, Christ is both 
our king and priest. King, in that he rules over us 
preserves and protects us against all power and violence 
of the enemies, both physical and spiritual, so that is 
creature can hurt us without his will. He is a priest - an 
this is by far the sweetest and most comforting thing fo 
the conscience - in that he represents us to the Father. 
and bears all our iniquities as if they were his. In order ta 
make us joint heirs of all the Father's goods, he reconcile 
us to the Father, so that the Father can no more be he 
with us or reject us than he can Christ himself, his Son 
whom he willed to be our High Priest 2c. 


And there will be peace between the two. 


Some interpret this from the union (unitate) of the 
Jews and Gentiles, as Paul says in the letter to the 
Ephesians [Cap. 2, 14.]:""He has made both one, and has 
broken down the fence", that is, the law that separated the 
Jews from the Gentiles, since they wanted to be 
considered more worthy and better than the Gentiles 
because of the law received from God, by which they 
thought they were justified, and that the Gentiles had ta 
be condemned because they did not have the law. This 
fence, says the apostle, Christ broke down and nailed t 
the cross, so that both the Jews and the Gentiles woul 
know that they should be saved by faith alone, without any, 
works. This 





Opinion is not bad in itself, but | would still, if | did not 
dare too much, approve another, which would please me 
more, namely, that the prophet speaks of the union and 
unity of the two offices of the kingdom and the 
priesthood, that there were both at the same time in 
Christ, so that it becomes completely clear that this could 
in no way be understood by the priest Joshua, as some 
think, since the kingdom belonged to the tribe of Judah 
alone, not to Levi, whose priesthood was 2c. For this is 
also the meaning of the double crowns, that is, the 
twofold regency, the physical and the spiritual, to which 
a priest of the law could not be placed. These crowns 
also show what kind of kingdom it is, since one is of gold 
and the other of silver. The gold signifies faith, but the 
silver signifies the service of the Word, which is evident 
from many scriptural passages. Thus Solomon says in 
Proverbs [Cap. 10, 20.], "The tongue of the righteous is 
precious silver," and in Psalm [Ps. 12, 7.] it is said, "The 
speech of the LORD is pure, as silver in an earthen 
crucible is sevenfold. "2c. Faith is the only payment that 
the dear God demands from us. 


V.14. And the crowns shall be for the memorial of 
Helem, and of Tobiah, and of Jedaiah, and of Hen the 
son of Zephaniah, in the temple of the LORD. 


This is something very common in the Hebrew 
language, that some have two names, some also three 
names, whereby for the readers sometimes darkness 
arises, since the names are changed elsewhere, as also 
here the names of two are changed, namely the first and 
the fourth. But the Lord commands that those crowns are 
to be hung up in memory of this thing, as also with us 
weapons and insignia of some people are hung up in 
churches or public buildings (theatris), so that the 
descendants are reminded. The same thing the Lord 
willed here, and that the names of those four should be 
written to them, so that the people would not doubt that 
what those signs had promised would be fulfilled. Thus, 
those crowns continued as seals of God's promise until 
Christ came. 


2060 L. xxvm, 96 f. Interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 6, 15, 


v. 15. And shall come from afar, which shall build 
the temple of the LORD. 


This is what some say about the kings and rulers of 
the richest nations, all of whom, moved by the glorious 
fame, sent to Jerusalem gold, silver and precious gifts of 
all kinds for the use of the temple. For the ornaments of 
the temple were very rich and shining, so that even the 
apostles of Christ were astonished at the ban of the 
temple, as is written in the Gospel [Marc. 13, 1.]. But | 
hold fast to the context and the order of the text. For the 
prophet speaks of Christ, the growing one, who would 
establish a new kingdom and at the same time also a 
new priesthood, and for this many would come from 
distant lands, that is, all peoples from all parts of the 
world would gather to him, as the Scripture says 
everywhere, so that that true temple would be 
completed, out of which he would be praised and 
preached, that is, by the faithful, both Jews and Gentiles. 
2c. 


If you will obey the voice of the Lord your God. 


Explicitly he adds this to the great terror of the Jews. For 
he indicates the fall and the miserable ruin of this people, 
as he also prophesied above quite frighteningly 





2061 


in the fifth chapter. And Isaiah emphasizes _ this 
everywhere as if he wanted to say: This will indeed 
happen what | have now prophesied, but see to it that 
you do not despise the word of God. By the voice of the 
Lord this building will be erected, he will only use the 
voice for this so glorious and splendid thing, by the office 
of the word he will accomplish everything. Therefore, if 
you also want to be in this temple, you must believe the 
word, you must accept the word without seeking 
outward splendor and splendor 2c. 


Thus we have finished everything that is very difficult 
in this prophet. And certainly we can hardly with great 
effort set our minds right again from the unrhymed 
interpretations of the teachers, which everywhere cause 
us more trouble than the right understanding of the 
prophet, so extraordinarily do they diverge and confuse 
everything, especially Jerome. "He may hardly put a 
good saying in a whole prophet." Therefore, it is very 
important for us to wriggle out of the interpretations of all 
these people as if out of an inextricable 1) labyrinth. 


1) Instead of ititrieadili we have assumed inextrieabili. 


The seventh chapter. 


The following two chapters are in themselves quite clear 
and easy, now that the difficulties of the visions are over. 
With the exposition of what is contained in the first six 
chapters, the prophet has spent almost two years, what 
the inscription in the beginning and in this seventh 
chapter indicates. He had begun in the second year of 
King Darin, and here it is said that he began in the fourth 
year. Thus he preached to the people for two years 
before he began this sermon. The sum of the two 
chapters is this: After instructing the people and again 


When the people were brought back to the right and 
good way, so that they walked in the law and the word 
of the Lord, Satan or the godless human reason began 
to invent the way of the statutes of men and the little 
human fiefdoms, which are without and beyond the word 
of God. For this is how Satan tends to intrude 
everywhere into that which belongs to God and the 
service of God, as the Germans finely say in a proverb: 
"Our Lord God has nowhere a church, Tenfel also wants 
to have a chapel next to it. Thus, among this people, it 
was inevitable that 


2062 L. xxvni, 97-iov. Interpretations on the prophets. 


2063 





The whole of the fifth chapter above has described this 
in a terrifying way [in the vision of the flying book]. For 
this reason the Lord allows this to happen while the 
prophet is still alive, so that they, reminded by this 
example, will not fall away from the word, but will stick to 
the pure and clear word. But in the whole Old Testament 
there is hardly such a clear and distinct passage against 
the statutes of men and the spirituality of angels [Col. 2, 
18.], which, because of the hypocrisy, even seems 
exceedingly holy according to the judgment of reason, 
as it is in this chapter, as we shall see. And yet the 
blindness of the papists, the blind and deprived of all 
common sense, is such that they bring [this passage] 1) 
forward for their statutes. For this passage of the fasts is 
famous in the church of the pope; moved by the same, 
they also instituted the quarterly fasts. So great is the 
blindness of human reason, which so brazenly misuses 
the word of God according to its will. It seizes only a few 
words, but sets aside the whole order and the context of 
the speech. Thus, because of the mention of fasting, 
they immediately seized this word stubbornly, thinking 
that what they dream could be established from it, while 
these fasts have no price in the Scriptures. They were 
self-chosen works of this people and self-chosen 
spirituality, as the apostle Paul speaks [Col. 2, 23], and 
as it is completely condemned here by the Lord. 

But the reason for these fasts is not given in the text, 
and there was nothing in it to add the reason for this void 
thing. For who could give tenable reasons for all the 
exceedingly foolish statutes? Satan devises a thousand 
arts by which to deceive the unwary into believing that 
what they do at his instigation is worship. If, therefore, 
reasons are to be added at all, we shall be content with 
those which the Jews put forward, which Jerome has 
abundantly noted. Whether they are true or not, we will 
not endure. 


1) Added by us. 


For "the fast of the fourth month" [Cap. 8, 19.] they 
indicate this reason, that in this month Jerusalem was 
first besieged by the king of the Babylonians, and that he, 
after the walls had been thrown down, broke into the city. 
He took it only after the king fled, and so the city fell into 
the hands of the enemy. In memory of this, so that they 
might testify that they mourned the disaster of the holy 
city, it seemed good to them that a fast should be 
sanctified and a mourning observed, which they did not 
observe otherwise than when they had received a 
commandment from God. Quite similar to these are 
some superstitious people in our times, who, in a foolish 
spirituality (religione), abstain from all food on the day of 
mourning, after the wooden Christ is buried, until this 
wooden Christ is brought out again, and they do this in 
honor of the suffering of Christ, neglecting in the 
meantime the proper custom of suffering. Such was also 
the superstition of the Jews, since they fasted annually in 
the fourth month because of the capture of Jerusalem. 
The fourth month, however, is with them, that | also note 
this, the June. Because they begin the counting of the 
months with March 2c. 

"The fasting of the fifth month" is that they also fasted in 
the fifth month. For these fasts they give this reason: that 
afterwards, when the city was taken, the temple of the 
Lord and the palaces were set on fire, for this is reported 
in the sacred histories. Therefore, moved by such great 
misfortune, namely that the king of the Babylonians was 
not satisfied with having plundered and laid waste the 
city, but also destroyed the temple of the Lord and raged 
with fire against all the best houses of the rulers, they 
also set a fast. 

"The Fast of the Seventh Moon." This month is 
September. 2) For the establishment of these fasts they 
have given this, that in this month Gedaliah was killed, 
whom the king of the Babylonians 3) had set over the 
land of Canaan, that he should rule there.

was to lead them to the kingdom of Babylon. One reads 
about this in Jeremiah [Cap. 39-44], where he scolds 
that they fled to Egypt out of fear of the king of Babylon. 
Because this murder of Gedaliah became afterwards the 
cause of great misfortune. 

"The fasts of the tenth month," that is, in December. 
They say that they were induced to start these fasts by 
the fact that in this month the rumor of the burning of the 
temple and the flight to Egypt first reached those who 
had been carried away captive to Babylon 2c. 

And in these things stands the summa of these two 
chapters, the seventh and the eighth. For the Lord 
condemns these self-chosen righteousnesses, saying 
that they are displeasing to him because they were not 
instituted and commanded by him. This passage, as | 
reminded you in the beginning, is certainly exceedingly 
clear against the statutes of men and the self-chosen 
works, however good they may seem to be. For who can 
deny that fasting is a good work? And yet the Lord 
rejects it here. But he demands that they be godly and 
devout in heart, and that they practice the word of God, 
that they do the works commanded by God. There is no 
need for self-chosen works and self-chosen spirituality 
(E&eAO*onoxeias), as Paul calls them, 
invent for it.

V. 2. When Sarezer and Regemmelech and their 
people sent to the house of God. 


Jerome was very much mistaken here, since he 
translated the word that is in Hebrew, BethEl: to the 
house of GOD. It is the proper name of the place, 
therefore it should not have been _ translated 
appellatively. For where the Scripture calls the temple of 
the LORD, it makes use of other words, namely XXX 
XXXX, and | know nowhere in the 
Scripture a place where BethEl should be translated 
appellatively. Therefore read like this: And they sent to 
BethEl, as if he wanted to say: They should be ashamed 
of their ungodliness, who still hang in that damned place, 
because of which they were miserably afflicted. But 
Sarezer and RegemMelech 3) were sent to plead before 
the Lord, with gifts and freewill offerings, such as are 
often sent in recompense. Finally, after the sacrifice is 
performed and the gift is offered in BethEl, which is the 
greatest impiety, for the LORD had rejected and 
forbidden that place, they also send to the priests of the 
LORD's house in Jerusalem and to the prophet to 
inquire. 


V. 3. 4) Must | also weep? 


Thus one must read according to the Hebrew: Will | 
still weep in the fifth month to sanctify myself, as | have 
done for many years? About the vow (de religione) of 
the Nazarites, see the fourth book of Moses [Cap. 6, 2. 
ff.], how they abstained, did not shave their heads, and | 
do not know what other things they observed, as also 
the apostle Paul did because of the weakness of the 
Jews, as can be seen in the Acts of the Apostles [Cap. 
21, 24.]. This custom is alluded to here in this question 
put to the priests and prophets of the Lord, as if to say, 
"Must | then mourn and abstain from wine, and be 
superstitious, as it were, according to the customs of the 
Nazarites, in remembrance, namely, of the calamity that 
followed the destruction of the city and the burning of the 
temple 2c."? It asks

So about the already rebuilt temple, whether he should 
continue in this self-chosen clergy, as also some weak 
still raise questions at distant times, because of their 
ridiculous vows 2c. 


V. 5: When you fasted and suffered. 


The Lord rebukes that foolish superstition, as if to 
say: | do not care about your not eating or eating. What 
is it to me, since | did not command you? It was none of 
my business that you should go mourning, suffering and 
starving because of the burning of the temple and the 
taking of the city, while in the meantime you change your 
lives to nothing, not ceasing to be idolaters, despisers of 
the word of God and suspicious of me, not exercising 
love either, as will be added here of the unjust judgment, 
of the injustice to widows and orphans. Quite similar is 
the passage in Malachi [Cap. 3, 1-4.], "It is in vain to 
serve GOD, and what profit is it to us to live hard lives?" 
2c. In sum, the Lord says here that it is not fasted to him, 
that everything is in vain, since he has not commanded 
it. But he calls good the works that come from a good 
root, from a believing heart. For if the heart is sanctified 
and pure, then every work is also pure and holy, whether 
one fasts or eats, wakes or sleeps 2c. 


V. 6. or when you ate and watered 2c. 


A similar passage is in Jeremiah [Cap. 7:21], "Thou 
shalt offer your burnt offerings and other sacrifices unto 
heaps, and eat flesh. "2c. "Let me have peace with your 
eating and drinking" and with your fasting. [Ps. 50, 13.:] 
"Do you mean that | will eat the flesh of oxen, or drink 
the blood of goats?" [Ps. 50:12:] "If | hungered, | would 
not tell thee of it. "2c. That is, | care neither for your 
fasting nor for your eating, as Paul also says [1 Cor. 8:8:] 
"If we eat, we shall not be better for it; if we eat not, we 
shall not be less for it." 1) The food makes

We are not pleased with God, but when the heart is 
cleansed, God is pleased with everything, and he does 
not care what is done, everything is pleasing to him, it is 
only external things. If you eat or fast, if you drink or 
sleep, what does God care? He wants the heart to be 
godly and pure. Therefore, Paul did well when he 
circumcised himself at the same time as the rest of the 
Jews, as it is written in the Acts of the Apostles [Cap. 21, 
24]. 


V. 7. Is this not what the Lord preached? 2c. 

| read thus: Are not these the words which the Lord 
preached by the former prophets, when Jerusalem 
stood? 2c. Namely these words: You have fasted, you 
have walked sadly, you have caused self-chosen 
spirituality 2c. All this | do not want, | do not approve. By 
all these things you have only provoked me to anger, and 
yet you still do not desist, since you have been taught 
before even by experience and your great misfortune 
how much | hate and detest your presumption and your 
self-chosen works. How long then do you abuse my long- 
suffering, how long do you continue to be ungodly? For 
the hypocrites sin in two ways, namely, that they forsake 
God and invent something completely different from 
God's word; then, that they blasoheme the name of God 
by attaching to their deeds and their actions the delusion 
that they thereby attain righteousness, and think that it is 
a service of God and is approved by God, and thus call 
evil good and good evil, as it is said in Isaiah [Cap.5, 20], 
which public sinners and those who live in public shame 
do not do. 


V. 9. 2) Thus says the LORD of hosts. 
"For thus had the LORD of hosts said." This is how | 
would like it to be translated, so that it fits in with what 
has gone before. For he interprets himself, what words 
they had heard before from the prophets, since he adds: 


Judges right. 
As if to say: My prophets did not speak like this: Fast, 
lament, mourn;

absolutely nothing of these things, but rather so: "Judge 
rightly" 2c. Hasn't enough nonsensical action been done 
yet? Do you still want to continue? Hear what the Lord 
says, what he demands of you, namely, that you should 
have righteous rulers, princes and judges, who govern 
the community rightly, who are concerned about justice, 
who give justice in a right way without regard to the 
person, so that they do not, bribed by gifts, pervert justice 
and oppress the poor. Namely, this is the first sin, that 
they have kings who are hungry for gifts (BaolAéac 
Owpopayous.) ') 

Then the Lord also requires this of each one, that he 
have mercy and compassion on his neighbor. This is the 
duty of love, which concerns all equally, as Christ also 
says [Matth. 9, 13.]: "| am pleased with mercy and not 
with sacrifice." Now mercy is a kindness by which we do 
good to others, as if to say, "Do good to one another," 
and stand by one another through love; then also show 
mercy to one another, that is, each one should be kind to 
his brother, have mercy on his neighbor in every need, 
forgive one another's offenses, and receive one another 
if you have fallen 2c. Then do not do injustice to the 
stranger, the widow, the orphan and the poor, who are 
otherwise deprived of all help. They are already 
miserable in themselves, so do not add one evil to 
another, for otherwise the poor will be in misery 
everywhere 2) 2c. 


V. 11. 12. But they would not pay attention. 


That is to say, intent on their own self-interest, on their 
own lusts, they turned their ears away from the truth "and 
set their hearts like a demant". | do not know if the 
Hebrew word means a demant, because | have often 
remembered that the Hebrew grammarians are uncertain 
in the words that mean things. In the second book of 
Moses [Cap. 28, 18.] we have translated by the word 
demant, 


1) The Erlanger has in the margin: He alludes to the words of 
Hesiod. Cf. k/"/" E V. 38 8(4. 
2) The Erlanger has in the margin: He alludes to Ovia. last. 1, 218: 
kauxsr sackt. 





but there is another word. But it means the godless 
Pharisaic stubbornness that reigned in their hearts that 
they did not give ear to the word of God. 


Which the LORD of hosts sent in his spirit by the 
former prophets. 

As if he wanted to say: "I court them through the 
prophets", as it says in Hosea 3) [Cap. 6, 5.], | have 
spared no effort and labor to bring them back from their 
ungodliness to the word of God, but they have continued 
obstinately and turned their backs on me. But from this 
passage is taken what we read in our [Nicene] Creed: 
"Who spoke through the prophets," and what Peter says 
in his [second] epistle [Cap. 1, 21.]: "The holy men of 
GOD have spoken, driven by the Holy Spirit." 


V. 13. 4) Just as they preached and did not hear. 


Just as the prophets preached and they did not hear, 
so | did not hear them when they called. Thus should 
have been translated in the conjunctive [: cum 
clamarent instead of: sic clamabunt in the Vulgate], for 
the Hebrews have no conjunctive. The Lord himself 
testifies that they called upon the name of the Lord, 
which was certainly a very good thing to do. And if ever 
anything is attributed to the powers of so-called free will, 
much is attributed to them here, namely, the invocation 
of the name of GOD. But still, because they would not 
hear the word of God, it was therefore impossible that 
they should be heard when they called. Therefore, we 
should learn from this: if we want our petitions to be 
heard, we should first hear the word of the LORD, 
otherwise He will not hear, however you may mourn and 
cry out, even if you burst. 


V. 14. So | scattered them among all the nations. 


This is a well-chosen and emphatic word in Hebrew, 
which our [latei-

nischer] Interpreter translated by the word dispergere. 
But it is in the Hebrew: And by a whirlwind | have 
scattered them among all the Gentiles, as if to say, With 
the impetuosity of a tempest | have scattered them and 
brought them to different places. No one could resist, so 
the terrifying storm took them away; | did not care about 
their mourning. 


And is the land behind them remained desolate. 


For there remained none to till it and inhabit it, but all 
became desolate. 


And is the noble (desiderabilis) land made desolate. 


Here is the word that is also found in Haggai 1) [Cap. 
2, 8.]: "Then shall come the consolation of all the 
Gentiles" (desideratus). They had an exceedingly great 
pleasure in the city of Jerusalem and in their land; they 
did not like to be torn away from it. But no matter how 
much they enjoyed it, they were still pushed out and 
driven out by the storm.

The eighth chapter. 


This chapter is also easy and clear from the previous 
one. For | have said that it is necessary to observe how 
the prophet describes two times: the one in which the 
people were brought back from captivity, and also the 
temple and the city were rebuilt, that the Lord, though 
from very small remnants, as it were from the ashes, 
stirred up a conflagration in the whole world, for in this 
some were preserved for the sake of the promises; the 
other, in which he describes the already present and 
reigning Christ. In this chapter, the prophet repeats, as it 
were in a recapitulation, all that he has dealt with in many 
parables and many visions. Here he repeats the same 
thing with completely open words, so that one can not 
unjustly call this chapter a gloss and interpretation of 
everything that has gone before. 


V. 2. | was almost very jealous over Zion. 


Above | have explained in detail what zeal is. In summa 
he says this: Hitherto have | been very angry with Zion, 
| have destroyed it by the Chaldeans, and have afflicted 
it severely, but yet have not utterly rejected it, but as a 
husband out of love scolds his wife when he sees her 
lacking in any thing, so also | 2c. For | will not further 





anger, since | have already returned to Jerusalem, now 
follow mercy and peace, not revenge or hatred. 


V. 3. Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth, and 
the mountain of the LORD of hosts a mountain of 


holiness. 

The "mountain of the Lord" he calls Mount Moriah, 
which is in the middle of the city of Jerusalem. These 
titles are very high, and very great the price of the city 
and the mountain. But this holiness and truth he does not 
ascribe to the inhabitants of the city, that they are holy or 
true, but because he himself will dwell in Jerusalem, who 
is holy, yea, holiness itself and all truth. Otherwise, 
looking at the people, they are unholy and godless, since 
they kill the prophets and Christ Himself. But by the word 
of God preached there, the city becomes holy and the 
mountain true, and then the people also become holy, 
who have God's word. For this means that God dwells in 
a place when He dwells there through His holy Word and 
through the Holy Spirit. This took place in Jerusalem, so 
that they could not doubt God's will, since He had 
promised in all certainty that He would be in that place 
and answer the prayers. In short, they had in the Temple 
what we call 


2072 xxvm, 108-iro. Interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 8, 3-8. 


2073 





in Christ. Thus, by an outward sign, God always wants 
to guide the consciences and make them certain, so that 
they will not doubt His will, nor wander about uncertainly 
as to what God approves, and be hurled, as it were, as 
blind men to an uncertain goal. Just as we are therefore 
quite certain that we will be heard in Christ, that we 
understand the will of God over us, so they were also 
quite certain, when they worshipped in the Temple 1) 
that God was present and would hear them 2c. In sum, 
therefore, the prophet says this: They will be faithful, | 
will again establish the right service, they will have the 
pure word of God, through which | will always be 
present. 


V. 4. There shall yet dwell in the streets of 
Jerusalem old men and women. 

This must be related to the heart movements of those 
to whom it is said. At that time, they were in such a state 
of distress: as things were going, nothing was going 
well, nothing was going out well for them, the fruits did 
not prosper well, everything corresponded to the desires 
in a bad way. Then they were surrounded by enemies 
who attacked them and prevented them from continuing 
to build the temple. Thus the Persian king Cambyses 
with his godless rulers stopped them, so that they could 
not complete the building begun under Cyrus. In short, 
there were almost nothing but rebellions, wars, and 
treachery, so that they could see nothing but that all 
things were in despair, and they thought that it was all 
over for them and the kingdom. To these and similar 
heartbreaks that they had, the Lord here comforts and 
consoles them, so that they may not doubt that the 
kingdom will be unharmed and glorious and populous. 
For such comforts were first held out under Haggai and 
Zechariah, as if to say: All will be pacified; no more will 
be heard of disturbances or movements in the land, the 
city of Jerusalem will be populous, the babes and 
maidens will play safely in the streets 2c. But this seems 
to be quite impossible for you; but be confident, | will 
bring it about very easily.

V. 7. Behold, | will redeem my people from the land 
against the going forth. 


This passage, with those that follow, is drawn by 
some to Christ, and not at all inconsistently; if someone 
wants to hold on to the emphasis ["I will redeem"], he 
can keep it up. But | would rather deal with and refer to 
Christ those sayings [of Christ] which actually go to 
Christ, and which in fact hold the kingdom of Christ in 
them, setting aside those which can be rejected in one 
way or the other. Therefore, let us remain in the context 
of the foregoing. He says that the city will be full of 
people, that all the streets will be filled with old men, 
maidens and boys, however few they may be, however 
hopeless and weak all things now seem, as can be seen 
in Nehemiah, that at that time barely the tenth part of the 
city had been rebuilt, while the remaining parts were 
desolate and devastated by fire. Nothing less seemed to 
be able to happen than that the deserted and miserably 
devastated city should be transformed into a populous, 
respectable and lovely place. But God has a way of 
making everything out of nothing, so that we boast 
nothing of our powers. So he immediately adds: "I will 
redeem my people from the land against the going out 
and from the land against the going down of the sun", 
that is, | will bring back both those of Judah and those of 
Israel from Babylon and from other parts of the whole 
world, wherever they may be, so that Jerusalem may be 
inhabited. 


V. 8. 2) In dignity and righteousness. 


That is, my worship will be a right, true and pure one, 
namely because of the Word and the godly people who 
are in my people. Otherwise, idolatry has never ceased 
among this people, but for the sake of the Word and the 
Holy Spirit, which was in some godly people, he says, he 
will spare them, so that they will not fear destruction 
again 2c.

2074 XXVIII, 110-112. Interpretations on the prophets. 





V. 10. 1) For before those days the labor of men was 
in vain 2c. 


He depicts the miserable state of the community that 
existed before this prophecy, namely, the prosperity of 
all things was not happy: the fields had not returned the 
seed entrusted to them with usury, the greatest poverty 
had prevailed and the fear of attacks, as can be seen 
from the first chapter of Haggai. Thus they were ruled by 
rage and cruelty and the highest misfortune in all things, 
not peace, not truth and justice. But it is a way of 
speaking of the Scripture, since it says: merces 
hominum non erat [the people had no wages.] We 
simply give this way of speaking negatively like this: 
"What the people worked, that was lost, it carried 
nothing", everything was thrown into a sack full of holes 
2c. So we see how the Scriptures speak of the merit of 
men, namely of what follows works, not of merits. 


V. 12. But they shall be seeds of peace. 


This is again a Hebrew way of speaking, as if he 
wanted to say: From these very small remnants | will 
raise up for myself an innumerable people, | will kindle a 
great conflagration from a little spark, they shall be to me 
a seed of peace, that is, it shall be happy and well with 
them, they shall be multiplied like the seed, as he then 
adds many things. 


V. 13. 1) And it shall come to pass, as ye of the 
house of Judah and of the house of Israel have been a 
curse among the heathen. 


He also includes Israel in the promise, although it 
was prophesied that Israel should never be brought 
back. But | have said that this must be understood in this 
way: there is no doubt that many were also brought back 
from Israel, but that the kingdom and the name were 
never restored, but the name and the kingdom were 
never restored. 


1) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 





2075 





The kingdom of Judah, the government and the 
priesthood were restored. Israel was led away to Media 
and never regained a leader, a worship or any secular 
government after that. Therefore, those who were 
brought back from Israel were counted as Judah. But 
that they were a curse or a blessing to the Gentiles, that 
is, that they were an example to them, as the Latins also 
say. They were an example of the curse, because the 
one desired such a miserable rejection and captivity from 
the other, as it had been given to them from God's wrath 
2c. 


V. 14: How | intended to afflict you. 


He always looks at the troubled consciences, which 
were quite miserably depressed before. Therefore, the 
feeling of the past misfortune was still left. He always 
distracts the consciences from these troubles and terrors 
caused by the past misfortune and strengthens them 
again by exceedingly great and rich promises and 
consolations. But this required great faith that could 
grasp this. To reason, everything seemed quite 
hopeless. 


V. 16. Speak one with the other truth. 


He does not insist on ceremonies or sacrifices, which 
they held in high esteem, but demands the very good 
works of love, as we have said quite extensively in the 
previous chapter, as if to say: As | am righteous and true, 
so shall you also be. 


And judge rightly, and make peace. 


[Veritatem et judicium pacis judicate,] this is a 
strange set of words. But the opinion is: Let every man 
be true and sincere toward his neighbor; let him do what 
he speaks, let him speak what he does. He shall not 
present himself as a friend, and prove himself as an 
enemy; neither shall he show bread with one hand, and 
offer a stone with the other. Then judge rightly, do not 
hold unjust judgment, because from unjust judgment 
arises hatred, from hatred reenactment, from 
reenactment rebellion and wars; and so | interpret 
judicium pacis [judgment for peace].

2077 





V. 17: And let no man think evil in his heart against 
his neighbor. 


Thus the Scriptures everywhere demand mercy and 
not sacrifice, that we should do good to one another, that 
one should help the other with counsel and action. In 
particular, God wants us to take care of the oppressed 
and the afflicted, on whom He looks, as He says, as 
Scripture teaches everywhere: The eyes of the Lord look 
on the afflicted [Is. 66, 2]. 


And do not love false oaths. 


This can be understood by false worship and religion, 
when we misuse the name of God for our statutes and 
invented services, as | have interpreted above in the fifth 
chapter. But everyone may follow what he wants. 


v. 19. The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh and 
tenth months. 


Here the question of fasting is solved, which was 
raised above and has been abundantly interpreted by 
us. He dismisses all those human statutes, as if he 
wanted to say: | do not want you to be afflicted, not that 
you are hungry, because what do | have to do with your 
fasting? but | want to change your sorrow into joy, so that 
as you were sorrowful before in those days, now you can 
eat and drink all the more freely and be joyful. But in our 
[Latin] Bible this is badly translated: in solemnitates 
praeclaras. For so it should have been translated: at 
sweet or good feasts. This may have given the ungodly 
preachers of the Mass the occasion to misuse this 
passage for the confirmation of their ungodly statutes, 
so that they thought that these fasts must be holidays, 
and that they were worthy of being generally spread and 
held up to the people, that they should follow this way, 
while the prophet expressly denies that one should 
follow them any further. But he so carefully inculcates 
the works of love, because that is the way of hypocrisy 
and human statutes, that they turn away from the truth 
and the consideration of the neighbor, which still today 
the godless sects of the monks are doing. 





teach quite clearly, especially those that are considered 
the holiest, as the Carthusians 2c. 


V. 20. Many nations and citizens of many cities are 
yet to come. 


This passage has also been referred to Christ. 
Although this is not contrary to opinion, the whole 
passage cannot be referred to it, so we will stick to the 
previous view. He says, the inhabitants of many cities 
will come together here, not only you, but the inhabitants 
of many cities (for so (habitatores instead of habitent] 
must be read), and 
[The inhabitants of one city will go to another, saying, 
"Let us go to pray before the Lord." Then it is added a 
little further on [v. 22], "To seek the LORD of hosts in 
Jerusalem." If this piece were not added, | too would 
have referred this passage to Christ. Therefore we will 
interpret it from the literal and legal service of God, and 
it will be the opinion which Lucas sets forth in Acts Cap. 
2, 1) 5. "Now there were Jews dwelling at Jerusalem, 
who were godly men out of all the people that are under 
heaven." The temple was finally so honored that even 
princes and queens from distant lands adorned it with 
their gifts, as Josephus relates. 


We also want to go with you. 2) 


Jerome holds that this is not said in the person of 
God, as some want, but in the person of the people. The 
passage is ambiguous, and which opinion is the better, | 
leave undecided. If it is said in the person of God, this 
will be the opinion: | will be in the midst of them, and will 
be their God, as is said elsewhere. And so it must be 
understood not only by the Jews, but by all the godly 
from all peoples of the whole world, who came together 
there because of the service 2c. 


1) In our prelims: “etor. 1.

2079 





v.23. At that time ten men from all the languages of 
the Gentiles will take a Jewish man by the scruff of his 
neck. 


He ties the time when the captives have been brought 
back to the time of Christ's kingdom. He says that ten 
men from all the languages of the Gentiles in the whole 
world will take hold of the corner of a Jew to go with him. 
This passage the Jews whimsically press, saying this 
has never been fulfilled. But there is a great 
inconsistency in their interpretation, so that it cannot be 
understood as they dream. Therefore, it cannot be 
referred to the outward and bodily tip of a garment, but 
to the preaching of the gospel, as if to say, There shall 
be the gospel 





lium will be preached throughout the world, and will bear 
such great fruit that one apostle (or, as others would 
have it, Christ) will convert many thousands of people to 
godliness through his preaching. They will follow of their 
own free will, not forced by the law, but guided by the 
Holy Spirit. Thus the number ten, because it is the circle 
of the whole count, means the totality of all who are to 
be converted to the faith in any language. Then the 
prophet also indicates this secretly, that they will not 
come into this kingdom, because they were chosen and 
determined according to a certain number. This certain 
number stands alone with God, who calls and chooses 
according to his will, whom he wills, and nothing lies in 
our powers or our presumption, but in his mercy. 


The ninth chapter. 


The first part of this prophet is approximately finished. In 
what follows, he will prophesy of things to come, namely 
of what follows in the times until Christ and after Christ. 
However, the first part of this chapter is extraordinarily 
obscure and is treated in many different ways by all 
interpreters, and yet this diversity is not yet sufficient for 
all of them. Some of them take it from Babylon, others 
from the Maccabees, Jerome refers the whole thing to 
Christ, and yet all of them do not reach the goal. It is 
quite clear and plain what the prophet speaks of the 
burden, for so reads the inscription of the chapter. 
Therefore, where there is a burden of the word of the 
Lord, some evil or future tribulation must be foretold and 
indicated, which happens regularly with all prophets. 
And yet here also, at the same time as the 
preannouncement of the distress, he brings in grace, as 
he records below [v. 7]: "And | will put their blood out of 
their mouth, and their abominations out of their teeth." 
In short, this is my opinion about this first part of the 
chapter, that the prophet wants to prophesy and 
prophesy that it will happen, 


that the neighboring Gentiles who are around 
Jerusalem, Tyre, Sidon and all the land of the Philistines, 
will indeed be converted to the gospel of Christ, which 
has been revealed throughout the whole world, but 
nevertheless this grace will be preceded by great 
calamity, disturbance and tribulation, as if to say: It will 
indeed happen that our neighbors will also go with us, 
that we will have the same faith with them, but they will 
not arrive at this grace otherwise than well chastened, 
they will first suffer the punishments of their ungodliness, 
and because they have very often afflicted us 
exceedingly miserably and cruelly. This seems to me to 
be the right opinion; if this does not fit, | see nothing else 
by which | can wriggle out of this very great darkness. 
For everything is said by the prophet in a very dark way, 
so that the prophecy, which was made dark, was not 
understood until the Jews saw these things happen. But 
about Tyre and Sidon, the very rich cities (because they 
were sea cities, which had abundance of the best goods 
of every kind), the histories are to be looked up. But 
these cities were destroyed twice: once by the 


2080 k. xxvili, 116-118. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), cap. 9, 1-3. 


2081 





the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar. Ezekiel 
commemorates this destruction [Cap. 29, 19] with many 
words: "Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, led his 
army with great difficulty before Tyre" 2c. Then this 
happened also by the king Alexander, who received the 
epithet "the Great". This history is written by the 
historians of the Gentiles, and also in the evangelical 
history this destruction is mentioned, since Christ says 
[Matth. 11, 21.]: "Woe to you, Chorazin, woe to you, 
Bethsaida! if such deeds had happened in Tyro and 
Sidon" 2c. In this passage Christ himself testifies that 
these cities were destroyed and exterminated from the 
ground up, which happened in the last desolation by 
Alexander the Great. After the death of Alexander, there 
was a constant discord, bitter hatred and strife between 
the kings of Egypt and Syria; there were often fierce 
battles with changing fortunes, and not without 
misfortune and great destruction for the cities that lay 
between them. For whichever of the two was victorious, 
they were subdued and plundered by him 2c. See the 
history of the Maccabees and Josephus. 


V. 1. About the land of Hadrach. 1) 


Jerome thinks that this word is composed of two single 
words, and perhaps not unrhymed. But it is a new word, 
which the prophet formed for this purpose, so that he 
would make the prophecy dark. It means "a gift", 


pincernam, and the prophet used the etymology of the 
words to describe the customs of those cities, namely the 
indulgence and the softness and the highest wealth, as if 
he wanted to say: We are now poor, made low, all our 
things are sad, we are laboring to the utmost to rebuild 
the temple and to repair the wretched ruins of our city; 
you Syrians are gift-givers, there is happy increase in all 
things, you have a great abundance and plenty of all 
things, you live according to your pleasure sleepily and 
securely, you are not at all anxious about any misfortune, 
but in a little while there will be 


1) In both the Erlangen and the Weimar: 





that your cities also may be laid waste and your revelry 
subdued, so that, having thus overcome, you may rejoice 
with us in the grace revealed through the gospel. 


And about Damascus, on which it relies. 


Namely, on Syria, that is, on Damascus,] which is the 
defiance or head of Syria, on which it trusts and relies the 
most. 


For the Lord looks upon men. 


(Quia Domini est oculus hominis - for the eye of the 
Lord is the eye of man) is a scriptural expression that the 


prophet also used in the third Psalm [v. 9]: Domini est 


salus, that is, "with thee is help". So here: that the people 
see and all the tribes of Israel, that is not with them, but 
with the Lord. It is he who gives sight. But it is the opinion 
of this passage: Another change is near and imminent, 
the burden is before the hands, there will soon be 
another kingdom. The Lord will give sight to all men, that 
is, the light will dawn from the Lord. For this passage 
proves that it must be understood by the spiritual eyes. 


And to all the tribes of Israel. 


As if he wanted to say: You Syrians and Philistines seem 
to be clever, you think that everything is in the light before 
you, and that we lie wrapped in darkness. But it is another 
light, another seeing, than as you think, for it is with the 
Lord, who will give the eye to all of us and to all the tribes 
of Israel, that we not only see what is to be seen, but also 
rejoice in what is seen; for so the Scripture often uses the 
word see [for: "to see with delight"). But this new light is 
the gospel, by which hearts are enlightened, and which 
enlightens the darkest darkness. 


V. 2, 3. 2) Also over Hamath, which borders with it; 
over Tyre and Sidon also, which are almost wise. 


2) These verse numbers are missing in the Weimar.

2083 








That is, this burden will not only weigh down those 
drunkards and pleasure-seekers, but also Hamath (this 
is a city now called Antioch), which is near Damascus. 
All these, he says, seem to be wise, and they are indeed 
wise in the eyes of the world, but another wisdom is 
needed. But he explains this wisdom of the world and of 
reason, by which this whole region was famous, and 
points expressly to Tyre, as he adds [v. 3]: "For Tyre 
builds strong" 2c., as if he wanted to say: She is 
surrounded with very strong walls, riches flow to her 
everywhere, she thinks she will be safe against all 
attacks of the enemies. Thus it has many things that give 
strength to the community, a large amount of silver and 
gold, but all this will be of no use to it, it will not be able 
to be preserved. But this city was very rich and 
prosperous, so the Macedonian Alexander could not 
overcome it without great danger to his own, so great 
was the power and wealth of this city. Finally, however, 
it was defeated, as will be added: 


V. 4. See, the Lord will destroy them (possidebit 
eam). 

For on the sea their power will be defeated. Thus | 
connect the order of the speech, otherwise there is no 
connection. But | take it in a good sense that the Lord 
says he will possess Tyre, that the opinion is: The Lord 
will also dwell in Tyre through his word. But this 
possession will be preceded by a great calamity; the 
power that Tyre has on the sea will be struck first, and 
she herself will be consumed by fire. 


V. 5. When the asclone will see, she will be terrified. 


Furthermore, he declares that the burden also applies 
to the other neighboring cities. Appoints but the capitals 
and the most distinguished cities of the kingdom of the 
Philistines, which were in the highest flourishing. And 
however small this kingdom was, it often dared to 
oppose the mightiest and greatest empires. They have 
caused much trouble to the Jews; often the Jews have 
also been beaten by them. 





but here he says that their defiance will pass away, for 
which we read [in the Vulgate]: quoniam confusa est 


Spes (the word ejus is too much), that is, their 
presumption will be made less, the men will be taken 
from them who can well counsel for the preservation of 
the state. If these are lacking in a community, no armed 
forces, riches or weapons can be sufficient. 


V. 6. Strangers will dwell in Ashdod. 1) 


Jerome referred this to Christ, but this does not fit at 
all. In Hebrew, however, it is written thus: And there will 
dwell, that is, a harlot in Ashdod, that is, after the natives 
and the right inhabitants are beaten and exterminated, it 
will be inhabited by strangers and arrivals to whom it did 
not belong. So completely, he says, they will perish, as 
it is also said that hardly any remains of these so rich 
cities are left, which at that time were very strong and 
populous, so that | also often wonder about the power of 
those cities, although they were few. 


V. 7 And | will put their blood out of their mouths. 

This passage promises grace, which | reminded at 
the beginning of this chapter. Therefore the opinion is: 
They are murderers and robbers, likewise idolaters and 
great sinners. All these sins | will take away from them 
(for this is what he calls "blood," namely, the sins of the 
flesh), but | will take them away through the gospel. This 
was done through the preaching of the apostles who 
passed through these cities. 


That they also may remain for our God. 


That is, it will also be a part of the remnant of God's 
people that will be preserved through the gospel. 


That they may become like the princes (or 
teachers) in Judah. 


That is, they will be so converted, and so great fruit 
will the gospel bear, 


1) Vulgate: Lt sstsdit ssparntor in “oto. 


2084 v- xxvm, 120-123. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), cap. 9, 7-9. 


2085 





that there are also teachers of the word who are like the 
teachers and princes of Judah and can contend with 
them. Thus is the prophecy obscured, by which the 
prophet intended to indicate that Christ's kingdom would 
be only in spiritual hearts instructed and cleansed by the 
gospel, even among the Gentiles, which the Jews 
believed would never happen. 


And Ekron like the Jebusites. 


That is, they will be proselytes of the faith, just as the 
Jebusites were proselytes and fellow believers with the 
Jews in Jerusalem. They will believe the gospel of Christ 
as the Jews did 2c. 


v.8. And | myself will be the camp around my 
house. 


In Hebrew [instead of circumdabo] it says: | will set 
up camp. The same word is in the Psalm [Ps. 34, 8.]: 
"The angel of the Lord camps around those who fear 
him", that means, after the manner of an army of war, he 
surrounds the godly people with the protection of the 
angels, and makes the angels their guardians, so that 
they cannot be hurt from any side. The same way of 
speaking is also here, as if he wanted to say: | want to 
fortify this church, which | have gathered from Gentiles 
and Jews, "so that the driver will no longer pass over 
them", so that the godly will no longer be hostile to the 
driver, that is, to the lawgiver, but will be governed and 
guided by the spirit. Therefore, | will give diligent and 
vigilant apostles and preachers of the word, who will 
administer their office well and preserve the flock 
entrusted to them, so that the wolves do not attack it, so 
that the false teachers do not rage against it and scatter 
and destroy the souls. Thus, those who preside over the 
ministry of the Word are Christ's warriors, who go and 
sow the Word and constantly fight against the devil, both 
for the hearers and for the Word, since the devil is 
always going about seeking whom he may devour, as 
Peter says, and lead away from Christ by the beaters, 
that is, by the teachers of works and human 
righteousness 2c. 





For | have now looked at it with my eyes. 

Now that the law has been destroyed and taken 
away, | see a spiritual people, and that both the Gentiles 
and the Jews are gathered together in One Sheepfold. 


V. 9. But you daughter of Zion, rejoice greatly. 

This is, as | said, the second part of this chapter, in 
which he gives extremely rich comfort and describes the 
spread of the kingdom of Christ over the whole world 
among all Gentiles. But this passage is very well known, 
also cited by the evangelists and treated by us in detail 
in the postilion. 


Behold, your King is coming to you, a righteous 
man and a helper. 

The description of this king is wonderful. As he is very 
different from all the kings of the world, so he ascribes to 
him a very different office and very different royal honors 
than those befitting a worldly king. Here is no force, no 
weapons, no violence, no wrath or anger, for all these 
befit the kings of the world, but only kindness, 
righteousness, salvation, mercy and all good, in short, 
he is the servant of the kindness and mercy of GOD. He 
is righteous, for he makes righteous; he is a savior, for 
he makes blessed, which no king could ever accomplish, 
and it is far too great for any man to accomplish. But it is 
all spiritual and pictures a spiritual kingdom, which is 
evident from the coming and the future of this righteous 
king, since he comes in lowliness and rides on an ass; 
then not accompanied by the war power of his subjects, 
but the powers of the people are in the king, not those of 
the king in the people, which is the case with the worldly 
kings. But this whole passage stands in a contradiction. 
For if this king of ours is righteous and comes to save us, 
it is evident that we are ungodly sinners and condemned, 
otherwise he would come in vain to save us and make 
us righteous. 


Arm. 
The Hebrew word actually does not mean "poor", but 
more correctly it would be translated as "poor". 


2086 D- xxvm, 123-125. interpretations on the prophets. 


2087 





by the word humilis, in German: "miserable". This is how 
Lucas wanted to translate it in the hymn of Mary [Luc. 1, 
48.]: "For he looked upon the lowliness of his handmaid." 
Hence the opinion: your King comes to you to bring you 
righteousness and blessedness. But all splendor, all 
royal adornment is lacking; there is no glory or splendor 
to be seen, but he comes as one lowly and lowly, and as 


one of the great multitude (éy TOV todo), like 

some common man who does not distinguish himself 
from others by any royal insignia. Then he is not followed 
by horses or chariots, but rides on the smallest animal, a 
donkey. 


V. 10: For | will take the chariots away from 
Ephraim. 


The singular [quadrigam in the Vulgate] stands for 
the plural. Here again it includes both tribes, both Israel 
and Judah. In Ephraim the kingdom was Israel, but in 
Jerusalem Judah. Therefore this passage is full of 
comfort and even rich, as if he wanted to say: Although 
Israel was taken away to Media and never brought back, 
yet | will accept it at the same time with Judah and make 
it One Kingdom, namely that in Israel and in Judah the 
same faith and spirit shall be. But this will be a spiritual 
kingdom, therefore | will put away all outward weapons, 
chariots and horses, and everything that belongs to an 
outward kingdom. All these things do not belong here, 
just as | do not lead any of these things and do not display 
anything less than any outward appearance, or 
weapons, or the image of an outward kingdom. | am a 
righteous king and a helper, therefore my kingdom will 
also be like that and will be lowly and lowly in 
appearance, with nothing royal about it. But | will clothe 
with spiritual power those who will fight in this kingdom of 
mine. They will rule, not over men, but over death, sin 
and hell and the devil, so that there will be no creature 
that can stand against them. They shall be princes unto 
salvation. And this is what he calls "removing the chariots 
from Ephraim". So also says Isaiah [Cap. 2, 4]: "They will 
turn their swords into plowshares" 2c. 





The same is what the prophet adds here: "I will turn away 
the horses from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be 
broken," that is, there will no longer be any inclination to 
arms, and the animals will not be armed for battle. 


For he will teach peace among the Gentiles. 


This is the reason for the preceding. That is, he will 
preach forgiveness of sins, which reconciles God and 
men; where this is, it cannot be otherwise than that at the 
same time there is also love among us, and peace of one 
with the other. Weapons are easily despised and set 
aside. Certainly this is the case, for Christians do not fight 
among themselves, for they are a people of peace. They 
are like their king: they bless those who curse them, they 
do good to their enemies, they leave the coat to him who 
takes their skirts. But he says, "among the Gentiles," 
because Ephrainl is scattered among the Gentiles. 
Therefore, the peace preached among the Gentiles will 
also find Ephraim. 


And his dominion will be from sea to sea. 

He took this saying from the 72nd Psalm, v. 8: "He will 
reign from sea to sea" 2c. This is a very clear passage of 
the spiritual kingdom of Christ, by which the Jews can be 
shut up, who imagine a carnal king, while here it is clearly 
said that the King Christ will reign over the whole world, 
but without force and without weapons, which cannot 
possibly happen in a carnal kingdom. 


V.11. You also let your captives out of the pit by the 
blood of your covenant. 
There is an emphasis on the pronoun "you". After 
describing the king and the kingdom of peace, he now 
describes the way in which this kingdom was set up, or 
how highly the king was to be blamed for setting up this 
kingdom. And this whole passage is a kind of quarrel, 
because he explicitly distinguishes the blood of the old 
testament from the own blood of this 


2088 L. XXVIII, I2S-127. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 9, 11. 12. 


2089 





King, as if to say: Moses had blood, but that of goats and 
calves, but you have your own blood, by which you 
confirm your testament. The author of the Epistle to the 
Hebrews explains this passage beautifully [Cap. 9, 12]: 
"Not by the blood of goats or calves, but by his own blood 
he entered the holy place once, and found eternal 
redemption" 2c. 

This passage of the redeemed prisoners Jerome and 
Lyra interpret from the fathers who were saved from the 


outer castle (limbo) of hell. For so [limbus] they call it 
with a word invented by them. And it is to be wondered 
at that so great men, out of drowsiness, have often 
stumbled so exceedingly unrhymed, and that in 
passages which contain the greatest consolation, where 
it is a question of the epitome of our blessedness, as this 
passage also is, telling their dreams of the fathers, while 
it is said of the salvation of all believers, which is to be 
prepared by the shedding of the blood of Christ. For if the 
fathers were not saved and made righteous until they 
went to hell, they would never be brought back, there 
would be no salvation left. For salvation must be 
preceded by the forgiveness of sins, which must be 
granted to us while we are alive. So it happened also to 
the fathers, for they were saved while living and 
preserved by faith, by which we are to be preserved. For 
"all have eaten one kind of spiritual food, and all have 
drunk one kind of spiritual drink. "2c. [1 Cor. 10, 3. f.] only 
that this blood was not yet revealed; but they believed 
that it should be revealed. Against such quite clear 
passages the holy fathers often babble most 
abominably, so that their sleepiness in the holy 
Scriptures grieves me. Moreover, | do not believe that 
there is such a prebnrg of hell, which they praise so 
much, but do not base on any acceptable testimony of 
the Scriptures. The Scripture says that the dead fathers 
sleep in the Lord, are preserved in the Lord's hand; it 
does not say that they are relegated to an outer castle of 
hell 2c. But the prophet is speaking here of the testament 
of Christ, which does not concern the dead at all, since 





they cannot hear, but the living. Therefore, while we are 
alive, the gospel is proclaimed to us and the forgiveness 
of sins through the blood of Christ, which was shed for 
us. And so, in the manner of a contender, he contrasts 
this own blood of the king with the blood of calves and 
goats, which Moses used in his testament. But this 
testament of the king, confirmed by his own blood, is the 
forgiveness of sins and eternal bliss, as the author of the 
letter to the Hebrews [Cap. 9, 15] saws. So also is that 
to be taken which he says of the letting out of the 
captives, as if to say, In the first testament the bound 
were let out of Egypt, and led into the land of Canaan; 
but thou bringest the captives "out of the pit, where there 
is no water within," that is, out of death, sin, and hell. For 
those who feel sin, in truth feel death and hell, they have 
no peace, no refreshment, but eternal thirst. And in this 
pit we are immediately, as we were born, until death, 
unless we are brought out by Christ. 


V. 12. Return therefore to the fortress. 


This is an exhortation and a comfort, as if he wanted 
to say: Since the King Christ, the Savior, has already 
been revealed, also the gospel has been heard, return 
to the fortress. But he does not indicate a certain place 
of the fortress, but still persists in the strife. The first 
testament had a place held out to them, to which they 
aspired, namely the land of Canaan. But many of them 
murmured in the wilderness and here and there 
elsewhere, so they perished and did not obtain what they 
wanted, as this is also abundantly interpreted in the 
epistle to the Hebrews. Therefore, lest anything like this 
happen to you, take hold of the gospel and believe, now 
that you have been brought out of the pit, so that you 
may not be deprived of comfort southward, as they were 
deprived of the land of Canaan, which was most certainly 
destined for them to seek. And to this certain place he 
opposes here the "fortress", but he does not name a 
certain place, as if he wanted to say: 


2090 L. xxvill, 127-129. interpretations on the prophets. 


This is the nature of this fortress: if you seize it, you will 
be safe against all attempts of sin, death and hell. 


You who lie imprisoned on hope (Vincti spei). 


This piece answers an objection of the flesh, which 
cannot see this dominion over all creatures in the 
Christians, yes, it seems to him to be completely the 
opposite. For Christians are exposed to all evils, 
wretched and despised by the world, they suffer 
persecution, they feel sin, the fear of death 2c. Against 
this thought he answers as if to say: It does not seem to 
be a fortress; you are still imprisoned and it does not 
seem otherwise, as if you were still under death and sin. 
But be of good cheer, ye are "captives of hope," that is, 
ye are blessed indeed, but in hope, as the apostle [Rom. 
8:24] saith. This salvation from the pit by the blood of 
Christ is in hope; it is not seen; the blessedness and 
righteousness is hidden. But it is a Hebrew way of 


speaking, since he calls them prisoners of hope (vinctos 


Spel), as Paul also calls himself [Eph. 3, 1.] a prisoner of 
Christ, and his bonds he calls Christ's and the gospel's 
bonds [Phil. 1, 13.], that is, which he suffers for the sake 
of Christ and the gospel. 


For this day also will | proclaim, and repay thee for 
double. 


This "today" is also wonderfully interpreted in the epistle 
to the Hebrews [Cap. 3, 7. 4, 7.]. This dividing could be 
understood by the multiplication of the people or the 
Spirit from the preaching of the Gospel, as if he said: 
"You were one thing to me, and a small herd in the land 
of Judah, but by the preaching of the Gospel | will cause 
you to be divided unto me, that with you also Israel may 
believe, and all the peoples of the whole world. But | like 
more the other opinion, which is also in Isaiah [Cap. 40, 
2.]: "She hath received double from the hand of the Lord 
for all her sin." So here: "This day will | declare, and repay 
thee for double." There the word "repay" does not entail 
merit, that not 


2091 


It is pure grace, because instead of the sins that were 
taken away, he has restored twofold grace, that is, he 
takes away from us the law and sin, which are the two 
greatest evils. And sin and death constantly accompany 
the law, because the power of sin is the law, and sin is 
the sting of death. It was not enough that we should be 
delivered from sin, if the author of sin were not also taken 
away, namely the law, which causes sin to become more 
powerful [Rom. 5, 20.], and 1) it demands and accuses 
us, that the conscience can never be joyful. But this 
redemption is through the blood of the King. In sum, the 
prophet deals with it: he describes the way in which the 
king attains to this kingdom of blessedness and 
righteousness. Through the Word we are made 
righteous and delivered, we are transferred from the 
kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light through the 
power of the blood of Christ, and then we live in hope. 


Vv. 13 For | have made Judah my bow, and | have 
made Ephraim my armor. 


Then follows the multiplication and spreading, the 
benefit of this thing. For from Judah and Ephraim, he 
says, this grace should also be propagated among all the 
Gentiles. But this honor he gives to Judah and Ephraim, 
that he first names them, deun to them actually belonged 
Christ, because he was promised to them. "Salvation 
comes from the Jews," says John [Cap. 4:22]. And Paul 
everywhere puts the Jews first when he speaks of the 
justified Jews and Gentiles [Rom. 1:16.]: "The Jews first 
and also the Greeks." But this, which now follows, seems 
to dispute with the preceding, since he says [v. 10.] that 
he will put away the bows and chariots of Ephraim, also 
the horses of Jerusalem, and has ordered the whole 
kingdom in word and spirit, and here again remembers 
the weapons, bows, and swords. | answer: The former 
statement is the summa and the real condition, since the 
lowly king described 


1) Weimarsche: ut; Erlanger: 6t. We have followed the latter 
reading.

2093 





how he walks along without any royal adornment. For so 
he also went, and therefore he also described his 
kingdom as such, and those who belong to this kingdom. 
This he said with clear words and without any picture, so 
that it cannot be understood differently. Therefore these 
figurative speeches are to be referred to the preceding 
simple representation. And so the sword, the bow and 
the other things are to be understood figuratively, so that 
they do not seem to argue with the previous revealed 
saying. Therefore the opinion is: These two kingdoms, 
both Judah and Ephraim, | will seize; but | will make use 
of their conversion, not only among the Jews, but for the 
conversion of all peoples in the whole world, because 
through them | will spread the gospel in the world and 
use their ministry, that they also should proclaim to the 
Gentiles the salvation offered to them through my blood. 
| will draw Judah as my bow, that is, through it | will hurl 
the preaching of the gospel like arrows, so that many 
Gentiles, struck by this bow of mine, will be subjected to 
me. Thus it is also said in the Psalm [Ps. 45:6]: "Sharp 
are your arrows, that the nations fall down before you" 
2c. 


And Ephraim equipped. 


That is, the apostles and other disciples | will fill with 
the Holy Spirit, that they may hurl arrows among the 
Gentiles by the word of grace. And this is the 
interpretation of what he said above [v. 10.], "He shall 
teach peace among the Gentiles, and his dominion shall 
be from sea to sea." 


And will set you as a sword of giants. 


That is, the word of the gospel will be effective, it will 
break through and bear abundant fruit among the 
Gentiles. 


Vv. 14. And the Lord will appear over them. 


That is, the disciples, the apostles, and the preachers of 
the gospel will make known and confirm the power of the 
word by miracles and their constancy, so that, after he 
has seen the signs and the strength of heart at 





No one can deny that the power of God is in them, that 
the Lord uses their ministry in His cause, as His 
instruments. 


And his arrows will go out like lightning. 

That is, the word will not be able to be hindered, it will 
run quickly and break through, like the lightning from the 
exit to the setting of the sun, without anyone being able 
to hinder it, runs and shines. Therefore, no one will be 
able to stop the effectiveness and the course of the word. 


And the LORD HEART will blow the trumpet. 


That is, let the gospel resound. 


And will step in closer than the weather of noon. 

The storm from the noon region is the strongest of all, 
through it, therefore, it indicates the power of the 
preached gospel, that is, the word will go forth with great 
power, it will seize the Gentiles as with a whirlwind and 
weather, and thus humble and strike down the captured 
peoples, so that it may make alive and blessed those 
who were thus first killed and damned, for this is the way 
of the Holy Spirit in the conversion of the ungodly. 


V. 15. the LORD of hosts will protect them, that 
they may devour 2c. 


The prophet takes pleasure in a lovely desire for 
images and figurative speeches, through all of which he 
describes the power of the preached gospel and praises 
its glory and honor. But he indicates that the ministers of 
the word are exposed to many dangers in persecution, 
destined to the slaughter, as it is said in the Psalm [Ps. 
44, 23.]. They are prisoners in hope [v. 12.], therefore 
they need the protection of the Lord, and he also protects 
them, as he says [Matt. 10, 30.]: "The very hairs of your 
head are all numbered." Likewise [Zech. 2:8], "He that 
toucheth you toucheth the apple of mine eye." He not 
only protects the body, but when the body is killed, he 
causes the word to be strong and to stand against Satan 
and all adversaries, which is to his glory. 


2094 L. xxvni, isi-i34. Interpretations on the prophets.

That they eat and bring under themselves with sling 
stones. 


That is, they will bite and punish sinners, as Christ 
says [John 16:8], "The Holy Spirit will punish the world 
for sin." Then they will devour those thus killed, that is, 
incorporate them by faith in the gospel. The same is 
what he says here of the "sling stones," as if to say, 
"They shall hurl my gospel among the Gentiles, and shall 
hit, and their preaching shall be effectual. 


That they drink and rumble as from wine. 


Inebriabuntur or rumor. He indicates with all this the 
happy progress of the Gospel among the Gentiles, that 
is, they will rejoice over the conversion of the Gentiles, 
as a drinker of wine rejoices when he drinks to the 
sufficiency and cheerfulness. 


And become full as the basin, and as the corners of 
the altar. 
This is another image, which is taken from the 


"basins" (phialis) (but phiala is "a bowl"), which were 
used at the sacrifices for the wine and the blood of the 
sacrificed animals, as if he wanted to say: They will have 
their play with the Gentiles, as the priests had their play 
with the basins and other sacrificial devices, they will 
sacrifice and slay the Gentiles by their preaching. And 
this is what Paul says [Rom. 15, 16]: 1) "I offer the 
gospel, that the Gentiles may become a sacrifice 
acceptable to God", as if he wanted to say: Through the 
gospel | sacrifice the Gentiles, and thus | cause the 
Gentiles thus sacrificed to become an acceptable 
sacrifice to the Lord. Thus all preachers of the Word 
sacrifice sinners and the ungodly to the Lord, killing them 
with the Word and driving them to despair, so that they 
may turn to righteousness. Thus the apostle Paul was 
full of the blood of many Gentiles. And here the prophet 
has explained with this One Word the reason of all the 
sacrifices of the Old Testament, namely what all of them 
aim at and what they go for, namely the ministry of the 
Word. -

V. 16. And the LORD their God will help them at that

That is, this alone is the way to salvation; there is no 
other salvation to be expected, but it will happen through 
the word of the gospel, of which we are now speaking. But 
its revelation will take place; now only the prelude is given 
with all these things until salvation is made known. Thus 
the prophet uses many and various images, which are quite 
harsh in our language, but very appropriate in the Hebrew 
language, since the Jewish people had the use of sacrifices; 
and therefore they could easily take images from there, 
which we cannot. But the imagery of eating and drinking, 
which he here commemorates, is common among other 
peoples. So also in Job [Cap. 5, 5.] it is said, "His goods 
shall the mighty ones sow." Likewise in the Psalm [Ps. 79, 
7.], "They have eaten up Jacob." Likewise [Ps. 14, 4.]: 
"They devour my people" 2c., that is, they have sucked 
them dry, flayed them, for so also the Latins say: 


Exhausti sunt toti etc.. 


Like a herd (oves) of his people. 

Christ and the apostles considered this prophet very 
well. For they use many words that are taken from this 
prophet and also quote some passages from it here and 
there. Thus Christ has everywhere the word "sheep" in 
his mouth, since he calls the Christians his sheep. 


For holy stones will be set up in his land. 


The use of the Nazarene is known from the sixth 
chapter of the fourth book of Moses, how the Nazarene 
were sanctified to the Lord, how they never shaved 
themselves and went bareheaded 2c. And this use is 
called in Hebrew Neser [XXX]; this word we have given 
in the German translation by "Zucht". But it was a 
voluntary abstinence in which they served God, lest they 
should fall into idolatry, since it pleased them to be in 
such spirituality. And on this custom of the Nazarene, 
yes, on all sacrifices, meals, feasts, in short, on all 
ceremonies of the law plays. 


2096 L- xxvm, 134-136. Interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 9, 16. 17. 


2097 





Here, the prophet refers to the spiritual interpretation of 
everything to Christ, which is also done by the true 
preachers of the word and the apostles. For this is what 
the apostle Paul [1 Cor. 3:12] calls building gold and 
silver and precious stones on this foundation. The 
apostle Paul did the same in the letter to the Galatians, 
where he interprets the story of the two brothers Ishmael 
and Isaac according to the spiritual interpretation, in the 
fourth chapter of the letter to the Galatians [v. 22. ff]. 
Thus the prophet speaks here with many dark images 
and figures of Christ, although he acted above with quite 
clear and distinct words the same. Therefore the 


consecrated stones (Nazare1) are the apostles and 
preachers of the gospel, of whom he says that they shall 
be set up in his country. But the Hebrew word does not 
actually mean to raise up, but here it means to be raised 
up, as a sign or flag is raised up in war, as is clearly seen 
in the second book of Moses [Cap. 17, 15.] at the 
building of the altar, where Moses adds: "And called him, 
The HErr Nissi" [XXX ---- my panier], that is, my standard 
or sign of war, which attracts the eyes of those who look. 
Thus he calls the apostles and ministers of the Word 


consecrated stones (lapides Nazareos), which should 
be erected like a banner, that is, that the apostles and 
preachers of the Word should be the foundation of the 
Church, but consecrated and sanctified to the Lord like 
the Nazarenes, that is, completely pure they should 
teach the Gospel and the faith, not staining it with human 
doctrines, and not mixing in the leaven of the hypocrites. 
Such were the apostles, as Zechariah prophesies about 
them. 

"They shall be raised up," namely, by the Holy Spirit, in 
the land as a guide and as a banner to which the hearers 
of the Gospel looked. For wherever the Gospel is 
preached, there is a struggle; the world and Christ 
cannot come to an agreement. Therefore, they fight, and 
the godly who trust in the writings of the apostles sit 
down against the enemies of godliness and shut them 
up. This is how the Holy Spirit does great things when 
faithful preachers of the gospel are given, 





Who do not seek their own, do not seek the favor of 
others, do not seek riches and honor, but only seek to 
win for Christ [1 Cor. 9:19], and to give back the received 
pound with very rich usury; and thus they alone are 
consecrated and sanctified to Christ. Then they are right 
Nazarenes, since they teach the gospel of Christ purely, 
without admixture of their dreams and human doctrines, 
as follows. Here one can see a wonderful consequence 
and reason of the foregoing. He says [v. 15.], "The 
LORD their GOD will help at that time," 2c. "For holy 


stones (lapides nezer) will be raised up" 2c. But the 
prophet goes on to indicate in what way or how he will 
help, namely through the word, that is, through the 
sending of the apostles who are to preach Christ. 
Through their preaching, those are to be drawn to Christ 
in whom the gospel is effective. Only they must be 
stones of the Lord, that is, consecrated to the Lord, only 
they must teach the gospel truthfully, otherwise they are 
not stones of the Lord. 


V. 17. for what good do they have above 
others? 2c. 

This passage has been extremely badly twisted to the 
sacrament of the Holy Communion, which comes from 
the fact that here the grain and the wine are mentioned. 
Namely, so great has been the intolerable drowsiness of 
the sacred writers, whereas it would have befitted them 
to be extremely vigilant and careful 2c. Jerome with his 
Jews accuses the seventy interpreters of ignorance 


because they translated: frumentum juvenum et 
mustum 2c. But I hold that Jerome translated 
badly, and subscribe to the Septuagint translation and 
read [instead of] frumentum electorum et vinum 


germinans virgines [in the Vulgate, frumentum 


juvenum et mustum germinans etc.]. 1) It is 
therefore the opinion of the passage: Christ will save his 
people, not by armies of war, not by bodily armor, not by 
martial impetuosity, but by beauty and 


1) Without this addition made by us, the passage seems 
meaningless to us. The Zwickau manuscript agrees with us. - Instead 
of mustuna we have put vinum according to the Vulgate.

lovely being, not by the cruel weapons, but by 
adornment and beauty, as it is said in the Psalm [Ps. 45, 
5.].And this he calls here grain and wine, namely, by the 
gospel, which is Christ's highest honor and adornment, 
by which the hearts are attracted, which taste this 
sweetness of the gospel. For the gospel is the light and 
splendor in which Christ is glorified, so that the psalms 
call it praise, praise, splendor, adornment, beauty, and 
a thousand other names when they describe the 
adornment of Christ. This gospel, he says, will be 
something lovely, namely, through it he will beget for 
himself strong young men and virgins, not helpless little 
children, as they are born of weak carnal procreation, 
but they will be born immediately. 


strong young men and beautiful virgins, as manly virgins 
and young men tend to be when they are in their prime, 
so that this birth will be wonderful. In short, it indicates 
that the people of the gospel will be strong, lively and 
joyful in spirit and faith. For in Christ there is not old age, 
but a constant blossoming of youth, not the sad old age, 
which begins to be troubled by various sorrows, which 
also happens to those who have come out of youth and 
have reached the right manly age. Youthful age does not 
have all this, which makes the hearts of young people 
free, lively and free from all sadness and sorrow; and so 
are the girls who are still in their prime 2c. 


The tenth chapter. 


The prophet continues to play with secret 
interpretations, images and figures as he had started. 
But this whole passage is quoted almost verbatim in 
Matthew Cap. 9, 1) 36, where he describes the 
preaching of Christ in Galilee. This whole passage has 
to do with a dispute. For he distinguishes between the 
right preachers and the right word of God and the 
hypocrites and false teachers, who are not "stones 


nezer", but speak what their heart tells them (Visionem 
cordis sui). It is therefore the opinion: 


V. 1. Ask therefore for the Lord's sparring rain. 


There is an emphasis on the word "LORD" as if to 
say, "Keep yourselves to the LORD," and beware of the 
leaven of the Pharisees, lest they deceive you with the 
appearance of what is right, and lead you astray, not 
unlike sheep that are without a shepherd, as has 
happened. For all things were mixed with human 
statutes and Pharisaic leaven when Christ came. 


1) Set by us instead of: c "p. 4. 


Scripture everywhere remembers a twofold rain, 
which is abundantly spoken of elsewhere. The first is 
that by which the earth is fertilized, that it may receive 
the seed; then the other is that by which the drought is 
kept away, after it has already received the seed, that 
the seed may be watered, that it may not wither 2c. The 
first rain was the teaching of the law, as if to say, You 
have prophets among you who press and oppress you 
with the law alone as with a driver. This is hard for you 
to bear, so | advise you something else: that you depart 
from the law and ask for the rain. "Keep to the grain that 
begets young men and to the must that begets virgins, 
and your consciences will be straightened when the 
tyranny of the law is over. As lukewarm as you fear 
these, you cannot but stand in fear and be weighed 
down by the greatest burden. Thus he speaks in the 
manner of a hater, as | have said. 


So the Lord will make clouds and give you rain 
enough.

actually 

grammarians are not yet in agreement. But it is used 
three times in the whole Scripture: twice in Job, namely 
in the 28th and in the 38th chapter, 2) and here in 
Zechariah. The seventy interpreters have translated: 


phantasias. It seems to me to designate entirely the 
weather that tends to occur in spring, when winter is just 
over, because the earth is shaken by exceedingly strong 
thunder, for it is said that this benefits the earth and the 
seeds. For it is said that through this shaking the earth is 
opened and becomes fertile. Therefore, this is my 
opinion, as if he wanted to say: If you will ask the Lord 
for rain in this way, he will give you abundant yield. He 
will give you more than you ask, for he will give an 
abundant, rich, and great rain with spring thunderstorms, 
whereby the earth tends to become fruitful. "To every 
crop in the field." That is, wherever the Gospel is asked 
for, it will be preached, and not without exceedingly great 
success; it will bear very abundant fruit. 


V. 2. For the idols speak vain trouble. 

Through various images he describes the false 
teachers as he described the right preachers of Christ 
above. But he calls the false teachers: idols, 
soothsayers, liars, dreamers 2c. 


5) And talk vain dreams (Somniatores). 

That is, they are busy with dreams and foolish 
images. Jude in his epistle [v. 8.] also calls them 
"dreamers." For with all their preaching they associate

dreams, prescribing works by which they deceive the 
"imprudent," and wanting to comfort the wretched 
consciences by adding that such works would be fully 
approved by God, and in this way promising the favor of 
God. And so they corrupt the souls by a deceptive 
promise, about which they themselves are not even 
certain, which brings ruin to the souls, as he adds: 


Therefore they go astray like a flock, and are faint 
because there is no shepherd. 


It does not indicate a common or bad dispersion, but 
one in which every sheep seeks pasture in some way 
when the shepherd is gone. Then it happens that the 
sheep, wandering here and there like this, pine away 
and perish. It is quite the same opinion in clear words, 
without pictures, in the words of Isaiah [Cap. 53, 6.]: "We 
all went astray like sheep, every one looking to his way." 
This had to be written by the prophets necessarily darkly 
and with flowery words, otherwise, if he had said it 
clearly that they would have understood it, he would 
have been without doubt in danger of his life, because 
he would have connected and preached the rejection 
and blindness of the people at the same time with the re- 
acceptance and restoration. Then the prophet had 
come, he had been sent, to comfort and encourage the 
afflicted and most miserably oppressed people, that they 
should continue to build the temple, that the Lord would 
help them and give prosperity to the work begun, that 
the Lord would finally send the king who was promised 
to the fathers 2c. Therefore, if he had connected these 
comforts and promises with obvious threats that they 
understood, he would have deterred them from their 
undertaking, so that they would not have continued in 
the building of the temple. That is why he spoke the 
threats and the wrath of God in obscure words, so that 
those who should understand it would finally understand 
it. Among the number of these people were also the 
apostles and all those who were converted to Christ from 
among the Jews, and we from among the Gentiles who 
believe the gospel that promises forgiveness of sins in 
Christ 2c. 


2102 XXVIII, 140-142. 


Interpretations on the prophets. 


2103 





V. 3. 1) My wrath is kindled against the shepherds. 


The meaning is not complicated, but the 
consideration of grammar troubles us a bit, and it is the 
opinion: the shepherds only scatter the flock, do not feed 
them, are a ruin to the souls, they are troublesome idols 
and soothsayers, only present their dreams. They are 
not antlers of the 
Lord. Therefore | am angry with them, | will punish them. 


And | want to haunt the goats. 


This passage is also well known in Matthew, as he 
says [MaUh.25, 32,], "He will separate the sheep from 
the goats."-So here he calls these vile teachers "goats" 
who only flay the flock. A similar passage is found in 
Ezekiel Cap. 34, 11: "| myself will take care of my flock 
and seek them." So he says here, the LORD himself will 
visit his flock, the house of Judah, the LORD himself will 
finally come, feed them and bring them back from error 
2c. 


And will prepare them like a decorated horse for 
battle. 


He repeats the previous vision, which he described in 
the sixth chapter, of the horses sent out for Jerusalem. 
But he speaks figuratively. Above in the ninth chapter [v. 
10] he said that he would cut off the horses and chariots 
from Judah, where he described the spiritual kingdom of 
Christ. Here he says he will accept Judah "as a horse 
adorned for battle." These two pieces seem to argue 
against each other. But here you must be reminded 
again of what we have already reminded you above, that 
it must be very well observed in the Scriptures that the 
preceding words are always stronger, to which what 
comes after is referred, likewise that what is simply said 
without all images and without darkness of the words, 
interprets what is said with images in the words and 
flowery speeches, so that by all means the clear 
understanding of the word, in which nothing is figurative, 


1) Here the Weimar edition has the verse number "4." and so on, one 
number too high, until v. 6. where the verse number is "7.", and only 
at v. 7. is it back in order. 





is the more excellent. This should be known to the 
prophets of our time, who cry out and make such a great 
noise, and think that they have won the palm against us, 
if they can bring forward any dark passage against us, 
while in the meantime they set aside many passages 
which, without a darkness of imagery, quite simply and 
clearly say the same thing, or the opposite. Thus it 
comes about that with them the Scripture never remains 
the same as itself. We must therefore do the same here, 
that we compare what is said darkly with images with 
what is said without images and simply, so that it cannot 
be taken differently. But here it is a picture. "! will prepare 
them," namely, the apostles and my elect, who will 
believe the gospel, "like adorned horses for war," "like an 
adorned beautiful horse," and like a horse in triumph, 
which is adorned with blankets, with humps, and every 
kind of the most beautiful ornament. For this is what the 


word las denotes, as | also reminded above. He 
therefore speaks of a spiritual horse and a spiritual 
battle, in which he treads down the heathen by the 
preaching of the gospel, by the preaching of the apostles 
and other preachers of the word. For they are adorned 
horses, that is, full of the Holy Spirit, they break through 
with their preaching that it is effective, even if all 
creatures oppose it. This also includes what follows, 
which cannot be taken as the letter reads. 


V. 4, the corners, nails. 


He indicates that the people of the Jews should not 
be completely rejected, some remnants would be 
preserved. The same opinion is expressed in Isaiah 
[Cap. 10, 20. f.) in clear words: "The remnant of Israel 
will turn to the LORD their God." The prophet expresses 
this clear saying here darkly and in images, from the 
corners, nails 2c. But it is a Hebrew way of speaking, 
which Ezra also used in a prayer [Ezra 9, 8.]: Preserve 
us, O LORD, the fence in Jerusalem and the nail at the 
house of the LORD. The same is said here, as if he 
wanted to say: Although the others cling to their 
dreamers and wolves, who are only there- 


2104 D- XXVIII, 142-144. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 10, 4. 5. 


2105 





| will preserve only one corner after almost the whole of 
Halls, namely Israel and Judah, has been rejected, and 
from this preserved corner | will build a new house for 
myself, that is, the church. | will let the scattered people, 
overwhelmed with error and sunk in it, go astray. | will 
save a few, who will be a nail for me, on which | will hang 
many glorious devices and ornaments, as it is said in 
Isaiah [Cap. 22, 23. f.], that is, these my priests and 
preachers, whom | have chosen, will be followed by 
many believers, they will cause many to be converted to 
the gospel, so that the splendor, ornament and 
adornment of my house will become greater. Thus Paul 
the apostle is a very special nail of Christ in the church, 
on which many glorious devices were hung, Timothy, 
Titus, Apollo 2c.; so also Peter. 


Arc of dispute. 
That is, | will subjugate many nations by the preaching of 


the gospel, to which | will use them as a marksman uses 
his bow. 


And all drivers. 


That is, all teachers of the law who only burden and 
oppress the consciences by the revelation of the law. For 
this is how Isaiah Cap. 9, 4. calls the law: "the rod of the 
driver". 


V. 5. and yet shall be like the giants (fortes). 


The Hebrew word [for fortes] is a beautiful one. But it 
means a hero or a giant, which is clear from the 19th 
Psalm, v. 6: "She rejoices like a hero." Likewise Ps. 45, 
4. "Gird up thy sword at thy side, thou hero," where we 


read [in the Vulgate]: potentissime. But it is the same 
opinion, which was above Cap. 9, 17., of the grain that 
begets young men, and of the must that begets virgins. 
As if he wanted to say: They will not be little children or 
weak, but heroes and strong giants, excellent warriors, 
so that they can easily trample on anything. So 
marvelous, he says, will be the heroes who do not fight 
with weapons, not with 





They have their strength in the feet, in the going in. With 
the trampling the prophet shows nothing else than the 
office of the word, which is compared everywhere in the 
Scriptures with the feet and the walk. For it runs the word 
of God 2c. In short, they will rule and subdue the necks 
of the proud work saints, the saints and scholars of this 
world, for these he calls "dung". For through the gospel it 
is preached that our wisdom, righteousness, holiness, 
powers and authority, in short, all that is in us is 
condemned and good for nothing but to be trodden under 
foot, but righteousness, wisdom and blessedness are 
presented and offered to us in Christ alone. This alone 
was made for us by God for our sanctification and 
redemption 2c. Therefore, when the human heart hears 
and grasps this sermon, it immediately considers all its 
righteousness as dirt, as Paul also says [Phil. 3, 8], 
because everything that does not come from faith is sin 
[Rom. 14, 23]. But we read evil in our “Latin] translation 


s: conculcantes lutum viarum], but it should be read 
thus: They shall be trodden down as the dung in the 
streets 2c. 


And shall contend, for the LORD shall be with them. 


This is the interpretation of that fierce quarrel and the 
happy trampling, as if he wanted to say: They will wage 
such a war, not by force of arms, but in a new way of war, 
namely by the presence of the LORD. This is what Paul 
says in the Epistle to the Corinthians [1 Cor. 3, 7.], "So 
then neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, 
but GOD who gives the flourishing." Thus the apostles 
planted by their preaching, but the LORD put their word 
into the hearts of the hearers, and so in the power of the 
Spirit, which the LORD added to the word, they trampled 
down all that was exceeding strong and wise in the world. 


That the horses become disgraced. 


That is, he will not need any horsemen, no clash of 
arms, but the Lord will only by the Spirit direct this 
wonderful battle of his through his new giants 2c.

V. 6. And | will strengthen the house of Judah, and 
save the house of Joseph. 

Above we have heard several times about the eternal 
condemnation of the kingdom of Israel, that the kingdom 
of Israel has not been restored, nor should it be restored. 
But the kingdom of Judah was restored, but a few 
remnants were the beginning of this restoration; and this 
was done for the sake of the future kingdom of Christ. 
But here he says that he wants to strengthen and save 
both Judah and Israel (because under the name of the 
house of Joseph the kingdom of Israel comes in). It can 
be seen that these two things are clearly in conflict with 
each other, if what is said here is not related to a spiritual 
acceptance and return, namely, that the gospel is 
preached in all parts of the world, which reconciled many 
of Israel to God who believed. But the eternal rejection 
refers to the outward rejection of the kingdom and the 
priesthood, that Israel has not been restored, the 
kingdom has not been restored, the former glory has not 
been restored. Therefore, what follows proves that this 
passage must be understood of spiritual conversion. 
"For | have mercy on them," | forgive and remit their sin, 
so it comes to pass that they please me, that they are 
accepted of me 2c. But what we read: "I will strengthen 
the house of Judah"- that reads in the Hebrew more 
emphatically: | will make that Judah has the upper hand 


(praevaleat) or: that it rules over everything. So the 
same word is Gen. 7, 18: "The waters of the flood of sin 


prevailed" (praevalebant), that is, it went over 
everything. 
And shall be as they were. 

This does not indicate the manner of the restored 
people, but wants this, as if to say: Just as they were in 
grace, as they had a gracious and reconciled God before 
they were rejected, so also then they will have a 
gracious and favorable God and a kind Father who will 
save and protect them 2c. 


For I, the LORD, their God, will hear them. 
That is, of such a nature will be the mercy and its 
conversion, that | will be 





| am their God who wants to hear them. In this word the 
ministry of the whole kingdom of Christ and the sum of 
Christianity is understood. As if he wanted to say: They 
will pray, but | will hear those who pray. For this is the 
main part and the summa of the kingdom of Christ: to 
pray and to be heard. For in the name "prayer" is also 
included the preaching and praising of God, namely, that 
we preach the word of the Gospel, by which the 
goodness and grace of God in Christ are adorned and 
praised. Then, that we should pray. For we are 
constantly attacked by the devil, by sin, by the world and 
by our flesh, we are daily oppressed by many evils, 
therefore we always need to pray that God's name may 
be sanctified, that the word of God may bear fruit and 
that the kingdom of Christ may be planted. This is the 
whole life of a Christian before God, as Paul also teaches 
everywhere. 


V. 7. And Ephraim shall be like a giant. 

One has to look carefully at the intention of the 
prophet, where he is going and where he is, namely in 
the description of the kingdom of Christ. He explicitly 
uses a simile to indicate that he is speaking figuratively, 
so that the Jews would not imagine that a fleshly and 
physical kingdom and strength is promised. For he says 
thus, "It shall be like a giant," as if to say, They shall not 
be sneezers or heroes in the flesh (for it is the same word 
here as above), but in the spirit, namely, by the power of 
the Spirit through the word of the gospel. Thus they will 
be exceedingly strong, so that no one can overcome 
them, but they themselves will overcome all, even 
though they are now scattered and thrown away by the 
Medes and Syrians 2c. 


And her heart shall be merry as from wine. 

That is, they will have a safe and happy conscience 
before God, the law and sin will no longer be able to 
frighten and condemn them, but they will believe that sin 
is forgiven them and grace and salvation are given in 
Christ, as he adds here: 


2108 D- XXVIII, 14S-149. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 10, 7-9. 


2109 





That her heart may rejoice in the Lord. 


As if to say, not in their wisdom and righteousness will 
their justice lie. 


V. 8. 1) | will blow to them and gather them. 


This is a dainty way of speaking or a special way of 
speaking the Hebrew language. It means to blow on, to 
breathe on, to move the heart and mind of someone. It is 
also found in Isaiah [Cap. 7, 18.]: "For at that time the 
Lord will swish the fly at the end of the waters in Egypt," 
that is, he will move with his spirit, he will do a blowing, 
as it is said elsewhere. It is therefore the opinion of this 
passage: | will blow, | will encourage, and | will move 
them to attack the thing cheerfully. | will not give them 
many laws by which they are to be restrained and 
compelled; they will not be hypocrites, but will willingly 
and gladly preside over the ministry of the word, for 
Christians are a willing people. In short, through the word 
| will send my spirit into them, which will move them and 
make them lively and brave, and so | will gather them, 
namely to the unity of faith. 


For | will redeem them. 
Here is an exceedingly sweet sound by which hearts are 
made glad, namely, when they hear that Christ died for 
our sins and was sufficient to transfer us from the 
kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of clarity of the 
Son of God [Col. 1:13], that we have become fellow heirs 
with Christ 2c. 


And shall multiply. 


He explains this multiplication by adding [v. 9], "I will sow 
them among the nations." Everywhere he opposes the 
carnal thoughts of the Jews. For the Jews thought thus: 
that all should be gathered into the land of Canaan, from 
which they had been cast out by God's judgment. But the 
prophet describes a wonderful gathering and 
multiplication, namely, that they should be sown among 
all nations, in the farthest parts of the earth.

of the world. This passage cannot be understood by 
fleshly increase, because it is quite clear, so that the 
prophet tears us completely out of the covers of the 
Jewish errors. But this sowing must be taken in a good 
sense. Thus Peter, Paul and the other apostles are this 
seed and the grains that are thrown among the nations, 
so that they preach the word and win the people for the 
Lord through the gospel [1 Cor. 9:21]. 


V. 9.3) That they may remember me in far-off lands. 


Et de longe recordabuntur mei, so we read 
badly [in the Vulgate], just as this passage is also badly 
torn apart by distinctive signs. But read thus: And among 
distant people they will remember me. It is, as | have 
said, a wonderful collection, which does not at all agree 
with the falsely preconceived opinion of the Jews. But it 
is the opinion: They will remember me among distant 
people, that is, they will preach me, they will adorn me 
with praise through the gospel and spread me among all 
the Gentiles. For so the Scripture uses the word 
"remember," as Christ also says, "Do these things in 
remembrance of me." Therefore, this passage must be 
understood of the preaching of the Gospel by the 
apostles throughout the world, and of the gathering into 
the Church of Christ by faith. The same is said in the 87th 
Psalm, v. 4: "Behold, the Philistines and the Tyrians with 
the Moors are born there." And Isa. 60, 4: "Thy sons shall 
come from afar." 


And shall live with their children and come again. 

That is, they will be at ease, not grieving as in the 
previous captivity, not weighed down by misfortune, but 
rejoicing and returning with their children. For this is what 
"to live" means: to have it good. That is, in the midst of 
death, sin and hell, they will live by faith, no creature can 
separate them from the love of God, they will be subject 
to the devil and the gates of hell.

2110 XXVIII, 119 f.' Interpretations on the Prophets. 


V. 10. 1) For | will bring them again from the land of 
Egypt. 


Alis your preceding part and from what follows, it is 
quite clear that the prophet speaks of the spiritual return, 
because he adds: "And will gather them out of Assyria, 
and will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon", 
as if he wanted to say: not to Jerusalem or to Mount Zion, 
which they might mean, but to Gilead, which was the first 
part of the holy land at midnight, but Lebanon the last. 
By this inconsistent thing he indicates that he is speaking 
of the spiritual restoration, because the Jews clearly 
knew that their captives were to be returned to 
Jerusalem, and not to Lebanon or to Gilead. Therefore 
the opinion is: There will be many Christians fine 
everywhere in the whole world. Quite the same opinion 
and the same teaching is at the end of Obadiah [v. 19.], 
"And they that are toward the south shall possess the 
mountain of Esau. "2c. Jerome testifies that at the time 
of the first church there were many and excellent 
Christians in the borders of Arabia. 


That one will not find Ranm for them. 


As if he wanted to say: There will be so many that one 
place cannot contain them all, but they will be sown 
among distant dwellers over the whole earth. This is 
what Christ says [Joh. 4, 21.]: 2) "The time is coming that 
neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship 
the Father" 2c. 


V. 11. And he will pass through the sea of fear. 


Fretum he calls the narrows and [as it were] the 
gullet of the sea, where it is very narrowed and 
constricted, and made narrow like the neck of the body, 
and then again spreads out far and wide in an immense 
and immeasurable area.

and extended as the hellespont is 2c. It indicates that the 
gospel is to be preached also among the Greeks. 


And the waves crash in the sea. 


He imitates the Psalm [Ps. 65, 8, Vulg.]: "You who stir 
up the depth of the sea and the roar of its waves" 2c., as 
if he wanted to say: He will strike those who dwell on the 
bright spit and in the sea cities and also the waves of the 
sea, that is, the tyrants who are lords in the sea cities, 
who seize power and persecute the gospel. He will 
convert them so that their hearts will change, and those 
who just before bitterly hated the gospel and the 
preachers of the gospel will become friends. 


That all the depths of the water will dry up. That is, the 
great, the tyrants, the wise, the righteous and the 
powerful, with whom the supremacy stands. 


Then the splendor of Assyria shall be humbled. 4) 


The prophet wanders through the whole world. First 
he thought of Egypt, then of Greece, here he comes to 
Assyria, in order to indicate the course and the progress 
of the gospel through the whole world, to all peoples. 


And the scepter in Egypt shall cease. 

That is, no driver, no tyranny of laws will plague the 
Christians anymore; no one will rule over them, because 
he alone is the Lord who takes the heart of the 
Christians; everything else has no right over any 
Christian. 


V. 12. 5) | will strengthen them in the Lord. 


Again he adds this with necessity, as if to say: Strong 
they will be, not in their strength, but in Christ, in whose 
name they will walk, that is, they will believe and live in 
the faith that clings to Christ.

2113 





The eleventh chanter. 


So far the prophet has predicted the future kingdom 
of Christ and what fruit the gospel to be spread in the 
world by the apostles would bring, namely that the 
Gentiles should be converted to the faith. But it was 
known and all the prophets were well aware that the 
external kingdom of the Jews would finally end. When 
Christ came, it would have to give way to the new King 
Christ, so that he could establish his new kingdom, in 
which he would rule from sea to sea and to the ends of 
the earth. But because there was an insurmountable 
stubbornness in the people of the Jews, they did not 
want to give way to their new king, therefore they were 
forced to give way, and both the kingdom and the 
priesthood were devastated, and they themselves were 
pushed out in the most miserable way and excluded from 
the kingdom of Christ, since hardly a few remnants have 
been preserved. 

The prophet will do the same in this chapter, but with 
extraordinarily dark and complicated words, because 
besides the fact that the prophet in this chapter is already 
dark enough in itself, the various explanations of the 
interpreters still increase this darkness. And when we 
have wriggled out of this chapter, | believe that we have 
overcome everything that is hidden and difficult to 
explain in this prophet. 


V. 1. Open your door, Lebanon. 


Here he calls the temple in Jerusalem "Lebanon". 
This people had, as far as external things were 
concerned, nothing more sublime and holy than this 
temple. He calls it "Lebanon" because it was built of the 
cedars of Lebanon, as is clear from Ezra. By 
interchanging the words (per LETOVDLtAD) he calls 
he the temple Lebanon to obscure the prophecy of the 
desolation of the temple by the Romans. This figure of 
speech or metaphor is also agreeable to the Latins. For 
he calls the temple "Lebanon," indicating that much 
material from Lebanon was found in the tem 





pel, and that the largest part of the temple consisted of 
the wood of Lebanon, as we could say the same of the 
Harz Mountains 2c. But he speaks in the form of a 
command, and yet he indicates that it is still future. As if 
he wanted to say: The temple, which is now built and 
preserved and protected, will finally, when Christ comes, 
be opened, abandoned and desolated, the entrance will 
be open to the Roman enemies; no power will be 
sufficient to keep the enemies from breaking through. 


That the fire may consume your cedars. 
That is, with fire your buildings will be devastated. 


V. 2.') Hay, ye firs, for the cedars 
have fallen. 


For the sake of the people he addresses lifeless 
things. Because he indicates the mourning of the people, 
because of the desolation of the temple. 


And the magnificent building is destroyed. 


That is, the glorious and most precious ornaments of 
the temple. For there was a glorious adornment of the 
temple, which | also reminded above, and the most 
delicious gifts of votive offerings, so that even the 
disciples of Christ were amazed at the building of the 
temple. The passage in the Gospel story [Marc. 13, 1.]is 
well known. 


Hail, O oaks of Basan. 


"Bashan" is the land of the king at Og, beyond the 
Jordan. Afterwards it was called Gilead and Manasseh. 
This place in the land of Canaan is excellent and full of 
oaks, which is clear from Isaiah [Cap. 2, 13.]: "The day 
of the LORD of hosts will pass over all the oaks in 
Bashan." And to these oaks the prophet also speaks 
here, which had been taken away from there to be used 
for the bari of the temple.

2115 





Because the solid forest is knocked down. 


Again he describes the desolation of the temple. He 
calls about the temple "a solid forest", as he called it 
Lebanon above with regard to the various buildings, to 
the splendor of the beams and the columns of the 
temple. 


V. 3: The shepherds are heard howling. 


This is a Hebrew way of speaking. But the opinion is: 
When the temple will be destroyed and also the city will 
be devastated, then the howling of the shepherds will be 
heard, that is, the rulers and scribes who have the rule 
in their hands, because both the kingdom and the 
priesthood will perish, and all the splendor of the temple 
and the city will perish by fire. 


Hear the lions roar. 


The Hebrews call the rich and powerful by the name: 
young lions, which also appears from the Psalm [Ps. 34, 
11.], where we read: "The rich must live in want and 
hunger"; in the Hebrew it is written: The young lions 2c. 


For the splendor of the Jordan is destroyed. 


The Hebrew word actually denotes the sublimity, as 
in the song of Moses [2 Mos. 15, 1.]: "The Lord has done 
a glorious deed", that is, he has shown himself to be 
exceedingly glorious, he is exalted above all, "he goes 
up high". So it indicates glory or exaltation here also. 
"Jordan," however, he calls the people, since in this land 
the Jordan River is the most distinguished and the king 
before the others. For the Hebrew language has a way 
of naming, after an eminent mountain and a more 
eminent river, the people or the land in which either this 
river flows or the mountain is, as in the Psalm [Ps. 42:7.], 
"| remember thee in the land of Jordan and Hermonim, 
in the little mountain." Such images are quite pleasant 
and understandable to the Jews, however dark they may 
be to us. The summa of this passage is: It will destroy 
and annihilate the glory of this kingdom, which is at 
Jordan. 





V. 4, Thus says the LORD my GOD: Shepherd the 
sheep of the slaughter. 


After describing the disturbance of the kingdom, he 
now continues in a new sermon and describes their guilt 
by which they have earned this disturbance. However, 
this chapter is difficult and even dark, which | also 
reminded in the beginning, and | struggled a lot to get the 
right opinion. Lyra refers it to continuous history, which | 
do not approve of; for in explaining the prophets, we must 
be absolutely careful not to make historians out of them, 
unless there is a clear reason and necessity that compels 
us to do so. Therefore this is my opinion: He throws the 
whole blame of the disturbance on the godless teachers 
and scribes, who misused the office of the word in the 
most shameful way to serve their lusts, their indulgence 
and their avarice. For avarice reigned among the 
Pharisees when Christ came as the right shepherd and 
king. That is why they scorned and despised Christ when 
he taught, but served their own interests. Therefore, this 
whole chapter must be referred to the time of Christ and 
the apostles, and it must not be twisted elsewhere. 
Because if you understand it differently, everything does 
not fit. 

Now here is the commandment of the Father, by 
which Christ is commanded to administer his ministry 
bravely, that he preach the word, as if he wanted to say: 
Christ, preach among this wretched people, among 
whom nothing else prevails but slaughter, that is, error 
and destruction of souls, because he speaks of spiritual 
slaughter, which happens through the godless teaching 
of the godless teachers. This is quite clear from what 
follows, and this is also clearly indicated by the evangelist 
Matthew, when he describes how Christ went about 
Galilee and lamented to him of the people, because they 
went astray without shepherds 2c. 


V. 5. 1) For their masters slay them (Quae qui 
possederant). 


He calls them "owners" to indicate the tyranny of the 
chief priests and scribes, that they rage according to their 
will against

2117 





corrupt the subjects and both the souls and the bodies 
and goods, no differently than if they were commanded 
to rule and were not rather servants. 


And holding for no sin. 


That is, surely they spoil the souls, also fear nothing 
for themselves. There is a very similar passage Ezek. 
34, 2. ff. 


Sell them. 


This is what Ezekiel says [Cap. 13, 18. f.]: "When you 
have captured the souls among my people, you promise 
them life, and desecrate me among my people for a 
handful of barley and morsels of bread, so that you 
condemn the souls to death" 2c. That is, for the sake of 
their belly, they deliver the souls into the pit of hell. 


And say: Praise be to the Lord, | am now rich. 


The prophet indicates a common word, which the 
godless teachers have used, because they think that 
they are also gods pleasant 1), and because of their 
righteousness the riches and honors flow to them, and 
so they cover their godlessness with the name of God. 
Also Isaiah attacks the avarice of the false teachers 
[Cap. 5, 8.]: "Woe to those who draw one house upon 
another, and bring one field to the ground, until there is 
no room left." 


And their shepherds do not spare them. 


That is, moved by no emotion of compassion, they 
only flay. They spoil both the souls and the possessions 
of their subjects, so insatiable greed has taken hold of 
them that there is no measure of robbery. The belly is so 
insatiable, as Solomon says [Proverbs 13:25]. We see 
this also in our popes and bishops, how they have 
amassed riches 2c. 


V. 6. Therefore | will not spare any more. 


Here he now starts the threat by which he explains 
the preceding, in which he 


1) It seems to us that instead of Zrati should be read: Drakos. 


The destruction was foretold, as if he wanted to say: The 
ungodliness of the teaching causes me to proceed with 
punishments against the people, to finally also destroy 
them, because they despised me and preferred to listen 
to the deceivers. 


And, behold, | will leave the people every one in the 
hand of another. 


From Josephus all this is clear, and this interpretation 
of ours is confirmed by the histories which are in 
Josephus. But he writes that when the Sadducees and 
Pharisees ruled, everything was in the greatest 
confusion, nothing was safe and quiet; there was murder 
and constant turmoil among the Jewish people. For in 
addition to the fact that this land was exceedingly 
afflicted with internal troubles, the Roman Empire also 
broke in, by which the Jews were often miserably 
punished. And in all this there was a prelude to the last 
disturbance, which was more wretched and terrifying 
than any other could equal it. And to these disturbances 
he alludes here, since he says: "And in the hand of his 
king," that is, whom they serve, whether it be the king of 
Syria or the ruler of the Romans 2c. 


That they break up the country. 


Namely, through these internal ills and the attack of 
the enemies 2c. 


V. 7. And | tended the sheep for the slaughter. 


| believe that this is Christ's answer to the previous 
command he received to feed the sheep. And if it be so, 
it is connected with the preceding, "Thus said the LORD, 
Shepherd the sheep of the slaughter." "But | tended" 2c. 
That is, as | was commanded of the Father, so | 
preached, and this | did "for the sake of the miserable 
sheep," that is, for the sake of the brokenhearted and 
oppressed among the people, for the weak, lowly, and 
rejected | will preserve for myself, after the fat and 
hopeful in Israel are slain. To the proof that this is the 
context of the text, also serves what follows [v. 13]: 
"Throw it down that it may be

2119 





be given to the potter. And | cast them into the Hans of 
the Lord, that they might be given to the potter. 1) 


And | took unto me two staves. 


He describes how he administered the teaching office, 
which was given to him by the Father. But the Hebrew 
word, which our [Latin] interpreter has translated by 


vifga, actually means a staff, namely such a staff, which 
the shepherds use to tend the sheep. For here it 
indicates the wife of a shepherd who feeds his flock. | 
would rather that the Hebrew words had remained, both 
meaning a staff, and that they had not been translated. 
The first staff he calls Noam, the other Choblim [XXXX] 
There is no doubt that Noam means something lovely, in 
German: "Lust". But what it is, | do not understand yet. | 
am uncertain what it actually means; some translate it by 
rope, others by all-leader, others by skipper. Everyone 
may assume what he likes. |, if | may follow my thoughts, 
think that it designates those who feel pain, so that he 
wants to be understood as different kinds of sticks, the 
first as a sweet one, which does not hurt the sheep, does 
not scatter them, but only gathers them and brings them 
together to pasture; the other as a hard one, with which 
he can protect the sheep and keep the wolves away, as 
if he wanted to indicate a club. But because we cannot 
put anything certain here, we do not want to depart from 
the interpretation of the Septuagint and Jerome, who 
have translated by "rope," so that we understand by the 
first stick "a fine little stick," a lovely and soft twig, but by 
the outer one a stick that is to serve as a scourge, or the 
scourge itself. And this is what concerns the grammar; 
we will add the opinion later. 


v. 8. And | destroyed three shepherds in one 
month. 
Now he describes the one who administers the 
Magisterium as if to say: With an even 


1) In unbelievable thoughtlessness, this entire citation is incorporated 
into the following keyword in both the Erlangen and the Weimar 
editions. 





| began my teaching ministry with a happy start, since | 
eradicated three shepherds in one month, that is, in an 
extremely short time. Here all interpreters have struggled 
extraordinarily what he wanted to be indicated by the 
three shepherds. | remain absolutely in the simple 
context: The Jewish people was governed by three kinds 
of superiors, namely the elders, priests and prophets. 
The elders are the kings, princes and judges who have 
the regiment in their hands, who preside over the 
administration of the sword. The priests ruled by the 
word, they administered the teaching office. The 
prophets had [divine] inspirations. The prophets were 
followed by the scribes, who are called teachers of the 


law (vouodiddoKaoi). But the Pharisees and the 


Sadducaeans did not administer a proper (legitima) 
office of government, but were sects. | think that the 
prophet is alluding to these three classes, as if he wanted 
to say: By my preaching | have put an end to the Jewish 
kingdom, | have destroyed it spiritually, namely by the 
word, which happened from the baptism of John, when 
Christ received the teaching office according to the 
revelation that came from heaven 2c. 


Because | did not like theirs. 


[Et abbreviata est anima mea] is a Hebrew way 
of speaking. But it means: to suffer something with 
impatience, to be peevish, as we also say in German 
almost with the same manner of speaking: "He is short- 
tempered," that is, he is impatient, he easily takes 
something ill. Therefore, the opinion is: | hate this people, 
| cannot but reject and scatter them, but | want to 
preserve few. Again, their soul also had a disgust for me, 
satiety and hatred against me has caught them. "I do not 
want them, so they do not want me again." Therefore | 
said: 


V. 9. | will not watch over you; that which dies, die; 
that which languishes, languish. 
Here the prophet [in Hebrew] used words in the feminine, 
therefore, | believe, to indicate the misfortune that the 
people suffer, since these godless masters are in the 
regiment, namely, that they lack a head and a man and 
a right shepherd, who is 


2120 D. xxvm, ISS-161. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. II, 9-II. 


2121 





Christ. Therefore the opinion is: Because you despise 
me, | despise you again; | do not care whether you perish 
or are saved. He who dies, let him die; he who is 
destroyed, let him be destroyed; | will not protect, | will 
not restore, | will not save. | will leave you sunk in the 
ephah (above Cap. 5, 8.), so that you cannot come out. 
And this judgment of God is felt by the Jews enough and 
more than enough today, since they, entangled in their 
errors, cannot wriggle out of it, so that they would repent 
and become blessed; they cannot come to the 
knowledge of the truth. For he speaks here of spiritual 
death and destruction, by which they are cut off from the 
fellowship of the blessed, and go astray no differently 
than if there were no God to take care of these matters 
of men. Thus, out of His judgment, the dear God also 
caused the whole world to go astray before He restored 
to us His gospel, through which we, snatched from 
Satan, are transferred into the kingdom of the Son of 
God 2c. 


V. 10. And | took my staff Gently. 


It is disputed among the interpreters in many ways what 
these two rods mean. | have also thought in many ways, 
but | see no better understanding than that which the text 


itself brings with it. For it clearly says that abscindere 


[baculum], or, to translate it more correctly, "to break 
the rod," is the same fei as "to cancel the covenant," 
which is well to be observed. But these two staves mean 
two sermons, the Gospel and the Law. The first rod is 
the gospel, that sweet and exceeding lovely word by 
which the sheep are fed and led and gathered together, 
that they err not, but are fed with kindness and 
lovingkindness. The other rod is the law, which is 
preached to the hard and stiff-necked works saints, that 
they may be terrified, threatening them with death and 
hell. So Christ also used both staffs, but he mainly used 
the first one, namely the gospel, because he came to 
preach the gospel to the poor, the broken and afflicted 
spirits, and the poor who were in need. 


He healed those who were weighed down by the burden 
of the law. But against the stiff-necked, severe severity 
was needed. But he says that he broke the first staff, that 
is, he took away the sweet gospel and the light from the 
Jews, so that this breaking refers more to the people 
than to the staff, as if he wanted to say: | have cast out 
the largest part of the people, so that they go astray in 
the highest blindness, from which they shall never be 
brought back, but | have preserved a few remnants. It is 
just what Paul also says [Rom.9, 28.] "The Lord will do a 
tax on earth", that is, that it bears fruit with a few, many 
he controls, who become unbelievers, and are rejected 
from the fellowship of the godly 1) 2c., as he adds: 


V. 11. And he was lifted up that day. 


Namely with this people. "My covenant", that is, the 
promise of the gospel. And so, to this day, the gospel has 
been taken from them. 


And the wretched sheep who were waiting for me 
realized that it was the word of the Lord. 


"The miserable sheep", that is, the very small part of 
the broken staff that is still left in my hand. These very 
few remains that have been preserved recognize the 
sweetness of the Gospel and what an exceedingly great 
treasure it is. Therefore they accept it and believe it. To 
all others it seems to be a word of the devil, which is 
evident everywhere from the history of the Gospel, 
where it is described how the godless Jews were most 
bitterly hostile to Christ, who did not want to recognize 
this light and salvation of the whole world. This is what 
this whole passage contains, that when the gospel is 
preached, everything that is high, glorious and wise in 
the world is angry. There are hardly a few who accept it, 
the wretched and despised by the world, but among the 
rest, the despisers, it is broken; not as if the holy gospel 
were broken, which is always a power of God, but 
according to the we-

latter reading. 


2122 D- xxvm. 161-164. interpretations on the prophets. 


2123 





The condemnation it produces in the hearts of the 
despisers, just as Paul makes the Antichrist sit above 
God 2c. 


V. 12 If it pleases you, bring how much | am worth. 


[Si bonum est in oculis vestris,] that is, "Do you 


like it." For this Hebrew way of speaking is frequent in 
Scripture, as, in the first book of Moses [Cap. 1, 31/: 
"And GOD looked at all that He had made, and behold, 
it was very good," that is, it pleased Him. Here the 
prophet inserts a remarkable passage in which he deals 
with the reason why the staff of which he had just spoken 
was broken, and he describes the godless Jews who 
despised Christ and treated Him in the most unworthy 
manner. For they held him in such contempt that they 
preferred even the murderer Barrabas to him, and then 
bought him for thirty pieces of silver, which is clear from 
the history of the Gospel. This is the contempt that the 
prophet draws on them, as if to say, "You would have 
rightly esteemed Christ, the true King and your Savior, 
but you despised him, bought him, considered him 
nothing, and therefore he rightly rejected you. 

"Do you like it", that is, do you want to buy me or do 
you not? Since all this is perfectly consistent with the 
Gospel story of Christ being sold, let us not seek 
another, more remote interpretation. But he leaves it up 
to them to buy or not to buy. He says that it is up to them, 
not that God commands them to buy, but that he 
punishes the carelessness of their hearts, because they 
held Christ so low that they even discussed whether they 
should pay the price of thirty pieces of silver for him to 
Judas or not. And so he imitated their deliberation in 
which they discussed the selling price. 


V. 13. Throw it, that it may be given to the potter. 
The evangelist Matthew [Cap., 27, 10/ translates 


[instead of ad statuarium in the Vulgate]: "to the potter", 
and quite correctly. Because the Hebrew word means a 
potter, which is 





is quite clear from many passages of Scripture. Ps. 2:9 
[Vulg/: "Like a potter's vessel you shall break them." 
Likewise in the 103rd Psalm, 1) [v. 14/: "He knoweth 


what manner of vessel (figmentum) we are." Likewise 
in Sirach 2) [Cap. 33, 13/: "Like clay in the potter's hand" 
2c. Because the Jews cannot resolve this passage, 
which is so clearly against them, they translate it 
differently. Some  also_ translate: God's box 


[thesaurarium = treasure house]. 


Ei, an excellent summa! 


Decorum pretium or a glorious prize. It is irony, as 
if he wanted to say: This is certainly my excellent people, 
which | have esteemed so great, which | have brought 
back from Egypt with such great miracles and such great 
power, which | have chosen before all the peoples of the 
earth; see, how they despise me, what thanks they give 
me for my exceedingly rich goods, for my miracles, 
services and sermons, "is it not a beautiful money", for 
which they buy me? Their leader and chief is Judas, who 
sells me. But what shall | do? they despise me, they sell 
and buy me, they appoint me innocent to death; | 
certainly deserve that, | will truly suffer to be sold and 
bought, | will suffer to be led to death as a sheep does, | 
will not resist. 


And | took the thirty pieces of silver. 


This is exactly in accordance with the passage in 
Matthew [Cap. 27, 3. ff/, which writes that Judas, when 
the betrayal had soured him, was smitten by his 
conscience over the sin he had committed, and hurried 
back to the scribes and Pharisees, and threw the 
purchase price at their feet in the temple, and relieved 
his suffering with a rope; after that the money came to 
the potter, namely for the purchased field 2c. Here the 
sacred writers struggle, and Jerome raises the question 
why the evangelist Matthew quoted this testimony as if it 
were from Jeremiah, while nowhere in Jeremiah does it 
say that the money came to the potters.

2125 





but in this prophet Zechariah. | have to answer this 
recently: The evangelists are not used to quote the 
testimonies of the prophets literally, but only to give their 
opinion, which also Matthew does in the passage that is 
written in the ninth chapter, v. 9, where the prophet said: 
"Daughter of Zion, rejoice greatly, and daughter of 
Jerusalem, exult" 2c. Matthew adduces it thus [Cap. 21, 
5.]: as it is written, "Say ye to the daughter of Zion, 
Behold, thy King cometh unto thee," 2c. where the words 
are quite different, yet nothing is changed in the mind. 
Then Matthew [Cap. 27, 9.] also added this: "Of the 
children of Israel," which is not in the prophet, namely, 
that he might explain the selling and the buying, 
remembering that it was done of the children of Israel. 
Then, to the fact that he quotes it as if it were from 
Jeremiah, | have nothing else to answer than this well- 
known word, that the prophet may have had two names, 
or that he may have quoted in general according to the 
manner that the other evangelists also have, 
unconcerned about the name of the prophet. Augustine 
treats this subject carefully, see after. | would not easily 
believe that the books of the prophets were confused by 
changing the titles. Then, in Matthew's case, there were 
undoubtedly holy and learned people, full of the Holy 
Spirit, who reminded him that this passage of Scripture 
he had cited was in Zechariah, not in Jeremiah. 
Prompted by their recollection, he could easily have 
corrected this minor error if it had pleased him, or if he 
had thought there was much in it. But there is no reason 
why we should anxiously agonize over these and similar 
concerns, since in these things does not lie the main and 
epitome of our faith. Those are exceedingly nonsensical 
who labor in such unnecessary matters, which, 
nevertheless, the prophets of our time are bent upon 
solely by reading the Scriptures for the purpose of 
finding out such passages as may give rise to disputes 
and quarrels. In the meantime, they leave the main 
points of religion pending, while they should do this one 
thing above all, that they should teach Christianity. 





stum who reigns. This is what all the apostles do 
unanimously, who everywhere teach the mystery of the 
passion and resurrection of Christ, as if they had 
forgotten all the other miracles and deeds of Christ 2c. 


Vv. 14. And | broke my other staff Woe. 


This staff is the administration of the law, as | have 
also interpreted above. But he says that this last staff is 
broken, that is, in addition, that the gospel is taken away 
from them, this lovely and exceedingly sweet preaching, 
the law is also taken away for them, namely in such a 
way that they no longer have the law, from which they 
could establish the priesthood, kingdom, ceremonies 
and sacrifices, but all this ceases after the law is taken 
away from them, that is, they can no longer keep the law, 
they lack the city, the temple, the priesthood, therefore 
they cannot perform sacrifices; Nowadays they carry 
around only the Bible and their more than ridiculous 
dreams. This must not be taken from the spiritual 
abdication of the law, as it is abdicated for all the godly, 
that it no longer has the right to accuse and condemn, 
but it indicates: neither in the letter nor in the spirit is it 
abdicated for them, that is, they have no use of the law. 


That | may raise up the brotherhood between Judah 
and Israel. 
That is, between the right Jews and those who are so 


according to the letter (litera- les). Those of the children 
of Abraham who have believed are called "Judah"; those 
who have not believed, "Israel". For in this prophet these 
words must be taken spiritually, as also the apostle Paul 
interprets [Rom. 2, 28. f.], so that by the name "Judah" 
are signified the faithful 2c. For nowadays Jerusalem is 
all over the earth, wherever there are believers, which is 
clear from the 87th Psalm, v. 4: "Behold, the Philistines 
and the Tyres together with the Moors are born there." 
This struggle between the true Jews and those who are 


(literal) Jews in name never ceases.

are. Even today, the law is still the subject of heated 
debate, as we see in the epistle to the Romans. But 
because the Jews stubbornly’ defend _ their 
righteousness, they do not attain righteousness. 


V. 15: Take unto thee the tools of a foolish 
shepherd. 


This whole passage is drawn by the holy writers with 
great agreement to the Antichrist, and especially Lyra, 
whose books, as | believe, deal well to the third part with 
the Antichrist. | do not understand them differently than 
that here a sign is given to the preceding prophecy, in 
order to confirm it. For so it happens in all prophets that 
signs are added to the sermons, which we have 
abundantly reminded above. Thus Jeremiah carried a 
wooden yoke [Cap. 27, 2.], thus Isaiah went naked [Cap. 
20, 2.] 2c. Thus a sign is here added to the preceding 
sermon of the rejection and ruin of the people. But the 
prophet is commanded to take with him the tools of a 
shepherd, that is, tools such as a shepherd uses: a hat, 
a sackcloth, a mantle, a staff, and also the flute. But "a 
foolish shepherd," that is, one who in all things 


resembles a shepherd in outward appearance (habitu), 
but in fact does nothing less than what befits a shepherd. 


V. 16 For behold, | will raise up shepherds in the 
land. 


The prophet interprets the sign. But it is the singular 


[pastorem] for the plural, as if to say, They bought and 
sold me, who was the right shepherd and savior; they 
sold me for thirty pieces of silver. "| came in my Father's 
name and they did not accept me. Another shall come in 
his name, and they shall receive him" [John 5:43], and 
that to their great hurt, for he shall be a ruin to their souls 
and to their goods. For that which is scattered shall not 
be gathered together, neither shall that which is broken 
be healed 2c. What this is, is abundantly treated by me 
ina 





Sermon 1) on a similar passage of Ezekiel. In sum, 
however, it is this: A right shepherd must be watchful, 
diligent in word, he must take account of consciences, 
that he may comfort the sorrowful, strengthen the 
afflicted so that they do not despair, bring back those 
who have turned away, in short, that he may win many 
to Christ. But a foolish shepherd, he says, does none of 
these things, because they no longer have the word. It is 
taken from them, both staves are broken. But if the word 
is not there, then all preaching is in vain; indeed, it is 
exceedingly harmful and destructive to souls, like the 
most effective poison, as he soon adds: 


They will tear their claws. 


This is a beautiful passage and worthy of attention; 
that is, they will make them unfit. Thus the false teachers 
are constantly told in the Scriptures that they corrupt 
both bodies and souls. But to the claws is ascribed the 
power of preaching, as appears from Micah [Cap.4, 13.]: 
"| will give thee claws of iron." Since the prophet says 
here that those foolish shepherds will tear the claws of 
all, he indicates the misfortune that results from ungodly 
teaching: that the sheep are hurt and afflicted and 
prevented from going to pasture, that the consciences 
cannot come to the knowledge of the truth. But to this 
day, the ungodly teachers of the Jews resist the 
wretched in such a way that they cannot come out of 
error, and are even more entangled and immersed in 
error from day to day. 


V. 17. 0 idolaters! 


That is, you represent a shepherd in outward 
appearance, but without any service, not unlike how a 
painted idol represents someone's person. 


Who let the herd. 


This is read [instead of derelinquens in the Vulgate] 
in Hebrew plainly so in the plural. 


1) The sermon on the Sunday Misericordias Domini is meant. 
Walch, St. Louis edition, vol. XI, 782, 8 10 ff. Luther also refers to this.

That is, though you are lumps and idols, adorned with 
the garb of shepherds, yet in truth you are far from being 
shepherds. For you do not feed the sheep, you only 
fatten yourselves with the milk and the yield of the sheep. 


The sword comes down on her arm and on her right 
eye. 
That is, there is no power in them, which is signified by 
the right arm, no knowledge and no light of truth, which 
he understands by the right eye. For "the sword comes 
upon them," that is, the wrath of God and the judgment 
by which they are punished and weakened and made 
strong, so that they are unable to do anything. That is, 
they are without the light of truth, overwhelmed with 
darkness and error in every way, in which they lie buried 
and enclosed, as it were, so that they cannot even 
breathe after the truth. Therefore they can do nothing 
right, nothing good. They have one arm, but a left one, 
that is, they labor and are even concerned in the 
righteousness of the works of the flesh, but they are not 
the right works, they are without light and truth, they are 
foreboding faith, therefore they are all only sins. Then 





they also have a left eye, that is, they are quite 
perceptive in the prudence of the flesh and of this world, 
so that in this respect they also surpass the children of 
light, as Christ says [Luc. 16, 8.], but left is everything, 
everything they hold is carnal. This cleverness is death 
and enmity against God, as the apostle says in the letter 
to the Romans [Cap. 8, 6. 7.]. Such a sword is over all 
who are cut off from grace, that they can do nothing, 
know nothing, or understand nothing. Others understand 
this passage simply of the downfall of false teachers; but 
the former view is more appropriate and fills me, namely, 
that the ungodly is the punishment for himself, as St. 
Augustine says. For as soon as the ungodly has 
departed from godliness, he has his punishment; there 
is nothing lacking in it but that it is not yet revealed. 
Therefore, this whole passage can be very appropriately 
drawn to the Roman pope and the bishops of our lines, 
who, except for the outward appearance and insignia of 
bishops, do nothing that befits a bishop. They are clogs 
and idols, born only to the ruin of souls, while they also 
lack the right eye and the right arm, that they teach 
nothing wholesome, but only the ruin of souls 2c. 


The twelfth chapter. 


The exegetes make a strange effort in explaining this 
chapter, one twisting it here, the other there. Lyra 
interprets it from the persecution of the first church, and 
goes over to the Antichrist, that he will sit in the temple 
at Jerusalem, and | do not know what other trivial things 
he tells. | do not blame those, but rather want to follow 
them, who interpret it from the next time after Christ, 
which fruit was finally brought by the word of the 
apostles, who were first sent to the Jewish land, and then 
to all peoples in the whole world. 


V. 1. This is the burden of the word of the LORD 
upon Israel. 


We are forced to take "Israel" here as a transferred name 
for the church of Christ, since the gospel first began in 
this people, and the apostle Paul also expressly 
distinguishes the right Israel from the carnal: they are not 
all Israelites who are of Israel [Rom. 9, 6.], but they are 
of the believing seed [Gal. 3, 7.]. Israel according to the 
flesh has never been restored, nor shall it be restored. 
Therefore, since he speaks of a certain burden that is to 
come upon Israel, we must understand it of the believing 
Israel, since when this was prophesied by Zechariah, the 
kingdom of Israel was already scattered and desolate. 


2130 D. xxvm, i7o-i72. Interpretations on the prophets. 


was. But he says it will be such a burden that Israel will 
suffer persecutions from the neighboring nations and all 
the wicked, who will exercise their tyranny against the 
believers who accept and believe the gospel. Then there 
will not only be outward violence, but also danger from 
false brethren who challenge the truth with cunning and 
deceit. This battle against the church of Christ goes on 
and on, so that some attack the believers by force, 
others by deceit and intend to 1) destroy them. All this 
will he hereafter abundantly expound. 


Says the LORD, who stretched out the heavens, and 
founded the earth, and made the breath of man in him. 


With necessity the prophet sends this title before, 
because in it lies the summa of comfort against this 
extremely heavy burden of the enemies of the gospel, 
as if he wanted to say: The evil, the cross and the 
tyranny of the adversaries, will indeed come, likewise 
the deceit of the false teachers, but all this shall not 
concern you. The Lord is on your side, it is he who 
founds heaven and earth, it is he who forms the breath 
of man, so that he can think of nothing without his will. 


But the word Spiritus indicates the heart, the movement 
or disposition of the mind. This, says the Lord, is like 
clay; as the clay is in the hand of the potter, so are the 
counsels, the reasons of the counsels, in short, all the 
thoughts of man in the will of the Lord; he is the molder, 
who changes our counsels, directs and guides them 
according to his will, wherever he wills, like a potter. For 
here is the same word which we translated by "potter" in 
the previous chapter [v. 13]. Thus the prophet does not 
speak of the creating of minds, but how the dear GOD 
directs and drives the already created hearts and 
counsels as he wills and where he wills, so that without 
the will of the LORD we cannot even think anything, let 
alone carry out what we have thought 2c. And this, | 
have said, is an exceedingly rich consolation for the 
godly, when in the cross. 


1) Instead of eoKLntur we have assumed eoZitent. 


2131 


When they are imprisoned, when they suffer 
persecution, when they are sentenced to death, that they 
do not fear the violence and tyranny of the enemies of 
the gospel, however much they do evil against them and 
threaten them with destruction; then, however much the 
false teachers attack them and oppose the teaching of 
the faith: When they suffer all these things, | say, let them 
not despair; let them know that the tyrants will not 
counsel anything but what the Lord wills, who is the 
maker of their breath. And so we are quite sure that it is 
not in the power of our enemies to harm a single hair of 
our head if the Lord does not allow it, no matter how 
much they rage against us and how many ways they use 
to bring us to death. 2c. 


V, 2. Behold, | will make Jerusalem a cup of stupor 
to all the nations that are round about. 


Most of the translations in our [Latin] Bibles are 
extraordinarily inconsistent. Jerome followed the 


Septuagint here and translated it by superliminare, but 
| do not like this. Now first of all let us get rid of that which 
concerns grammar, for this passage is very obscure. | 
translate and connect this passage like this: | will make 
Jerusalem a cup of stupor to all the nations round about, 
which are also against Judah in the siege against 
Jerusalem; that is, in that they besiege Jerusalem, they 
will also besiege Judah. But that | translate "a cup" or a 
bowl, and not "lintel," is proved by Exodus 12:22, 
although Jerome also translated the same word here by 


limen, but badly. For it must be read like this: "And put 
a tuft of hyssop in the blood that is in the basin, and 
sprinkle it on the threshold" 2c. Next, what we have 


translated by Commotio [staggering] is a very significant 
word, which actually means: to stagger, to stagger, as 
the drunkards are wont to do when neither the foot nor 
the mind do their duty properly. Habakkuk 2:5: "But wine 
deceiveth the proud man, that he cannot abide. "2c. [V. 
16:] "Now therefore drink thou also, that thou mayest 
stagger," that is, stagger. 


2132 L. XXVIII, 172-174. interpretation of Sakharine (2.), cap. 12, 2. 3. 


2133 





like a drunkard. So it is also said in Is. 51, 1) 17: "The 
yeasts of the cup of staggering thou hast drunk out, 


where the same word is, but [instead of soporis, of deep 


sleep] it is more correct to read: Commotionis [of 
staggering]. Thus it is said in the Psalm [Ps. 60, 5.]:2 
"Thou hast given us a drink of wine, that we staggered. 
"2c. Therefore, the opinion is as if he wanted to say: all 
nations, especially the godless Jews, who are around 
the believers, will stagger like the drunkards. They will 
indeed devour Jerusalem, but to their great misfortune, 
because by devouring it will happen that they stagger, "it 
will not get them the food". They will attack Jerusalem 
and Judah, which they think will swallow them whole, but 
by swallowing them up and overthrowing them, they will 
rather be swallowed up and overthrown themselves. So 
this again is an exceedingly rich consolation for the godly 
hearts that are oppressed under the cross, that they 
know that they will be victorious among the evils. For 
even though Christians are killed, they still rule over 
those who kill them, and through the cross they rule 
against persecution, through death they gain life 2c. 

Now let us deal with the movement of the heart. This 
victory can happen in two ways, either in kindness or in 
severity, that is, some of the enemies are devoured in 
wrath, some in mercy; namely, by the Church obtaining 
through prayer that many of the enemies and 
persecutors of the faith are converted to the faith, but 
others are devoured and perish by the terrible judgment 
of God. This is what happened to the Romans, many of 
whom, awakened by the blood of the martyrs, were 
converted to the faith and thus preserved, although they 
had previously persecuted the Christians most bitterly. 
But those who continued in their godlessness and did not 
cease to devour the Christians finally suffered great 
punishments for devouring them, and that for the sake of 
Jerusalem, that is, for the sake of the Christians, whose 
blood is esteemed in the sight of the Lord, 


1) In our template: Lsa. 29. 
2) In Weimar's margin: Ps. 59, 5. 





so that it would have been better if they had not even 
touched the Christians. The same happened to the 
Jews, and it will also happen to our popes and princes, 
who do not cease to gnash and rage against the gospel 
of the great God, setting fire to their own house. And they 
have no hope that the Lord will not avenge their 
wickedness, who sees the cry of his servants and the cry 
of innocent blood, as he says in the first book of Moses 
[Cap. 2, 10]: "The blood of Abel cries out to me" 2c. Next, 
that he says: 


For it will also apply to Judah when Jerusalem is 
besieged. 


This shows the extremely bitter hatred and tyranny of 
the enemies of the gospel, that they are not satisfied with 
having subjugated the Christians, as it is customary 
according to the law of war, but want to see them 
completely and utterly destroyed from the bottom up, so 
that not even the name remains. So from the bottom up 
they want the church of Christ to be destroyed, but Christ 
said [Matth. 16, 18.]: "The gates of hell shall not prevail 
against it." 


Vv. 3. Yet at that time | will make Jerusalem a burden 
stone to all the nations. 


Another simile. "Burden" actually means "a load that 
one loads on himself," 3) as it is written in the first book 
of Moses, where Joseph commands that the sacks be 
filled and loaded on the donkeys 2c. [Gen. 42, 25. f.] For 
with this the German idiom is true: "Thou shalt load it 
upon thee." Hence the opinion is, The enemies of the 
godly load themselves with a great burden: they wish to 
lift this stone on high and hurl it away, that it may be 
utterly shattered; they wish to have it thrust away from 
the earth; but while they think nothing of the kind, it falls 
upon their heads, and turns them, as it were, to dust. And 
so they themselves are shattered, and the Lord receives 
his own, whom he does not esteem less than his own 
apple. This again can happen in two ways: the one to 
salvation, the other to condemnation, as | mentioned 
above. 


3) In the original: eyn load das eyner auff Bich leth. 


2134 L. xxv, 174-17". Interpretations about the prophets. 


2135 





that some will be converted and brought to judgment, 
while others will be condemned more severely. 


For all the nations of the earth will gather against 
them. 


As if he wanted to say: There are great and very 
strong enemies, who all set themselves against 
Jerusalem, stretch out all their sinews to tear it apart, so 
that they destroy it completely, but they may rage as 
they please, "they will not succeed in their intentions, for 
| will turn their evil deeds on their own heads. 2c. 


In that day, saith the LORD, | will make all horses 
afraid, and their riders afraid. 

This is a declaration about the party that is angry, that 
is, he describes the punishment of the adversaries who 
cannot be moved or converted, that they should stop 
setting themselves against God in vain. Their horses are 
made timid, they themselves are smitten with anguish. 
And this is an interpretation of the staggering of which 
he said shortly before [v. 2.), namely, in that* the HErr 
makes the hearts of the enemies despondent, so that 
they cannot help distrusting their cause, as he says in 
Habakkuk [Cap. 2, 16.) to the king of Babylon: "So now 
you also drink that you stagger," that is, just as you have 
raged, disturbed many kingdoms, destroyed many 
nations, so now the same will happen to you, you will 
again become a prey to the enemies 2c. 


But over Jerusalem | will have my eyes open. 


Namely, everything happens in such a way, - contrary to 
what the wicked hope: while they think that they alone 
rule, and safely exercise their tyranny against the godly, 
they perish, as the Psalm says [Ps. 37, 35. f.]: "I have 
seen a wicked man, who was defiant, and spread 
himself out like a laurel tree. As one passed by, behold, 
he was gone." But the godly are exalted, and GOD takes 
care of them. While the world thought that it was over for 
them, the Lord looks at them with mercy and a favorable 
attitude, does not leave a hair on their heads. 


He is very close to them in the midst of death, in the midst 
of misfortune. Namely, he gives the spirit of the wicked a 


form (est plastes spiritus) in such a way that they cannot 
harm the godly, however much they may attack them, 
however much they may plot against them and threaten 
them with evil 2c. 


Vv. 5. and the princes of Judah will say in their 
hearts. 


That is, even though Judah will be so oppressed, 
even though it will feel the violence of the tyrants, there 
will still be comfort left in the hearts of the rulers, who will 
uphold the weary and fainthearted, so that they will not 
fall into miseries, that is, the ministers of the Word will 
anxiously care for the brethren, they will strengthen and 
fortify them by the Word, so that they will stand firm. They 
will be made confident, not in their strength, not by horses 
and weapons, as their adversaries, but in the Lord of 
hosts, their God. Thus the cross, the blood, the tyrants, 
the violence, the prison, the calamity, the death, 1) the 
persecution, - all these are seen before the hands and 
are before the eyes: and yet we triumph through a 
wonderful victory, which is not seen, which is not before 
the eyes (yes, the opposite is before the eyes), in all 
these things, and come forth as conquerors, namely 
through him who turns his face toward us, in whom is the 
embodiment of victory. 


V. 6. | will make the princes of Judah a fiery furnace 
in the wood. 


What our (Latin) interpreter translated by CaMINUS is 
according to the Hebrew a hand barrel. But he (the 
prophet) takes it for a fiery mass, as red-hot iron is. For 
he alludes to the brazen hand-barrel for washing [Ex. 
30:18.], which shines like filers. Now he describes the 
victory of the godly with other parables, as if he wanted 
to say: So much is lacking that the ones of mine should 
perish, that they should be oppressed or devoured, that 
they themselves should be the ones 


1) The seven necessary commas preceding in this sentence are 
all missing in the Weimar one. 


2136 L. xxvm, i-6-i78. Interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 12, 6. 7. 


2137 





They will devour those who threatened them with death 
and all kinds of evil. For so shall the princes of Judah be 
against the enemies, as a fiery mass brought in wood, 
and as a torch in straw, where nothing can enter but 
conflagration and burning. Namely, they will prevail 
against all the tyranny of the world, as fire prevails over 
wood, a burning torch over straw. Again, we are 
presented with an exceedingly rich consolation, in which 
we see that the dear God compares all enemies 
altogether and all the power of the world to wood and 
straw, but we, who are weak before the world, who are 
thrown into prison, who are also killed, we, | say, he 
says, are torches by which this straw and dry wood is 
burned. This is what we are commanded to do, to fill our 
hearts with such rich consolations, so that we may use 
them when the need arises. For faith alone can grasp 
this; to the flesh it seems impossible, because in 
everything the opposite is before our eyes. So much is 
lacking that it could believe 2c. 


And Jerusalem shall also remain in her place at 
Jerusalem. 


This also serves as a consolation, as if he wanted to 
say: Although the tyrants want the church to be 
completely destroyed, it will still exist, although not only 
the world, but also the gates of hell say no to it; rather, 
the church will remain unharmed, but they will perish. 
For the passage must not be understood of the bodily 
Jerusalem, as the words seem to read, for in the Hebrew 


this is expressly added: sub €a, that is, wherever it is, 
there it will be preserved, will not perish. 


V. 7. and the LORD will save the tabernacles of 
Judah 2c. 


This is what | said above, that the church is constantly 
attacked, partly by force, partly by the deceitfulness of 
false prophets. Here we have nothing better to hope for, 
for we also experience both of these things today, which 
can serve as proof that we have received the Word of 
God rightly and truly from God. For it is not lacking 





of such people who do violence against us, who would 
prefer that we all perish in a moment, then there is also 
no lack of false brothers and false prophets, yes, we 
have an abundance of them. But against all this the Lord 
saves the tabernacles of Judah, that is, he protects and 
preserves the church by the same Spirit by which he has 
always preserved it. "The house of David" was the royal 
house, therefore by the appellation "the house of David" 
the royal lineage is expressed. "The citizens" ninth the 
inhabitants of the fleshly Jerusalem. From all these he 
takes away the glory, so that neither the royal tribe nor 
other citizens may boast of any thing according to the 
flesh. For this alone do the false prophets chiefly, that 
they seek their glory. For honor, as St. Augustine says, 
is the mother of all heresy. And yet they do not want to 
be regarded as anything less by always having only this 
one thing in mind, that they do everything for the glory of 
God. It is therefore the summa of this passage: | will 
humble them through the cross and through tyrants, so 
that they, taught by experience, may know that it is with 
me alone that they are saved, and thus boast of me 
alone, not of their wisdom, not of their strength, not of 
their power, but "he who boasts," says Paul, "let him 
boast of the Lord" [1 Cor. 1:31]. Otherwise, the house of 
David will soon confront Judah, one will despise the 
other in comparison to himself, and the false teachers 
will want to be considered the best. For this evil there is 
no other, more effective remedy than that one comes to 
the knowledge of God; and this happens through the 
teaching of the cross, when they are pressed by 
adversity, that they are forced to despair of their strength 
and efforts, but assign the honor to God alone. 
Otherwise they cannot but boast of the flesh of their 
hearers, as the apostle Paul says, who everywhere 
deals with depriving the false teachers of their honor, 
and does not give them a nail's breadth. Many passages 
in Paul's letters are well known [2 Cor. 11, 22]: "They are 
Abraham's seed, so am |; they are Israelites, so am |; 
they are servants of Christ, so am |" 2c.

V. 8: At that time the Lord will protect the people of 
Jerusalem. 


The prophet goes on to describe the figurative or 
rather spiritual Jerusalem. "At that time", namely of the 
New Testament, when the kingdom of grace will be, the 
Lord will protect. The prophet speaks in the manner of a 
had, as if he wanted to say: Until now he has also 
protected Jerusalem, but hardly in a small measure. But 
when the gospel reigns, when grace is revealed through 
Christ, it will be a perpetual and constant protection, but 
in the way it exists in the spirit. For to the flesh it does 
not seem to be a protection, but a persecution, since the 
enemies attack and persecute the believers and treat 
them in the most shameful way, as is abundantly 
described above. Therefore, this protection is spiritual, 
which is grasped in faith, which believes the victory in 
death, righteousness in sin, deliverance in captivity, in 
short, in the cross the Lord 2c. 


And it shall come to pass, that he that shall be weak 
among them in that day shall be as David. 


| think that the simplest view of this passage is that in the 
kingdom of Christ the merit of the believers is no longer 
considered, but only the mercy, grace and goodness of 
God; therefore, the kingdom of Christ is also called a 
kingdom of grace. In short, this is his opinion: that 
everything serves the believers for the best, because 
they are children of grace; everything is credited to them, 
"they cannot spoil it". Even if they have been foolish and 
infirm at times, the divine goodness closes their eyes; 
nothing is imputed to them. For all the sins of believers, 
though mortal sins, are nevertheless venial sins. But 
those who are out of grace are still not approved, 
however much they labor with many, very great, and 
very good works. They are no less displeasing to God 
than Saul was; because he fell from grace, nothing in 
him pleased God. On the other hand, he gave David 
credit for the greatest shameful deeds: the adultery, the 
murder, that he had given the Gentiles cause to 
blaspheme the Lord 2c., as 





is written in the sacred histories. All these sins, | say, 
although they were mortal sins, nevertheless became 
venial sins, "because he was one of the dear children, 
who 1 [it] cannot spoil". And so, says the prophet here, 
will be done with all the godly. David is the figure and 
image of all believers, so that, just as even the greatest 
sins are forgiven David, so all things are forgiven Christ's 
believers, if only they do not fall from the faith. Therefore, 
the kingdom of Christ is well described here, namely that 
it is nothing other than a kingdom of forgiveness, of 
granting and forgiving of sins. But it costs work, it costs 
effort, that we remain in this kingdom, that we do not fall 
out of it. For it is to be feared that a vain delusion will 
deceive us, which deceives many, thinking that they are 
in the kingdom of Christ, while they are not. These top 
sentences are quite certain: Every child of the church is 
a child of forgiveness and grace; likewise: No child can 


sin unto death (mortaliter). But if you make the 
subordinate clause: | am a child of grace, you are, he is, 
then you will indeed be able to deceive yourself very 
easily. Hence it is that unclean swine break into the 
sanctuary and defile everything, and become a cause for 
others to blaspheme against the grace of Christ. But 
David comes to grace, not through any merit that he has, 
if you want to look at the merit 2). He deserved judgment 
and wrath, but because he was guilty, he immediately 
obtained grace, where he said [2 Sam. 12, 13.], "| have 
sinned." For immediately the prophet [Nathan] 3) adds, 
"So also hath the LORD taken away thy sin." For if this 
confession is righteous in the heart, God cannot fail to 
make them children of grace.

2140 XXVIII, 180-183. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 12, 8-10. 


2141 





And the house of David will be like God's house. 


In the house of God everything is joyful, lovely and 
peaceful; joy, delight, security, peace, mercy reign in it. 
So, he says, is the Church of Christ, in which, as in the 
house of God, there is no lack of good, and even if some 
evil remains, as long as we live in the sinful flesh, it is not 
imputed to us. 


Like the Lord's angels before them. 


This is added to describe the figure or the way of the 
church, how this kingdom of Christ is arranged in us while 
we are still alive, so that no one may dream himself a 
visible and bodily kingdom. He [a Christian] 1) is, he 
says, like an angel, that is, like a messenger, as if to say, 
He still has an angelic house, that is, everything is still 
hidden in word, there is still a kingdom of faith, everything 
is still in a dark word, as Paul [1 Cor. 13:12.] says, until 
the time comes when everything will be revealed face to 
face. Therefore, by this word he points us to the still 
contending Church, for everything is still covered, it is 
only believed. But before God it is visible and always 
before our eyes; for this revelation we also wait. 


V. 9. And in that day | will remember to destroy all 
the nations. 


This is a comfort by which he declares that he speaks of 
a kingdom of faith and a spiritual kingdom. For he also 
said the same thing at the beginning of this chapter about 
the ungodly opponents of the word and those who follow 
the word, how they strain all their sinews to completely 
destroy and destroy the church of Christ. Against all 
these evils he comforts the believers, as he did above, 
as if he wanted to say: The godless persecutors oppress 
my church, they want to destroy it in every way, but | will 
avenge them; | will protect them, and protect them in 
such a way that my Christians shall be unharmed; but the 
adversaries shall perish. | will look out, | will look at 


1) This is how Luther interprets it in the previous relation. 





You, my faithful, enjoy my goods safely and let me have 
my revenge. | will preserve you, though the gates of hell 
and all the power of the world oppose you; this also he 
has gloriously fulfilled. For the kingdom of the Romans, 
as well as the kingdom of the Jews, he has destroyed, 
and all those who have ever opposed the church of 
Christ have perished. 2c. 


V. 10. | will pour out the spirit of grace and prayer. 


This is another description of the kingdom of the 
church, and it is the opinion: | will not allow my Christians 
to protect themselves with weapons and teams and 
warfare, because they will turn their swords into 
plowshares and their spears into sickles “Jes. 2, 4.]. It 
will be a kingdom of peace, but | will give them other 
weapons with which to fight against the enemy, the spirit 
of graces and prayer (this is what he calls the Holy Spirit). 
"The Spirit of graces" he calls the Holy Spirit because He 
makes us a gracious GOD, and because we love one 
another in the closest union of hearts. In fact, this word 
is very broad when explained in more detail, because it 
is the feeling and awareness of the fullest favor among 
believers. Here, friendliness, cheerfulness, forbearance, 
philanthropic behavior and everything else that can be 
found in an extremely loving disposition prevail. Set 
against this the nurturing of anger, impatience, sullen 
disposition, and such other bitter movements of the 
heart, which are not in the church of Christ, where there 
is only favor, for they are favorable to God and to one's 
neighbor, even to one's enemies. This is what the 
apostle Paul says [Rom. 5, 5.]: The Holy Spirit is poured 
into our hearts 2c. 

Of prayer. 

This is what the apostle Paul declared [Phil. 4, 5. 6.]: 
"The Lord is near. Do not be anxious, but in all things let 
your petition be made known in prayer and supplication 
with thanksgiving before God." As if he wanted to say: 
Do not be anxious, you have the Lord to pray for you. 


2142 L. XXVIII, 183-185. interpretations on the prophets. 


2143 





Protector, the Lord is on your side, he will take up 
and uphold your cause; put away all fear, anger and 
bitterness. But if you want to fight something, fight 
through prayers. For there is nothing else by which 
we can fight Satan and make him waver than by 
prayers, or, to translate it more correctly here, by 
urgent  supplications (obsecrationibus). For 
obsecratio is something stronger than oratio, as if he 
wanted to say: to pray in a holy cause, than if we add 
to our prayers: Through Jesus Christ our Lord 2c. 


Because they will look at me,.which one they have 
punctured. 


This passage is quoted by the evangelist John in 
the 19th chapter, v. 37. But there is a wonderful 
sequence here. What follows until the end of the 
chapter is about lamentation, namely such a 
lamentation, which should be about Christ. This is 
also said in the Gospel [Matth. 24, 30]: All 
generations on earth will howl over him. But we do 
not want to refer it to the day of judgment, because 
we are dealing here with the description of the 
church. Therefore | understand it thus: the life of a 
Christian man is twofold, a life of the spirit and of the 
death of the flesh, since after we have been made 
righteous and transferred into the kingdom of God's 
grace, it still remains that we also mourn over our 
flesh, that we not only mourn and lament Christ who 
has suffered, but also follow him, that we at the same 
time die with him and crucify our flesh. And it is of 
this death of the flesh that he speaks here, not of the 
howling of the last judgment, when all eyes will see 
Christ as the judge who convicts all the ungodly of 
the guilt of having stabbed him. For the hands of the 
Jews who pierced Christ are the hands of all the 
wicked. But the Christians, as long as they live here, 
grieve at the death of their flesh, and that for the sake 
of Christ, since our old man was crucified together 
with Christ, died with him and was buried, as the 
apostle says in the letter to the Romans [Cap. 6, 6. 
4.]. Therefore, to grieve for Christ's sake, is to be 
saddened by Christ's crucifixion, the 





He says that we will follow death and burial, that our 
flesh and carnal mind will be killed, both by ourselves 
and by others, when we are attacked by the devil, by 
the world and by enemies. And so this is beautifully 
connected, as if he wanted to say: they will see how 
| was crucified for them, yes, how they themselves 
crucified me. For he bore our sins, says Isaiah [Cap. 
53, 11.]. Therefore they immediately say with the 
apostle Paul [Gal. 5:24], "Those who belong to Christ 
crucify their flesh together with lusts and desires." 
They gladly bear poverty, hunger, weakness and any 
kind of adversity, even if life has to be put in danger, 
all of which is certainly hard and deserves the name 
of the cross. And this affliction is like the affliction for 
a first child, that is, harsh and violent. 


V. 11: At that time there will be great lamentation in 
Jerusalem. 


This is an extension of that mourning. "At 
Jerusalem," that is, in the Church of Christ. 


Like that was with HadadRimon in the field 
Megiddo. 

He looks back to the holy history [2 Chron. 35, 22. 
ff.] of the death of the very godly king Josiah, who, as 
he wanted to fight against Necho, the king of Egypt, 
was killed by bullets. This death gave all Israel cause 
for very bitter mourning, as can be seen in the history 
of 2 Chron. 35, 24. The prophet Jeremiah also wrote 
a lament or funeral song for him. Such great sorrow 
arose when the godly and blissful king was taken 
away. Such mourning, he says, will also be in the 
church over the dead Christ; the godly will follow his 
death, so that they will be conformed to their Lord. 


V. 12: And the land will mourn, every generation in 
particular (per familias et familias). 

That is, one will lament in every family especially. 
For this is how the Hebrew language tends to 
connect two words when it speaks distributively, as 
in Genesis [4 Mos. 


2144 XXVIII, 185-187. interpretation of Zechariah (2.), 


Cap. 12, 12. 2145 





17, 2. 6. (?): 1) Attulerunt virgam et virgam, that is, 
each one a stick especially. The opinion is: In the 
synagogue, the people are separated according to a 
certain order, which the Jews still observe today, as 
the men take their place, the women also theirs. He 
reminds the people of this custom here, so that they 
could grasp the matter more easily, as if he wanted to 
say: Everywhere in the whole world the sexes will 
mourn in the church. But there is a special emphasis 
on the word "especially", as if he wanted to say: There 
will not be a certain general rule prescribed for the 
killing of the flesh, but each individual, not bound by 
any certain laws, will restrain his flesh according to his 
opportunity. The foolish pope and the bishops should 
have been mindful of this, who impose fasting on the 
elderly alike, without any consideration of age or body 
condition, just as they do on the monks 2c. St. 
Augustine, in a place where he prescribes the 
customs and ceremonies for his own, said most 
sacredly: Not equally for all, because you are not all 
equally strong. But the monkish envy has despised 
this, that of course one did not leave one nail's 
breadth to the other. This has also been the undoing 
of many: many have become senseless and have 
never again come to terms with what Satan intended 
with such foolish laws of ceremonies. Christians afflict 
themselves "especially," that is, each one martyring 
himself and afflicting his flesh as is fitting for him, so 
that the evil lusts may be subdued. For this is the right 
custom of torture. For every man has his cross, as 
Christ expressly says [Matth. 


1) In the second verse of the 17th chapter (according to the 
counting in Hebrew: Cap. 17, 17.) is this doubling. 





16, 24.]: "He takes up his cross and follows me." He 
does not say, "He takes up my cross. Thus the 
prophet very finely transfers the use of the synagogue 
to the spirit, that every Christian should deceive 
himself as much as he can bear, so that the lusts of 
the flesh may be killed, but in such a way that we give 
the body its glory, so that it may not perish. For we 
did not receive the body from God for this purpose. 
The Lord will set a measure for affliction, and the 
Spirit will teach each one how far he should afflict 
himself. The Lord will give us temptations that we can 
bear, and at the same time with the temptation also 
an exceedingly rewarding outcome, as the apostle [1 
Cor. 10:13, Vulg.] says. For everywhere the apostle 
condemns "the spirituality of angels" [Col. 2, 18.], 
which labors with food, clothing, and other such 
trifling things, since the constitution of bodies is 
unequal, and not all can equally endure the same. 
Therefore, | will not let the examples of the saints be 
forced upon me, be it that of Jerome or Bernard, who 
also tortured himself so much by abstaining from food 
that he could not distinguish the taste of oil from that 
of water. And although Jerome tormented himself in 
a strange way, lay down naked on the ground, and | 
don't know what else he did, all this could not dampen 
the heat and the evil desire of his heart 2c. One must 
strive to suppress the evil desires and all heart 
movements that fight against the spirit, anger, pride, 
envy, sloth, avarice, unchastity 2c. So much is lacking 
in the fact that the monks have subdued these by 
abstaining from food, that rather they have ruled 
primarily alone in the monasteries. And this is the 
appearance of the church according to the inward 
and outward man. 


2146 L. xxvm, 187-189. interpretations on the prophets. 


2147 





The thirteenth chapter. 


The prophets, who had the custom of the law and 
the ceremonies in the law, had at the same time the 
understanding of the future things, because the Holy 
Spirit taught them inwardly. Therefore, they often use 
the legal things as proverbs, often as images. 
Zechariah does the same in this passage. For after 
he has described the state of the church in relation to 
the justification of the Spirit and the putting to death 
of the flesh, he now plays, as it were, with a secret 
interpretation, and confirms what has gone before, 
whether to amuse himself or out of the fullness of the 
Spirit. The apostle did the same in his letter to the 
Galatians [Cap. 4, 22. ff.), when he speaks of the son 
of Abraham, who was born according to the flesh .and 
of the right seed according to the promise, finely 
distinguishing between the fleshly children and the 
right spiritual seed, which is of the faith of Abraham 
2c. It is therefore the opinion of this passage: We 
have in the legal usages divers and many washings, 
we are tormented with divers righteousnesses of the 
flesh (as the epistle to the Hebrews finely sets forth 
[Cap. 9, 10.]: "With meat and drink only, and divers 
baptisms, and outward holiness, which are laid up 
until the time of reformation. But Christ" 2c.). By the 
way, when this kingdom comes, in which everything 
depends on the spirit being made righteous and the 
flesh being put to death, as has been said, then the 
right washing will take place. This will be exceedingly 
different from those many outward ablutions 
commanded in the law. 


V. 1. At that time the house of David and the citizens 
of Jerusalem will have a free open fountain against sin 
and uncleanness. 1) 


"At the time," namely, of the New Testament 
under the kingdom of Christ. - "If a spring 


1) Vulgate: In <tis ilta since lons patsris aoinui David 6t 
dabitantibus dsrusalsrn in adlutionsin pseeatoris st 
nwnstruatas. This is what the interpretation refers to. 





be." There is an emphasis in the word "spring", as if 
he wanted to say: There will be a living vein of water, 
which is the word of the spirit, as Christ says in John 
[Joh. 7, 38. f.]: "From the body will flow rivers of living 
water. But this he said of the Spirit" 2c. This spring 
cannot be dried up and exhausted, as happens with 
washing vessels, nor will it fall into decay, but will 
always be fresh and bubbling, as also John says 
[Cap. 4, 14.]: "That quilteth unto life eternal." - "Which 
is open" or "freely open," that is, poured out in 
common, publicly given to the whole world. But 
always, as | have said, the prophet turned his eye to 
the law and the legal usages. There were also in the 
law many vessels for washing, but they were set up 
in a certain place, everything was enclosed and 
limited by certain places, times, also by persons. To 
this being bound by law he contrasts grace, which is 
offered through the gospel throughout the world to all 
nations, as he adds: "To the house of David." That is, 
not merely for Levi, as in the law of Moses, but also 
for the house of David, yea, also for all the 
inhabitants of Jerusalem, that is, for all believers in 
the whole world. For | have mentioned this above, 
that the prophet thus uses these words in a spiritual 
way: house of David, inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
Israel, Judah 2c. - "For the washing away of sin." The 
Hebrew does not have the word "wash away," but it 
is not evil added. But so the Hebrew reads: in sin and 
in separation, as if to say, This fountain will be 
prepared both to take away sin and against 
uncleanness. But there are two kinds of 
uncleanness: one that is dependent on the will, the 
other is in nature. The impurity dependent on the will 
cleansed the outward washing of the law; the natural 
we could not prevent. Therefore, a twofold 
purification was 


2148 xxvm, i8g-i9i. Interpretation of Zechariah (2.), Cap. 13, 1-3. 


2149 





appointed to cleanse sins, [the one for those] which 
we do ourselves, 1) as there was when someone had 
touched a dead man, a leper, a woman having her 
blood flow 2c., the other for the cleansing of natural 
sin, as there was the uncleanness of women from 
childbirth 2c. All this can be seen in the third book of 
Moses. 

Now the prophet alludes to these legal things as if 
to say, "We who are under the law are afflicted with 
many impurities. The law makes many things 
unclean, and so we are tormented with the 
purification of all these impurities. But everything is 
ridiculous, it is not serious. But the task of cleansing 
the sins and the right impurities will be the Holy Spirit, 
who will finally cleanse the present and the past sins. 
Therefore, | call sin here actually the original sin with 
all its fruits. The Holy Spirit takes these away 
completely, but there still remains the impurity in the 
flesh, which is the blood-fluid or impure woman. But 
the Holy Spirit encourages and comforts the heart 
through the grace that sin is forgiven, so that it no 
longer fears condemnation or judgment because of 
sin. Then, after the heart is thus justified, Christians 
crucify their flesh more and more every day, so that 
the remnants of the old man may be cleansed, and 
so gradually the flesh may also be cleansed, until it 
perishes completely. And this is what the prophet 
abundantly said in the previous chapter about the 
justification by the Spirit and the affliction of the flesh 
in all generations [Cap. 12, 10. ff]. 


In that day, saith the LORD, | will cut off the name of 
the idols out of the land. 


Again, he compares the Old and New Testaments, 
as if to say: In the Old Testament, people struggled 
to drive out idols. This was done by many godly kings 
who destroyed the idols' statues and the groves. But 
they could never destroy the names of the idols. 

1) Thus Luther himself, in the previous relation, expresses the 


opinion of votuutariis. - The immediately preceding insertion (of altsra) 
seemed necessary to us. 





tigen. Everything that has therefore been carried out 
by them has only been accomplished according to 
the letter. But the New Testament stands in power; it 
not only takes away the idols, but also the names of 
the idols. For when the truth is known, when the Holy 
Spirit is sent, the idols fall away of their own accord. 
They are not broken with the hand, but by the Spirit, 
for those who have the Spirit of GOD are free from all 
idolatry. But he says according to Hebrew "the names 
of idols". Thus the prophet also used it in the Psalm 
[Ps. 9, 7.]: "Their memory has perished along with 
them," that is, their praise and esteem. For this 
means to remember someone, as Christ also says, 
"Do these things in remembrance of me." That is, 
praise, proclaim, extol and honor it, that my esteem 
may be increased. But the memory of the Jews has 
perished, that is, they no longer have a priesthood or 
a kingdom; all theirs is infamous and lowly. And this 
is what the Scripture calls: that God forgets us, as it 
says in the Psalm [Ps. 16, 4]: "I will not take their 
name in my mouth" 2c. 





| will also drive the prophets and unclean spirits out 
of the land. 

That is, not only the service of idols, but also the 
teachers of this service | will take away after the Holy 
Spirit has been sent. He distinguishes the Holy Spirit 
from the unclean spirit, because only the Holy Spirit 
is that freely open and ever-springing; all other spirits 
are unclean spirits. Thus, nowadays, after the Gospel 
is revealed, the impure teachers in the monasteries 
are removed together with the monastic clergy 
(religione), because they do not like the Word of God. 


V. 3: So that if anyone knows further, he should go. 

He uses a fine simile, but still compares the Old 
Testament with the kingdom of Christ. Everything 
ungodly, he says, shall be cast away, the laws, the 
doctrines and the ungodly teachers, likewise those 
who will say that they have new visions. For the 


2150 L. XXVIII, 191-193. interpretations on the prophets. 


2151 





Christians distinguish sharply between the voice of 
Christ and the stranger, as Christ says [Joh. 10, 4. 5.]: 
My sheep obey my voice, but from a stranger they 
flee 2c. It is therefore the opinion of this passage, as 
if he wanted to say: In the old testament teachers and 
judges were appointed, who should judge about the 
visions and prophecies, but this will completely cease 
in the new testament, because all, from the smallest 
to the greatest, will know me, since all have the same 
spirit. In sum, he shows that the power to judge the 
false prophets will be with all Christians. 


Let his father and mother, who begat him, say to 
him. 

That is, those from whom they have been 
previously instructed. 


And so the father and mother who begat him will 
cut him to pieces. 

Namely with the word of the spirit. We see the 
same thing happening in our times. For our children 
also want to bring forth new visions and a new 
teaching. But because they prophesy false things in 
the name of the Lord, we cut them to pieces 2c. 


V. 4 For it shall come to pass in that day that the 
prophets shall be put to shame with their visions. 

From the following it is clear of which killing or 
stabbing he speaks, namely of the friendly scolding of 
the godly, who would like to see the godless turned 
away from their error. For the false prophet himself 
will say afterwards [v. 6], when he is questioned about 
the wounds in his hands: "Thus am | smitten in the 
house of them that love me" 2c. He is therefore 
speaking of the spiritual bruising. But concerning the 
defeat of the false teachers the apostle Paul says: 
"Their foolishness will be revealed to everyone,” for 
they will finally be put to shame after their error is 
made manifest, and cannot stand in judgment, as it is 
said in the first Psalm [v. 5]. All this is said for the 
comfort of the church, that the false teachers shall not 
prevail, but shall be put to shame 2c. 





And shall no more put on a rough cloak, that they 
may deceive. 


Thus we see that the prophets used a special 
clothing by which they could be distinguished from 
others. Thus itis said to Isaiah [Cap. 20, 2]: "Remove 
the sackcloth from your loins." But the sackcloth is 
the very worst clothing that the prophets used, 
because they were always switching and biting the 
people, and so the clothing and the teaching 
coincided with each other. Such was also the hard 
and rough garment of John the Baptist. Therefore, 
the opinion of the passage is: "The outward use that 
makes hypocrites will also be removed. No longer 
will false prophets be able to deceive Christians 
under the pretense of right and godliness, for 
Christians, taught by the Holy Spirit, will judge any 
falsification of doctrine, no matter how much false 
teachers pretend to right doctrine and godliness. No 
pretense will deceive the Church; the godly will 
immediately hold the teaching of false teachers 
against the Word of God, and examine whether it is 
similar to the faith. 


v. 5. But shall say, | am no prophet, but a 
husbandman. 


That is, the false prophets will be humiliated, 
convicted and disgraced that they do not want to be 
prophets. They will no longer have a hopeful or high 
opinion of themselves, but will easily give way to 
anyone who admonishes them. This is what the 
apostle wants, that the Christians are unanimous in 
their attitude, that one hears the other, that one 
follows the other, that they do not bite or quarrel 
among themselves, but that one precedes the other 
with reverence (Rom. 12, 10.). It is therefore the 
summa of this passage: | will no longer follow these 
heresies, but | submit myself to the unity of your faith; 
| no longer exalt myself or praise myself exceedingly 
insolently, as before. For | am

| am too little to offer myself under the name of a prophet. 
But the prophet alludes to the way of earning a living 
among the Jews, who, since they had no trade, lived on 
fruits and cattle, following the example of the patriarchs. 
For this was the rightest and best way in the sight of God 
to gain a living, without all usury 2c. 


| have served people (homo possedit me) from my 
youth. 


These are words of confession and humiliation, by 
which he submits himself to the judgment of others, who 
judge more correctly about godliness, and lets of his kind 
by indicating that he is not different from others of the 
common people. But it is a Hebrew way of speaking, 
since he says: possedit me. It is also written in Genesis 
4:1: Possedi hominem per Deum, that is, | have 
obtained him. Likewise [Proverbs 8:22, Vulg.], "The 
LORD possessed me in the beginning of his ways." We 
translate it quite actually by the word "have," which the 
Hebrews lack. The opinion, therefore, is, | have been 
with farmers in the pastures and in the fields from my 
youth, so much is lacking that | should have learned 
anything of mysteries or new revelations concerning the 
divine majesty. All these things the false prophets boast 
that they know; | will follow them no more. 


V. 6. What are these wounds in your hands? 


Bruised, disgraced, and humbled by the Word and 
the Spirit, he has wounds, that is, signs that he is 
disgraced. Signs that he has been put to shame. But 
when he is questioned, he answers that they are good, 
kind and loving wounds, namely paternal, as if to say: 
"Those who begat me in Christ, from them | received 
these kind wounds, because the church strikes by 
shouting, not raging with force or weapons, but so that it 
may call hearts back from error and win many souls for 
Christ. 2c. 





V. 7. sword, open upon my shepherd. 

There seems to be no connection between the preceding 
and the following part of this chapter, because the 
prophet has so far dealt with the kingdom of Christ, how 
the faithful are to be justified in the spirit, and how, after 
the law with the ceremonies is done, they are to be put 
to death according to the flesh. And immediately he 
brings in that of the shepherd that shall be smitten, and 
of the flock that shall be scattered. But one thing was 
missing in this prophet so far, that he explained the 
previous vision of the stone to be cut out, which he 
presented above in the third chapter [v. 9]. Therefore he 
interprets that vision here with clear words and 
revelations. That is why | connect this part with the 
previous one: The prophet has described the kingdom of 
Christ, how it will be constituted, now he continues to 
describe who will be the head or prince in this kingdom, 
and how this head must be constituted, likewise how this 
kingdom should be set up. Therefore, in sum, the 
prophet indicates two pieces. The first is: this kingdom 
must be established in a far different way than it can be 
understood or believed by the world, namely through a 
defeated and humiliated shepherd, as it is also depicted 
in Isa. 53. That is to say, the kingdom of Christ is a 
kingdom of offense, for many will take offense at your 
defeated king and fall back, since hardly a few remnants 
will be preserved. And this is said against the carnal 
delusion of the Jews, that not all should be admitted to 
this kingdom, but many would fall back, vexed by the 
lowliness and the wounds of this king. The other piece is 
that a godly man should know that all this was done by 
decree and according to the will of God the Father, that 
the shepherd is smitten, and Christ himself says in John 
[Cap. 11, 49.]: As the Father has given me a 
commandment, so do | 2c. It is therefore God's good 
pleasure that this King first suffered and was humbled; 
at last he will be crowned with glory and honor. 

But we should not be concerned that the evangelist 
Matthew [Cap.26, 31.] this passage. 


2154 L. XXVIII, 195-198: 


in another person. For it does not matter in which 
person it is said, since it is the same opinion, as | 
have also widely reminded above. It is certain that in 
Matthew it is said in the person of God the Father, but 
it is completely the same opinion here, since God tells 
the sword to strike. These things are too small for us 
to dwell on, but Jerome holds them very high. 


About the man who is closest to me. 


That is, with me or beside me, as John also says 
[Cap. 1, 18.]: "The Son who is in the bosom of the 
Father, he has declared it to us." Therefore the 
opinion is: My most beloved Son, who is in my 
bosom, whom | have appointed king, my native, | will 
so smite that the whole world will be offended at him. 
For through the cross and death he will obtain that 
eternal and exceedingly glorious kingdom. And this is 
what is said in the Psalm [Ps. 8, 6. Heb. 2, 7.]: "Thou 
hast made him lack a little time of angels; with praise 
and honor hast thou crowned him, and hast set him 
over the works of thy hands" 2c. But the sword means 
persecution and crucifixion. 


This is how the herd will scatter. 

That is, many will be angry, even the apostles 
were scattered. But it seems to me that this statement 
is made in general, not only about the small part of 
the time when the apostles fled, but also about the 
whole time of the kingdom of Christ. For at that time 
Christ began to be beaten, and he will be beaten until 
the end of the world, as often as the wicked persecute 
and oppress the Christians, likewise when heresies 
arise, which also Christ says [Acts 9:4]:. "Saul, Saul, 
why persecutest thou me?" The opinion is therefore: 
this Christ is set for the fall of many. Always he is 
oppressed, always he is beaten. Therefore, always 
many are annoyed and are shattered. Thus, at the 
time of the Arians, Christ was miserably beaten and 
afflicted throughout the world, since with great 
unanimity all the best and most learned people 
denied the deity of Christ. Therefore, we must be sure 
that

That sword is also drawn against our Christ today. 
Thus he is spit upon, crowned with thorns, crucified 
and blasphemed to this day by the godless teachers 
and persecutors of the church, as he was spit upon 
by the Jews. If we were not completely sure of the 
word of God, all this could give us a reason to despair. 
If we were not completely sure of God's word, all this 
could give us reason to despair and abandon the 
word, since we see the great bitterness and the great 
rage of so many and extremely powerful enemies of 
the word, who all want to see the word destroyed and 
suppressed in every way. Therefore, the striking of 
the sword is necessarily followed by the scattering of 
the host, which we have experienced more than 
enough nowadays, since many flee from the gospel 
who seemed to be on the side of the gospel before 
the striking. And the whole crowd at first received the 
gospel with great acclaim; but they jump away and 
get angry, so that hardly few persevere. Thus Christ 
is a reproach to men, and a contempt of the people 
for our sakes; but when we are gone, then shall it at 
last be made known that this our King is the Lord of 
glory. 

All this is said to us for our comfort, so that we will 
not be offended by the reputation of the defeated 
Christ, which is otherwise so great that if God did not 
leave us alittle, we would all become like Sodom and 
Gomorrah [lIs. 1:9]. It is God's power that we do not 
leave the defeated king. For this is by all means 
something too great for the world and human reason 
to accomplish. Here the powers of free will are 
nothing. 


So | will turn my hand to the little ones. 

That means, in this trouble, in this case of many, | 
want to keep my remaining ones, my little ones, 
otherwise all who are the highest and best in the world 
will stand against Christ, as Paul | Cor. 1, 26. f. says: 
"Not many mighty, not many noble are called, but 
what is foolish in the world, that God has chosen" 2c. 
And Christ seems to have often looked at this 
passage, since he so often remembers the little ones 
in the Gospel story.

V. 8. 1) And shall come to pass. 
That is, this is how it will come, this is how it will 
happen in all the lands, not just in Judea. 


In whichever country there are two parts, they shall 
be exterminated. 

He himself interprets the trouble and what he 
wanted to say with the scattering of the flock, the 
defeated shepherd and the miraculous preparation of 
this glorious kingdom, as if he wanted to say: The 
gospel will be marveled at, no one will easily believe 
it, as Christ also quotes from the Psalm [Ps. 118, 22. 
f.]: "The stone that the builders rejected has become 
the cornerstone. This is done by the Lord, and is a 
wonder in our sight," that is, He gives us exceedingly 
great impetus, and if we were not exalted by God, we 
could not persevere. The same is held up to us here, 
since two parts are scattered and fall away, only one 
part is preserved. Thus the larger part always 
perishes, the smaller is preserved. At first, when the 
gospel is proclaimed in the world, it is heard with 
great acclaim; there are few who do not admire it. But 
when the sword is drawn, when the shepherd is 
struck, two parts immediately jump away, guided by 
their reason and the cleverness of the flesh. They 
cannot suffer the pain of the cross, and who could 
suffer it if he were not encouraged by God through 
the Holy Spirit? For to believe in life in death, honor 
in disgrace, righteousness in sin, peace and God's 
favor in the greatest persecution: this is truly beyond 
all comprehension of reason and indeed a miracle 
before our eyes. 


V. 9. and will lead the same third part through the 
fire, 

We must suffer the shame of the cross of Christ, 
says the apostle; the weakness of our King is 
reproached to us; meanwhile he presses his eyes to 
the branches-.

of the ungodly and remain silent. In addition, we must 
also bear our own special sufferings, each according 
to the cross laid upon him by God, so that we may 
make up for what is still lacking in tribulations in 
Christ, as the apostle says in the letter to the 
Colossians [Cap. 1, 24]. And this is what he calls 
here: being led through the fire. But this, he says, will 
be a test for you, that you will be proved by the cross, 
just as silver is proved by fire. There are many today 
who act the gospel to our great shame, newcomers 
who have never been exercised by the cross. These 
are a part of the sword against us. While they sit 
securely under our peace and under our fig tree, they 
nevertheless rage against us. If they were also 
threatened with danger, if they were also oppressed 
by misfortune and the cross, then they would learn to 
cling to the goodness of God alone and despair of 
their advice and inventions, which are otherwise a 
source of many heresies. For since they are not busy 
with important things, their hearts, which are open to 
idle thoughts, cannot help but invent new doctrines. 


They will then call my name. 

A similar passage has been interpreted above in 
Hosea 3). In sum, however, this passage has this in 
it: the kingdom of Christ, which is plagued both in His 
King Christ Himself and in our own bodies, is ruled by 
faith alone and by calling on the name of the Lord, 
which is also taught by the apostle Paul in his letter 
to the Romans [Cap. 10, 13. f.]: "Whoever shall call 
on the name of the Lord shall be saved. But how shall 
they call upon him in whom they believe not?" 2c. 
Therefore, this kingdom is not preserved with us by 
the protection of arms or our forces, but by calling 
upon our Avenger and Protector, who does not 
forsake those who call upon Him. Therefore, 
Christians must necessarily be secure against all 
violence and tyranny of the enemies and princes who 
conspire with each other against the Lord. They know 
that God cares for them. 


3) Such a passage is not found in Hosea. It will probably be "Joel" 
[Cap. 3, 5.) to be read.

They should only call, he is there who hears those 
who call. This is what Paul says [Phil. 4, 6.]: "Do not 
worry, 1) but in all things let your petition be made 
known in prayer before God." But one must call in the 
name of Christ, that is, in faith alone in Christ, without 
any reliance on our righteousness or holiness 2c. 


They are my people, and they will say: Lord, my 
God. 
This is the preaching of the gospel. For those who 


believe are sheep, are the property of Christ, in short, 
they are children.

God, co-heirs with Christ. Believers have this praise 
before the angels and before the Father. Then 
Christians also confess this in their hearts before 
God, and likewise with their mouths before the world. 
For in these two pieces is the sum of our justification. 
But this confession must necessarily be followed by 
the cross: immediately the world and the gates of hell 
set themselves against it. For the world does not 
suffer its powers, its righteousness and wisdom to be 
condemned, therefore it is most bitterly hostile to 
those who condemn it, persecutes them and 
removes them from the way 2c. 2)

Q. D. Martin Luther's interpretation of the prophet Malachi. *) 


Probably laid out in 1526; printed in 1552. 


About Malachi. 


The first chapter. 


V. 1. This is the burden that the LORD speaks 
against Israel through Malachi. 

The summa of this prophet is that he rejects the 
synagogue and describes it as contemptible, as it 
were, as an old hag, which is now 


should be abandoned. Therefore, almost all the 
words that are spoken here in the name of the Lord 
express a kind of weariness, lind the Lord is fed up, 
as it were disgusted with their ceremonies, which he 
has certainly held. 


*) Although the Zwickau manuscripts do not contain the interpretation of the prophet Malachi, and the Altenburg manuscript breaks off 


with the thirteenth chapter of the prophet Zechariah, it can be concluded that this interpretation also belongs to the same cycle of lectures as 
the previous prophets, and that it immediately followed the prophet Zechariah, thus belongs to the year 1526. Only the Hall manuscript, apart 
from the Wittenberg edition, also brings the explanation of this prophet. Our writing is printed for the first time in the Latin Wittenberg edition 
(1552), tonr. IV, toi. 6586, then in the Erlanger, tom. XXVIII, x>. 289, and finally in the Weimar, vol. XIll, p. 676, with the Haitian manuscript 
(complete) in the form of notes. In 1555, our writing was translated into German by Stephan Agricola and included in the German Wittenberger 
(1556), vol. VIII, p. 5626. From there it passed into the Altenburger, vol. VII, p. 701; into the Leipziger, vol. VIII, p, 621 and Walch, vol. VI, 
3586. We have replaced Agricola's good but outdated translation with a new one. The Erlanger also cites a single edition of a German 
translation (Agricola's?), which is found in the library in Berlin: "Der Prophet Maleachi. Mart. Luth. Wittemberge. Printed at Magdeburgh by 
Hans Walther."

until the time 1) of Elijah [Cap. 4, 5]. But they kept 
them for their own profit and advantage, not out of a 
fair but out of a stingy heart, considering God's honor 
as nothing. The whole matter, therefore, is this, that 
both the people and the priests defiled the 
ceremonies of God. The belly is the most powerful 
idol in every religion. Unbelief is the cause of avarice, 
which the prophet punishes the most here. Israel was 
then to some extent gathered from the remnants and 
brought back to Jerusalem, although the kingdom of 
Israel was not restored, and at that time all the tribes 
were mixed together. 


V. 2. 3.2) Il love you, says the Lord. So you say: With 
what do you love us? 


He begins with the advancement [of his 
goodness], as if he wanted to give valet to the people, 
who resent and do not recognize the grace of God. 
And such licks were the listeners of the prophets. 
God always seems weak in His people and cares little 
for them, but He wants our strength to be hidden in 
Him, and the weaker we are, the more powerful He 
wants to be in us. Thus Paul says 2 Cor. 12:10, 
"When | am weak, then | am strong." As if he wanted 
to say, | put my strength in GOD, and so | succumb 
in weakness, and triumph in weakness. This is felt by 
the spirit, not by the flesh, which rather feels that the 
world succumbs. Thus the prophets told the people 
that they had a gracious God. On the other hand, the 
people, when they saw the adversities and that they 
were in a bad way, thought that God was very far from 
them. Thus the flesh judges that God is far away 
when it lacks good, and again it does not recognize 
God's good will toward it and does not suffer the 
trials, but despairs. But God lets His own sink, yet not 
sink. He says [Ps. 55, 22]: "He will not leave the 
righteous forever in restlessness"; likewise Proverbs 
11, 8: "The Lord will not leave the righteous forever 
in restlessness.

right is delivered from adversity, and the wicked 
comes in his place." Therefore, these are words of 
faith and spirit, when God says: "I love you", | am 
favorable to you, |am a merciful Father to you. These 
must be looked at, not what is before the eyes. But 
the unbelievers, yes, even the saints, say ill 
protracted temptations: Where is your former mercy? 
2c. And the prophets are considered liars. 


Is not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD; yet 
have | loved Jacob, and hated Esau, and made his 
mountains waste, and his inheritance a desolation to 
the dragon. 


With an example he proves the love of God 
towards the people. Remember, he says, how | have 
preserved you in the midst of the tribulations which 
the Assyrians, Babylonians and others have stirred up 
against you; but Esau, who had the same claim to 
love because he was Jacob's brother, | have not loved 
nor preserved. But Jacob | have loved from the 
beginning and still to this day. From this you should 
certainly have known that | love you, even though love 
is mixed with cross and covered under it. If you look 
at the matter from the outside only, you will judge that 
Esau was loved more by God because he had 
dominion and was more powerful than Jacob. But all 
of God's works begin in weakness and are completed 
in power. If you are weak, wait; this weakness is a test 
of faith, whether you will trust in GOD or in your 
strength. Esau fell and was not raised up again, but 
even though Jacob fell from time to time, he was 
raised up again, which is a sign of my love for him. 
And he was raised up by his adversaries, by the kings 
of the Gentiles, Cyrus, Darius 2c. This did not happen 
to Esau, with whom it is now finished. Jerusalem did 
not become a dwelling place of dragons like the land 
of the Edomites. For the remnant of the poor people 
remained in the land of Judah, that they might 
cultivate it, that it should not become a desolation; 
kings and priests were preserved 2c.

V. 4. and if Edom would say: We are ruined, but we 
will rebuild the wilderness; thus saith the LORD of 
hosts; If they build, | will destroy. 


1) They shall not hope to be rebuilt as you are 
rebuilt, though you were destroyed before, that you 
may see that | love you, not the children of Esau 
(Esauitas). These will hinder the kings of the 
Persians, but they are favorable to you, as they have 
shown you favor by restoring to you the sacred 
utensils, releasing you, building with you, because | 
willed it. And yet, because of a little persecution, you 
say that | do not love you. 


Vv. 4. 5. And shall be called the condemned border, 
and a people against whom the LORD is angry for ever. 
Your eyes shall see this, and shall say, The LORD is 
glorious in the borders of Israel. 


There will be no end to the desolation of Edom. It 
is indeed a wretched building that the Lord destroys, 
whether it is physical or spiritual. Thus Christ says 
[Matth. 15, 13.]: "All plants, which my heavenly Father 
has not planted, are cut off." But this is called the 
destruction of the kingdom, when everything is in 
confusion, and there is no order; only the yeast of the 
people remains, and everything stands miserable. 
This is how it is in Edom. Although people will dwell 
there, God will not be with them, nor will there be 
worship, but sin and wickedness will remain, and the 
wrath of God will rest on them. The 137th Psalm, v. 7, 
says: "Remember the children of Edom in the day of 
Jerusalem" 2c., that is, as they did Jerusalem 2c. 
Whereas in the borders of Israel the LORD was 
glorious, he dwelt among them, and his worship was 
among them, and there were borders of godliness 
which the LORD loved. Here is the temple, the priests, 
the prophets. You see therefore, he says, that the 
Lord is still glorious among you. The sign of the 
presence of God is the presence of the Word of God 
and the right use of the sacraments. 


1) This section is missing from the Wittenberg and is inserted by

v. 6 A son shall honor his father (honorat), and a 
servant his lord. Am | then father, where is my honor? 
Am | lord, where do they fear me? saith the LORD of 
hosts. 


Now he nurses all ingratitude, contempt and 
neglect of God, who loves them, but especially the 
stinginess of the priests, by which they have harmed 
the honor of God, which is his knowledge and 
obedience to his word. But he gives the proof by a 
similitude: in nature it is so, that a son honors his 
father and a servant his master. But if nature does 
this, and it is so among men, how much more is it 
necessary that this should be done to me, who am 
God the Lord, and the most almighty and gracious 
Father of you all? And it is also a conclusion from the 
lesser to the greater (argumentum a minori). "A son 
honors," that is, he tends to honor or is to honor. "Am 
I" Adonim, that is, "lords." So it is written in Hebrew, 
indicating the mystery of the divine Trinity, or it is 
done for the sake of reverence, because GOD is the 
Lord of all lords. 


To you priests who despise my name. Thus you 
say: With what do we despise your name? 


Paul says [Rom. 2, 24.]: "In the same way God's 
name is blasphemed" 2c. But this happens in a 
twofold way, namely through teaching and life. The 
greater blasphemy, however, is in ungodly teaching, 
where the name of GOD is added to the lie. But the 
prophet speaks mildly here and says: You despise, 
since he speaks of doctrine. The other blasphemy 
happens with the life and the works, when we bite 
among ourselves, are hopeful, are devoted to avarice 
2c. And the whole world, of course, has the name of 
God in its mouth, but it is a blasphemy and a 
confluence of blasphemies, and this prayer: 
"Hallowed be thy name,” should make this life bitter 
and burdensome for us. You priests, then, who 
should glorify me before all, you more than others 
despise my name, and by false teaching make my 
name blasphemed, - and yet you want to defend 
yourselves and not be thought unjust.

for you say, "Wherewithal do we blaspheme thy name?" 
It is truly a frightening and dangerous thing that when 
someone is in a wrong choice, he not only blasphemes 
the name of the Lord, but also does not want to desist, 
and only protects his sect even more. The originator of a 
sect is converted to the truth with great difficulty or never. 
So they do not want to be accused of despising God, 
since they teach the glory of God and serve God most 
diligently, namely their God, who is their belly. But he 
answers, "By this you despise my name, 


V. 7: That ye sacrifice unclean bread upon mine 
altar. 

They had a commandment about the shewbread, Ex 
24:8 and Ex 25:30, 1) that they should be changed every 
Sabbath. They also had a commandment about the 
nature of the food. These were sometimes unclean 
because of their ingredients (materiam), sometimes 
because they were obtained by fraud and robbery. 2) 
And the priests taught that everything was_ pure, 
whatever was sacrificed, and however it might be. "Ye 
say," saith he, "the Lord's table is despised." These were 
not the words of the priests, but their sentiments. For to 
teach and believe that any sacrifices are pure, is just as 
if they said, The table of the Lord is nothing, and it is

matters not what things thou offerest, for thus hath the

much sown, but little brought in". The surest way to 
become rich is to seek first the kingdom of God and His 
righteousness, and then, says Christ [Matth. 6, 33.], all 
these things will fall to you. But we turn it around by 
seeking first money and possessions, and after that we 
want to hang on to the kingdom of God. But Christ must 
first be a beggar. First must come God's word and that 
which is God's. By the way, what Christ does not get, the 
fiscus takes. 3) And if God did not suffer deceit in 
ceremonies, He will suffer it much less in love. Also you 
speak, he says to the people: 


V. 8.9.4 ) And if you sacrifice one blind, it need not 
be called evil 2c. 
That is blasoheming God and the Law. 


Bring it to your prince. 

This is a conclusion from the lesser to the greater: a 
merchant will not accept a bright one that is only a little 
damaged, and GOD should accept that which is not filled 
to him? Do we not fear and honor GOtt in such a way, 
as if He were a mute idol? Bring something like this to 
your prince. What matter if he will be gracious to you, 
and if you will please him? And zero you ask God to be 
merciful to you for the sake of these horrible sacrifices. 
Moreover, you defend your godless nature: of course, 
this is how you will propitiate God! And now we certainly 
see everything full of deceit and avarice in the world. 


V. 10: Who is there among you who can shut a 
door? 

That is, God would have you have someone among 
you to shut the doors of the temple, so that you would 
not sacrifice in vain. So Isaiah Cap. 1, 12. says: "When 
you come in to appear before me, who will demand this 
from your hands?" 2c. It would be better to refrain from 
praying than to pray evil. It is evil to take only the 
semblance of worship; before the divine majesty all must 
be done earnestly.

V. 11. But from the going forth of the sun even unto 
the going down shall my name be glorified 2c. 


| will begin a new thing, he says, which shall 
please me. The name of the LORD is great, not 
because it is written with large letters, but by being 
praised, thanked, and commended for being merciful 
2c., namely, when it is esteemed great and gloriously 
praised. But this he opposes to the contempt of the 
name of GOD, of which he said above [v. 6. You 
Jews, he says, despise my name, but the Gentiles 
will esteem it great. Further, the name of the LORD 
is not held glorious by our works, but by the praise of 
the grace of GOD and His goodness and mercy. 


In every place incense shall be burned in my name, 
and a pure meat offering shall be offered. 


Paul interprets this sacrifice Rom. 15, 16, when he 
says: "That | should be a minister of Christ among the 
Gentiles, to offer the gospel of God, that the Gentiles 
might become a sacrifice" 2c. So by the gospel, as 
by a priestly instrument, he sacrificed the Gentiles, 
that is, he offered the Gentiles to God and presented 
them clean from sins, dead in body and flesh. And 
through the Gospel the old errors are destroyed, and 
the truth awakened in the heart, which confesses 
God, believes in Him, praises Him, yes, also kills the 
flesh. Therefore the mass is not the sacrifice of which 
it is said here, whether one may invent that it is done 
in faith (ex opere operantis), or that it is only an 
accomplished work (ex opere operato). 1) Otherwise 
fornication as a work done would not be a sin either, 
because the woman is a good creature of God, as 
they say of the sacrament. But all commandments 
are based on the position of the one who performs 
the work (in opus operantis), and it is not a question 
of how good the thing is, but whether you use it well 
or badly. And for a pure sacrifice, the purity of the 
sacrificer is required. This is what God intended, 
since He forbade that the blind, the lame, or the

have any defect shall serve the altar [Deut. 21, 17. ff.]. 
This is the new kingdom, of which God promises here 
that He will establish it, in which not carnal people are, 
but spiritual ones; "but whoever does not have the 
Spirit of Christ is not His" [Rom. 8, 9.]. Therefore the 
weak are carried in this kingdom, but only those who 
are not wholly without the Spirit. Those who have the 
Spirit of Christ, though few in number, are yet 
scattered throughout the world, and shine in all places 
through the gospel, which is everywhere, as lights in 
the world, that they may keep the word of life [Phil. 
2:15 ff]. Incense and grain offerings were the noblest 
sacrifices among the Jews, which they also offered as 
the best in the service of idols in all valleys and under 
all green trees. We interpret the incense as the 
prayer. Therefore, the word and the prayer are the 
two sacrifices of the Christians. Prayer should be 
done with thanksgiving and praise. The sacrifice of 
Christians is pure because they are without guilt, 
washed away by the blood of Christ 2c. The 
unbelievers do not sacrifice. Christians do not 
sacrifice anything weak, blind, lame, or reprehensible, 
but a righteous and acceptable sacrifice. If the heart 
is believing, sin is not imputed. Nor can this sacrifice 
be understood from the legal and Mosaic sacrifice, 
nor could it be done in any other place; but here he 
says, "in all places" and "among the Gentiles," who 
certainly could not all come to Jerusalem, and the 
Levitical priests would not have sufficed "in all 
places." 


Vv. 12 But ye profane it, saying, The Lord's table is 
despised. 


As he remembers the table, he speaks primarily of 
the loaves. 


And his sacrifice is despised along with his food. 2) 

More correctly [than in the Vulgate] it reads: And 
his shoot (or fruit) is despised along with his food. The 
table is as it were

the tree, the food, as it were, the fruit. Under the law, the 
table sprouted new bread every Sabbath, and the former 
bread was the food of the priests. As if to say: You 
priests say that both the new and the old bread are 
despised. Because you say so, that is, teach, therefore 
you despise the sacrifice. Fire was not on the table, nor 
does the Hebrew say: sammt dem Fetter (cum igne). 1) 
The table was defiled either by a fault in the loaves or by 
a fault in those who ate them; but most of all by a fault in 
the doctrine of those who made no distinction between 
that which was unholy and that which was not. 


Vv. 13. And ye say, Behold, it is but trouble. 


That is, hardly with great difficulty have we obtained 
these loaves. If we had better ones, we would sacrifice 
them anyway. God is patient and merciful, but He does 
not like to be tempted and despised. Avarice always has 
its lids and pretexts. Likewise, GOD is patient in what 
concerns life and walk, but not equally with the 
corruption of doctrine.

2169 


And cast it to the winds, saith the LORD of hosts. 


You have sought your benefit, you have sacrificed 
yourselves, not me. You are facing poverty, which you 
suffer through your fault, not mine, because you do not 
seek my honor first, but your gain. 


And you sacrifice that ina is robbed, lame and 
sick. 


This is what the Prophet says about other sacrifices 
in which they sinned in the same way. Nowhere did they 
keep the teachings of God, and yet never recognize their 
sin. Where a false delusion has crept in, false works 
follow. They pretended to be poor, and were robbers, not 
openly, but by deceit. Behold, this is a twofold sin: 
Offering reprobate things, and teaching that they are not 
reprobate. 


V. 14. 2) Cursed be the good man who has a male 
in his flock, and when he makes a vow, he offers an 
unfit one to the Lord 2c. 

This is the conclusion. "A little man", that is, a good 
one, without fault, a strong one 2c. Debile his weak, that 
is, an unfit, a frail. Among the Jews, the name of the Lord 
actually reigned, but the Gentiles honored it more than 


the Jews. Therefore, the rejection of the Jews is not far 
off.

V. 1. And now, you priests, this commandment is 
for you. 


Above they used poverty as an excuse for their 
avarice, therefore God threatens them here that he will 
send them poverty in truth. For what the wicked fears 
will come upon him. But everything depends on the 
administration of the word, therefore he addresses his 
speech mainly to the priests. For if the leaders err, how 
much will they err who are led? The priests 


are called shepherds and watchmen, because the devil 
is always in the midst of the children of God, and always 
awakens miserly people and corrupters of the Word. 
Therefore, we too must always watch over the Word.

2171 





To teach false doctrine in the name of the Lord is 
to blaspheme God. Paul says 1 Cor. 15, 15: "But we 
also would be found false witnesses of God" 2c. All 
teaching that concerns the conscience comes in the 
name of the LORD. "To give glory to the name of the 
Lord is to teach the truth, what pleases God and what 
is the right will of God. 


So | will send the curse among you and curse your 
blessing. 

"The curse" or the dissipation of goods. 
"Blessings" are called in the Scriptures the gifts that 
we have through God's blessing. So now those 
priests called it a blessing when they had filled their 
houses with stolen goods. But it is a curse, he says, 
and | will make it a curse”. | will make you poor. 


Because you do not want to take it to heart. 
You did not recognize sin, did not pay attention to 
it, even defended it as a righteousness. 


V. 3. Behold, | will rebuke you with the seed, and 
cast the dung of your feasts in your faces, and it shall 
cleave unto you. 1) 

More correctly [than in the Vulgate it should read]: 
| will rebuke you the arm, that is, the violence, the 
service and the honor of the offering and the teaching 
| will take from you. The prophet may have had in 
mind the law which gives the priests the right 
shoulder from the sacrifices of thanksgiving; but the 
dung was carried out of the camp. This, he says, | will 
reverse: the shoulder | will take away from you, and 
the dung | will throw in your faces. You seem to be 
clean to yourselves, as if you do not sin against me; 
you cleanse the outside on the vessels, but inside 
you are full of uncleanness, deceit, avarice, belly care 
2c. Therefore | will not only take away the priesthood 
from you, but | will also add disgrace, namely the 
dung that you will never wipe off. On the feast days 
the highest purity was with the priests outwardly, but 
inwardly the highest impurity, the highest avarice. "It 
shall stick to you," that is, | will throw you out with the 
dung, or: as you throw out the dung.

V. 4. Then you will know that | have spoken this 
commandment to you, that it should be my covenant 
with Levi. 

Et scietis, that is, you will learn that it was my 
commandment that you should not do such things. - 
With Levi" means the covenant made with the whole 
tribe of Levi, the commandment given through Moses 
that they should teach rightly and not deceive anyone. 


V. 5. For my covenant was with him for life and 
peace. 

"My covenant." This is a prize of the good priests, 
to the shame of the wicked. The first priest Aaron was 
righteous. 

"To life and peace," that is, to bliss and security. 
These are given to those who fear God, as Aaron and 
other saints are, who did not dare to utter even one 
syllable apart from God's word. The heretics do not 
fear God. Fearing God is not in human powers, but 
He says: "I gave him the fear" 2c. 


V. 6. The law of truth was in his mouth. 

If a teacher is not corrupt, the word of God remains 
pure, while the hypocrites teach corruption and evil. 
Now that godly priest taught the law rightly and purely, 
he did not make hypocrites, he punished works that 
had a beautiful appearance of outward holiness and 
vain confidence, because the law teaches to 
recognize sins. You, who are priests now, have a 
false law in your mouth. 


And no evil was found in his lips. 
That is, he did not falsify, he did not twist the word, 
he did not add to it, nor did he take away from it. 


He walked peaceably and sincerely before me, 
converting many from sins. 

This is said of the way of life and the good 
example. Good doctrine is followed by good works; a 
good tree bears good fruit. Mecum, that is, "Before 
me." He annoyed no one, he did good to everyone, 
he did what he was supposed to do. 


2172 xxvill, 301-303. interpretation of Malachi, Cap. 2, 6-10. w. vi, 36Us-3607. 


He did not seek his own, he shared what he had. Behold, 
here the prophet sums up all Christianity, which is faith, 
peace, and equity. "And converted many." With a priest 
thus constituted, the fruit and efficacy of the divine word 
follows, for there is the Holy Spirit. He turns away, if not 
all, yet many from unrighteousness. 


v. 7: For the lips of the priest shall keep the 
doctrine. 


God could instruct and justify by His Spirit whom He 
wanted, but it pleased His wisdom better to instruct and 
save those who believe by foolish preaching [1 Cor. 
1:21]. The Word is the channel through which the Holy 
Spirit is given. This passage serves against the 
despisers of the oral word. The lips are the public 
receptacles of the Church, in which alone the Word of 
God is kept. For if it is not preached publicly, it decays, 
and the more it is preached, the more it is retained. 
Reading does not avail as much as hearing. The living 
voice teaches, admonishes, defends, resists the spirit of 
error. And the devil does not care about the written word 
of God, but when the word is spoken, he flees. For this 
pierces the hearts and leads back the erring ones. Paul 
says Gal. 4, 20: "| would that | were now with you, and 
that my voice might walk" 2c. The living voice preserves 
the law and doctrine, instructs the ignorant, reproves the 
erring, condemns those who falsify. The scriptures bring 
forth only more blasphemies. "Doctrine", that is, the 
description and right knowledge of [divine] things, 
prudence. Therefore the lips of the priest are instruments 
of blessedness for others; and they keep the doctrine, 
not in their hearts, but in the hearts of those whom they 
teach, and those who are unlearned 1) will keep the law 
and the wil-.

God's will and desire from them. For God did not send 
such a priest as a scribe, but as an angel and apostle 
who is to do the work of the Lord with words. Therefore, 
such a mouth and such lips are instruments of God. The 
books keep the law privately, but the lips keep it publicly, 
and open, not closed lips keep it, that is, when they 
preach. 


V. 8. 9. But ye are gone out of the way, and offend 
many in the law, and have transgressed the covenant 
of Levi 2c. 


As if he wanted to say: You degenerate sons of such 
and such great fathers should be ashamed of 
yourselves, since you do in everything the opposite of 
what they did. - From the way,” that is, that [, your 
fathers], - "you vex," you give your hearers vexation, so 
that they stray and go astray. And you err and make 
others err with you, you bring not the right opinion but 
your own and another's, even though you say the words 
completely, and so you pour poison into the people 
under the word of God, which is the gravest sin. You 
make the covenant of Levi in vain or you violate it, for the 
priesthood is promised to Levi eternally before the other 
tribes. You have turned priests into wolves, thieves and 
robbers, and are therefore unworthy to carry out this 
office any longer. For, it is said [Hos. 4, 6.]: "You have 
rejected me, 2) therefore | will reject you again" 2c. As 
you have despised my name, so will | also make you 
despised and cast out among all nations, and will not 
accept your person, as you have not accepted the 
person 3) of my law. There is no respect of person with 
me as with you and all who do not teach purely.

2174 xxvm, 303-sos. Interpretations on the prophets. W. vi, E-mio. 2175 





To take a wife of a foreign nation, which he punishes 
as asin, and especially that it has been approved by 
the teaching: it is right; because they said, "Did not 
Abraham, the father of us all, take a foreign-born 
woman as his wife? Why should it not be lawful for us 
also? Is not our God also the God of the Gentiles? 
"Why then do we despise one another?" Why do we 
not do what our father Abraham, Judah and others 
did? But the Jews sought kinship with the Gentiles in 
order to have peace, because otherwise they were 
despised by the Gentiles. And the Gentiles gave their 
daughters a large dowry; therefore they also ruled 
over the men against the commandment of God, as 
those who bring a large dowry are wont to do. But it 
would be better to understand these words in such a 
way that the prophet admonishes them not to take 
foreign-born women as wives, while they despised 
their relatives and the Jewish women, and that he 
tries to move them by reproaching them for being of 
one blood: "Have we not all one Father?" 2c., and that 
they have One God: "Have not One God created us?" 
2c. And these are two excellent pieces that can serve 
to dissuade husbands from tyrannical behavior, 
namely, if they regard their wives as creatures of God, 
and that they have the same God with them. This is 
what Peter says 1 Petr. 3, 7.: Husbands should dwell 
with their wives with reason 2c. Here he also raises 
his eyes to God, indicating that God is honored when 
the woman is honored as a creature of God. 


Why then do we despise one another? 


Namely that he does not want to take his daughter or 
sister as wife 2c. XXX has two meanings, namely to 
despise and not to respect, as if it were nothing. If to 
a wrong is added the conviction that someone thinks 
it is right, then he not only despises it, but also thinks 
it is nothing. Thus the Jews despised their brethren, 
which served to desecrate the covenant of the 
fathers; not because the fathers established this 
covenant, but because it was established by the 
fathers. 





came to the descendants; this covenant is the Law of 
God. Therefore, there is an extraordinary disrespect 
for the law of God (which is also called an 
abomination), not only among the common people 
and in the countryside, but also in Jerusalem, where 
the rulers and priests are, who despise the 
commandment of God that one should not take wives 
from foreign peoples. 


V. 11. 1) For Judah has become a despiser, and 
abominations are done in Israel and in Jerusalem. For 
Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD, which 
he loveth. 


"The holiness of the Lord", that is, the law. Now 
the prophet looks with an attentive eye at the 
corrupters of the law. For if the teaching remains 
pure, there is hope that life can be easily improved. 
The rays of the sun remain pure, even if they fall on 
the dung and shine. And God keeps something holy 
among us, by which we are sanctified if we have 
fallen, that is His word, by which we immediately 
condemn the error we have committed, and the Lord 
magnifies it. "Whom he loveth,” namely, the Lord. But 
you have no conscience about it, because you falsify 
it in this way. 


And boo with a strange god's daughter. 


That is, he took the daughter of a foreign god to 
be his wife, and as a husband kept himself to her, 
recognizing her as his wife, namely, one who is of a 
foreign nation and is godless. 


V. 12 But the Lord will cut off the one who does this 
from the tabernacle of Jacob, both master and 
disciple. 

The Lord will destroy or cut off the man, so great 
is the guilt of falsifying the word, and no mercy is to 
be observed against such people. But in an evil work 
one must be patient with brothers and instruct them 
with gentleness. XX means a "master" or the one who 
awakens; it indicates the chiefs. Some explain these 
two expressions and by: op-.

ponens et respondens, others: auctor et exe- cutor.... 
The Lord will cut off those who cut off his law, be they 
who they will, princes, people and priests. 


V. 13. 1) You also do this, that before the altar of the 
Lord there are tears and weeping and groaning. 


The Lord has willed that He should not be served and 
worshipped in sadness, but in gladness. Be joyful, he 
says [Deut. 26, 11.], before the Lord 2c. By mourning the 
priests were defiled, but here all was full of mourning, 
because namely the Jewish women mourned because 
they were despised, and the Jews took wives from 
foreign nations; and from them the priests accepted 
sacrifices in mourning, contrary to the law. Thus does 
One Evil cause many. He says: All your sacrifices are 
defiled, and | am not given an opportunity to look at you 
or your sacrifices, which you think are pleasant and 
pleasing to me. In vain serves the god that vexeth his 
neighbor. It is said [Hos. 6, 6. Matth. 9, 13.], "| am well 
pleased with mercy, and not with sacrifice." 


V. 14. And so you say, Why this? 


Behold, the despisers and those who do not respect 
[God's word] also do not recognize their sin, yes, defend 
it. 

Because the LORD hath put between thee and the 


wife of thy youth, whom thou despisest. 


The Lord, he says, has sanctified the marriage state, 
and said [Gen. 2:24]: "Therefore shall a man leave his 
father and his mother" 2c., and has called the woman "a 
helpmate". That is, Behold the testimony and ordinance 
of God: the woman is God's gift; she shall therefore be a 
helpmate to the man, and the man shall cleave unto her 
with all his heart. But it is no small comfort for husbands 
and wives to have God's testimony. And they should look 
to this above all things. This is what the prophet says 
against the abandonment of women. 


1) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 


W. VI, 3610-3613. 2177 


Since she is your companion and a wife of your 
covenant. 


He explains what kind of a helpmate the woman is, 
namely a life companion, a woman of the covenant and 
the contract that God made between the spouses and 
that they themselves made with each other. 


v.15. So the one did not, and yet was of a great 
spirit. 


This is a refutation against the objection of the example 
of Abraham, as if he wanted to say: It is void that you 
say: The one, Abraham, has done it; he has taken a wife 
of a foreign people, therefore it is also free for us, and 
afterwards he has rejected her, therefore it is also 
permitted for us. It is exceedingly corrupt to imitate the 
actions of the fathers without being called by God to do 
so, and it is exceedingly harmful to teach such things; 
rather, one should imitate their faith and obedience to 
God's word. God wants to do and work different things 
through different people; this one should be the eye, that 
one the foot 2c. Let each one look at what he is 
commanded to do by God, not at what another does. But 
they wanted to imitate Abraham, and said: The holy man, 
who is our father, did this; his spirit is not quenched, and 
we who are his seed have the same spirit. The negation 
must be applied to both assertions, as is usual in 
Hebrew. 2) And the prophet answers: "It did not take 
place that you could hold this against me. Search history, 
and you will see that it is not as you think. For Abraham 
did not follow the lust of his flesh, did not seek riches, as 
you do, but he did so because he was compelled to do 
so in order to obtain the blessing promised to him by 
God. 


2) This sentence, which is difficult to understand, finds its 
explanation in the Hallic manuscript. In the Vulgate, the beginning of 
this verse reads: Nonne nnns keeit 6t resiannni sviritns ejn8 68t? 
About this Luther says: "This | would now read thus: Lt non nnn& keeit 
6t r68i<iuunr 8piritll8 6jn8. In Hebrew, the One negation negates both 
sentences..... The sense, therefore, is: it does not follow, or: do not 
hold out to me that the One, namely Abraham, has done this; and that 
which is left of his, namely Abraham's, spirit (that is, we), add: will not 
do it."

to obtain his own seed. For when he saw that Sarah 
was barren, he took a wife at Sarah's command; not 
a rich woman, not for kinship's sake, not for pleasure, 
not a strange maid, but the one who was in his house, 
thinking that perhaps through her would come to 
pass what God had promised before God had spoken 
about Sarah being the mother. So he did not do 
something forbidden, like you, but by command and 
by the power of God. And Abraham did not leave you 
his spirit, because you follow the flesh and seek 
riches. "Therefore beware of your spirit", Keep what 
is said to you: "He will cleave to his wife" 2c. You are 
commanded to take Jewish wives; abide by the word 
of promise by which the Spirit comes. God does not 
want Gentile offspring, but your offspring. 


And let no man despise the wife of his youth. 


That is, which you took in your youth. Some 
interpret according to the Latin text thus: Did not the 
One God make us all, even] the strange-born 
women? And they are 1) a remnant of his spirit. God 
willed that we should be left and few after the 
captivity, and what does the One God seek but the 
seed of God, that is, that we should multiply, even by 
whatever wives it may be. 


V. 16. But let him who is unkind to her depart, says 
the LORD, the God of Israel, and let him give her a 
covering of iniquity from his garment 2c. 


This is another objection, namely that one is 
allowed to cast out the wives on the basis of the law. 
The prophet answers like Christ [Matth. 19, 6. ff.], one 
should not leave the woman, nor separate the flesh, 
but let it be one. And the text of Moses does not say: 
If you are angry with her, but [Deut. 24, 1]: If she does 
not find grace in your sight, and you find any 
displeasure (foeditatem) in her. But if anyone wants 
to divorce her, he says, he will be punished for the 
transgression. 


1) Instead of sunt in our text, the Hall manuscript has: 8UMU8.

As if he wanted to say: If you want to do according to 
this law, which is given and set for the wicked, hard- 
hearted and unkind, then you shall also have the title 
that you are evil and wicked boys. For every one that 
hath put away his wife shall be accounted a violator 
and a wronger, a covenant breaker and a violator of 
the faith, in whom is no faithfulness and honor, 
because he hath done, not that which was right, but 
that which was not right. He shall wear this outrage 
and stain on his garment, he shall be marked to be 
known, namely with this title: This is he who could not 
bear the way of his wife. This stain covers him like a 
garment, as obvious and known as the garment. So 
Christ says Matth. 19, 8.]: "Because of your hardness 
of heart" 2c. Therefore you are hard and stubborn 
heads and unpleasant people, with whom no one can 
get along. Likewise, the dress sometimes means the 
outward change. Therefore the opinion is: Outwardly 
you want to appear as a holy and good man, you 
have a beautiful skirt, but | want to draw it, and make 
it obvious that you are an ungodly, unkind, unloving 
person 2c. None of the saints has repudiated his wife, 
but also from others in the people of God one does 
not read this, so that God also indicates by this 
history, 2) that law is only given to hard murderers 
and man-haters. But this is what the prophet 
punishes the most, that they not only acted wickedly, 
but also defended this by example and by the law, 
while this should primarily teach the knowledge of 
sin. But they wanted to excuse their sin by it, which 
is a doctrine of the devil. It was a great sorrow to 
Abraham that he had to reject his concubine, Hagar. 


V. 17. You make the Lord unwilling by your 
speeches. 

That is, you make the Lord displeased with you 
and ashamed of you. When the wicked see that they 
are doing well

and they prosper well, but those who serve God suffer 
much adversity, they say that there is no God, or that He 
is unjust, or that He is a liar; they also accuse Him of His 
promises. Yes, even the saints in their zeal have often 
murmured thus against GOD. It seems that the righteous 
should reign, but the unrighteous should be servants, 
but the opposite happens. But the kingdom of God 





tes stands in faith, it demands faith. And God comforts 
His own in the midst of tribulation, in the midst of death 
He makes them alive. Therefore, the words of the 
wicked are, "Where is the GOD who punishes?" 2c. By 
this, he says, you make the LORD distressed. Reason 
has a wrong judgment about God, and therefore Christ 
says Joh. 16, 8: "The Holy Spirit will punish the world for 
judgment" 2c. 


The third chapter. 


V. 1. Behold, | will send my angel. 


The people are weary, the preacher and the prophet 
are weary. They say, "Wait here, wait there" [Isa. 28:10.] 
2c. As much as we serve the Lord, the Gentiles fare 
better than we. But be of good cheer, he says, behold, 
salvation is already at the door, and this kingdom shall 
be changed, and there shall be an end of your 
murmuring and of the lamentations of the prophets, who 
think that they preach in vain. The godly will be 
separated from the godless, and the godless will no 
longer be more powerful and blissful. And all this is 
spiritual, and chiefly in the doctrine and efficacy thereof. 
Where there is the truthful gospel, there Christ reigns; 
there heretics and anti-Christians, ungodly and 
hypocrites are excluded, who remain in sin and death. 
In the old synagogue there were more godless teachers 
than godly ones. Two teachers who are opposed to each 
other cannot remain at the same time, and the people 
desire a more truthful and consistent teacher in whom 
they can trust. This is promised here by the Lord, who is 
to give the listeners a righteous and secure mind in all 
tribulations. He says, | will send you the right Malachi 
[XXXXX - my angel], who is John the Baptist. 


Who shall prepare the way before me. 


These are the words of Christ, although he himself 
states them differently. The prince who wants to enter a 
city sends messengers ahead of him to prepare what is 
necessary for him, and others who 





make room for him, so that he would not be hindered by 
the influx of the people, XXX means to make empty, to 
make room, or also to make an appearance. John will 
therefore make that the appearance of the way be 
beautiful and spacious. For the way, that is, the work of 
the Lord, is hindered by many things that must be 
removed, but especially human reason, self-love, one's 
own wisdom, one's own righteousness 2c. Therefore, to 
prepare is to humble and to make them ready to let God 
work on them. For the way is the way of the Lord. Of our 
ways the prophet mentions nothing; only that we should 
turn from them. For our works are in the way that Christ 
cannot work or enter. John said to all the Jews, even to 
those who did the best works, "Repent" [Matt. 3:2], as to 
sinners. Let, he says, the Lord come in, he will make you 
righteous and do the will of the Lord, not you, not your 
works. That is, "punish the world for sin, for 
righteousness" 2c. [Those who believe in him are ready 
to meet the Lord and receive him; in these he can work, 
namely in those who have been brought to the 
knowledge of sins. 


And soon will come. 

Suddenly, unexpectedly, immediately after this angel. 
John 1:26 says: "He came in the midst of you, whom you 
did not know, who was before me," that is, he who was 
appointed to preach and to save. 


2182 L. XXVIII, 811-313. interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3619-3622. 


2183 





To his temple. 
Either your physical one or the spiritual one, which 
is the church. 


The Lord you are looking for. 

That he may deliver you from the wicked, who 
shall be your priest, and your king, and your patron. 
"The angel of the covenant," that is, the messenger of 
the covenant and the marvelous king who will reign, 
not in the flesh, as David did, but by the preaching of 
the word. The angel is such a one, who with a living 
voice delivers his office. "The covenant" 
(testamentum), these are the promises of God, which 
all aim at Christ, even the temporal ones. A testament 
requires death, so He is indicated here not only as 
GOD, but also as man who suffered, died, and reigns. 
That which is given out by the will is eternal life. 
"Behold, he cometh." The repetition indicates the 
certainty. 


V. 2. But who will suffer the day of his future? 

In the Hebrew it is written [instead of quis poterit 
cogitare in the Vulgate]: Who will distribute or govern 
the day 2c., or who will make provision, as if to say: 
Therefore remain in fear, humble yourselves, let this 
angel prepare you, for he will not come with great 
splendor, like the kings of the world; and before any 
man could make provision for when and how he would 
come, he will fulfill everything, mid no one will know 
that he is Christ. Hereby the prophet indicates the 
exceedingly great lowliness of the Word and the Son 
of God. And this is how his future is still today, namely 
unexpected. 


And who will stand when he will appear? 

This is what the prophet says about the 
astonishment of Christ. For he will appear as such 
and in such a small form that, unless you hear the 
voice of that first angel and follow the pointing of his 
finger, no one among you will receive him, nor believe 
that he is, but will say: Ei! is this the King who has not, 
as he lays down his head, crucified and dies? 
Therefore Christ Himself says [Matth. 11, 6.]: 
"Blessed 


is he who does not take offense at me," that is, who 
does not measure me according to reason. That is 
why the angel is sent beforehand, so that the light of 
reason may be extinguished, and it may be known 
that the carpenter's son is the Messiah. Many who 
saw him did not see him, for who will stand in faith? 


Because it is like the fire of a goldsmith. 

"The fire of a goldsmith" (ignis conflans) or a 
purifying fire, that is, he will condemn all your works 
and pretensions, and all yours will have to be killed, 
as silver melts in the fire and is purified, and is 
separated from all dross. means a sharpness or a 
soap with which great stains are washed out of the 
clothes. Thus Christ will reject all that is of man 1) and 
demand only that which is spiritual. This is very 
painful to Satan with his scales, and the Jews are 
puffed up with their righteousness, from which it is 
very difficult for them to be torn away from following 
Christ. The kingdom of Christ is a spiritual furnace 
that sweeps out the dross of the old Adam. But the 
prophet seems to speak here of white and linen 
garments, which are mainly used by the peoples of 
the East. These are cleansed with soap. Christ is not 
merely the purifier, but also the purification itself, not 
merely the goldsmith, but also the fire, not merely the 
washer, but also the soap. And he does not sit idly at 
the right hand of the Father, but works in us livingly 
and powerfully and without ceasing, flowing through 
his spiritual body as fire does through metal. And that 
is why he is called elsewhere the salutare (bringing 
salvation), not merely the Savior, that is, salvation 
itself and the workshop of salvation. This is felt by 
Christians, who are not moved by riches, fear death 
very little, and despise all temporal things. This power 
is the fire and the soap. 


V. 3. He will sit and melt. 


Sitting means the teaching office and the 
judgment. Therefore, it is a wonderful realm, 


1) The word tnirnnrm is missing in the Weimar.

2185 





which is not in outward weapons, but in the purification 
of men, in the renewal of souls, which are then brought 
to blessedness and eternal life. It is indeed a glorious 
thing, but in the spirit, but by heart all flesh is vexed. 


And purify the silver (Et mundator argenti). 


Thus it is said in the 12th Psalm, v. 7: "The speech of 
the Lord is pure, like silver that has been purified" 2c. 
The word of God is indeed in itself completely pure, but 
in us it is purified from day to day, because we are 
purified by the same. The Scriptures are the greatest 
light, but to the wicked they are darkness; God is very 
clear, but if you do not recognize Him, you are guilty. A 
light are these words: Christ is the purifier, 1) the 
righteousness, the redemption, the life 2c. The light, | 
say, can never be sufficiently seen, and it becomes 
clearer day by day. The matter is not in the sound of 
words, but in the innermost depths of the heart. And the 
sun is darkness for the blind, but not by its sder Sonnet 
fault, but the fault lies in the blind or in the closed eyes. 


He will purify the children of Levi. 


Now he explains what this purification of the silver is, 
namely the purification of the holy scripture for our sake, 
because all the women of the world fight and want to 
darken it. But while their dung stinks, the word of God 
becomes clearer and clearer, because finally their 
foolishness will be revealed to all. 2) The prophet shows 
that this is the purification of the holy scripture. But the 
prophet shows that the kingdom of Christ will be 
completely priestly, and there will be no distinction or 
respect of persons. Everyone in this kingdom will be a 
brother of Christ, and through Christ he will be able to 
go to God and pray and teach, and there will be other 
and true Levites, namely purified ones, after the old 
ones are rejected, who were only purified outwardly, but 
inwardly were godless and impure.

be read srnunaator. Vulgate: sraunaans. _ , : 

a Instead of ornnium, according to 2 Tim. 3, 9. orrinINus will be

And purify, like gold and silver. 


He will purify them, refine them, free them from 
impurities, separate the dross of false doctrine, so that 
the light of divine truth may be revealed through the 
Word by which they will be guided. The kingdom of 
Christ is an exercise of the Word and of faith, because 
of the constant attacks of the ungodly. Therefore, 
whoever wants to be a Christian must be prepared for 
purification. 


Then they will bring grain offerings to the Lord in 
righteousness. 


The sacrifice in righteousness is the sacrifice of the 
New Testament. For what need would there have been 
to promise sacrifices that had already been made? But 
the ones that happened at that time were all unclean, 
because the priests who offered them were unclean. But 
the sacrifices of the Christians are pure and righteous 
because they themselves are pure and righteous. Ps. 
132, 9: "Let your priests be clothed with righteousness" 
2c. Thus the prophet describes first the righteousness of 
the person, then the righteous work. Our sacrifice is the 
killing of the flesh, which is signified by the slaughter and 
the old sacrifice. But through the fire of the Spirit and of 
love, an exceedingly sweet odor is kindled to the Lord. 


V. 4. and the grain offering of Judah and Jerusalem 
will be pleasing to the Lord. 


If the people are pleasing and pleasant, the sacrifices 
are also pleasing and pleasant. 


Like before and long years ago. 


Namely, at the time before the law was given. For all 
these things are spoken for the reproach of the law. For 
with the law the hypocrites began; but the sacrifices 
before the law were acceptable to God because of faith. 
But the same faith, the same spirit, the same grace will 
be in the kingdom of Christ as it was before the law. Faith 
sacrifices voluntarily, the law compels unwilling people. 


V. 5. And | will come to you and punish you. 


After the prophet describes how it will be with the 
saints in the kingdom of Christ, 


2186 L. XXVIII, 315-S17. Interpretations on the prophets. W. VI, 3625-3627.

will be separated from the godly, 1) and the pure

obvious shameful deeds. | will come," he says, "by 
the word, to judgment; | will put under ban, | will 
condemn, | will punish. 


And be a quick witness. 
A punisher, a judge (censor). | will not cover up. 
The witches and sorcerers abuse the word of God, 
therefore they will be expelled. 


Against those who do violence and injustice to 
widows. 
That is, against those who rob them. 


V. 6 For | am the Lord who does not lie. 

| do not lie, | do not revoke what | have promised 
through so many prophets, and therefore do not 
doubt; your unworthiness will not prevent my 
truthfulness. In vain | have promised, in vain | will 
fulfill, and for this reason | have brought you back 
from captivity, so that | may fulfill my promises. 
Therefore, everything must be attributed to the divine 
goodness and not to any 2) merits of any man, for you 
have always sinned against me. And this, that he 
says [v. 7.], "From your fathers’ time," corresponds to 
what he said above [Cap.2, 17.], "He who does evil 
pleases the LORD," 2c., and he throws the blame 
back on them. It is therefore mercy that it is not over 
with them. 


V. 7. 3) Turn ye therefore unto me, and | will turn 
unto you also. 

These words seem to speak for the free will of 
man. But they are words of the law, to which it does 
not immediately follow that one can also do it. For he 
has just said that they never kept the law.

although they have started to keep it. God is indeed 
a good hottie, but we are slow doers. The law 
indicates what we should do. "Turn to me," he says, 
to obey me, "and | will turn to you" and bless you," | 
will be a kind, merciful father to you. 


Thus say ye, Wherein shall we be converted? 
The prophet has trouble with the holy hypocrites 
who do not want to be punished, nor are they aware 
of any sin or turning away from GOD. 


V. 8. Is it right for a man to deceive God as you 
deceive me? 

Affiget Deum or: that a man may do 
violence to God, or rob him, for you have robbed me. 
It is a Hebrew way of speaking. A similar passage is 
in Jeremiah Cap. 2, 10: "Go to the isles of Chittim, 
and see" 2c. And here God refers to the customs of 
the whole human race; everywhere the gods are 
worshipped with the highest care, and nowhere is 
anything robbed from an idol, but only from the right 
god among the Jews. By the way, he does not punish 
the life as much as the doctrine, because it "defended 
their sins", which is a sin against the Holy Spirit, 
which cannot be forgiven, because the lie is 
worshipped as something godly. Reason, which 
guides the Gentiles, teaches that robbing God 
(sacrilegium) is ungodly, but the Jews also defended 
this as right. Thus, in Pabstism, the idols are 
worshipped with greater diligence than the true God. 
Now that we should give to the servants of the word 
and to the poor, we are more eager to receive and to 
rob; before we were very willing to give. But before, 
we gave not a little to the deceivers and the open 
jacks. 


Thus say ye, Wherewith do we deceive thee? In 
tithes and heave offerings. 

There were two customs in the sacrifices. One 
was by simple lifting up, and these sacrifices were 
called theruma; the other was by the

2188 L. XXVIII, 317-319. interpretation of Malachi, Cap. 3, 8-13. 


The other was done by moving to the four regions of the 
world, which was called Thenupha. With these, he says, 
which you are to give for the maintenance of the priests, 
you do me violence and injustice. Furthermore, God has 
to do with it, not as if he cared about the tithes, but so 
that the ministry of the word might be preserved. 


V. 9 Therefore you are also cursed, so that 
everything slips out from under your hands. 


"And in poverty" [Vulg.] you are under the curse; in 
that all things melt away from you, you are cursed. And 
because you are robbing God against me, | make all 
yours to melt away, and you cannot rejoice in what you 
possess, 1) because God's blessing is not there, or more 
correctly: because you suffer poverty, and throw the 
blame on me, therefore you rob me of what is mine. 


V. 10. But bring the tithes. 


This is an exhortation after the punishment. He says: 
"That there may be food in my house", see to it that my 
priests may remain. First seek the kingdom of God 2c.; 
first satisfy me, and see if | do not satisfy you also. God 
is such a physician, who punishes to mend, wraths to 
pity, cuts to heal. In contrast, the devil only wounds, but 
does not heal again. It is a Hebrew expression: "to open 
the heavens" means to rain; to close the heavens means 
not to rain. 


V. 11. And | will rebuke the eater for you. 


The singular ["the eater"] stands for the plural: the 
caterpillars, the worms, which gnaw and spoil the seeds 
and fruits 2c. For what would it be if there were 
abundance in the fields, and the worms devoured 
everything? Ah! where is the faith here? God gives and 
sustains everything, and again He spoils when He wills. 


V. 12.7) You shall be a valuable land. 


All the heathen will desire to have such a land as you 
have, that is, the fertile land.

and protected against vermin. This is the punishment 
and admonition of those who regard the servants of God 
as nothing. But no one sufficiently comprehends the 
harm that results when the preachers of the Word of God 
are neglected. 


V. 13. You speak harshly against me. 


This is another sermon, and another rebuke of sin 
(which is also mentioned above at the end of the second 
chapter [v. 17]) 3) namely the grumbling of the Jews 
about the welfare of the Gentiles and about their own 
misfortune, since they were the people of God and kept 
the law, while the Gentiles did nothing of all this. And 
here more is said about the murmuring against those 
who dwelt among the Jews, namely against their 
brethren. Because the Holy Spirit had not yet been given 
and the mystery of Christ had not yet been revealed, they 
were reluctant when the prophets preached the 
promises of God, because they always saw the opposite 
before their eyes. The murmuring of the flesh against 
God is an affliction that is very difficult to overcome. 
Therefore he says: invaluerunt, that is, your words are 
harsh, sharp, violent against me, | can no longer stand 
your murmuring, your blasphemies. They were therefore 
with works robbers of God, with words blasphemers, and 
moreover they defended their sins. They say, "What 
have we spoken against you?" We have gone along in 
black, dark, lowly garments of mourning, 4) afflicted in 
soul, afflicted in body and life, and He has answered us 
nothing. God does not bless us abundantly, but we see 
that the proud, the stiff-necked, the presumptuous, the 
licentious, the insolent, the sacrilegious, the impudent 
lead a pleasant life and are blissful, and we must praise 
them blessedly.

he writes it in his book for remembrance, what they 
speak among themselves, how those comfort one 
another who fear God, and do not murmur nor 
grumble because of the welfare of the wicked. 


And remember his name.

godliness even though they suffer persecution.

"In that day" | will put an end to murmuring and 
blasphemy, they shall be my special possession or 
property, that is, it will be made evident that they 
belong to me and are already mine. And it is seen 
that this is said of the kingdom of the New Testament, 
for the people of the law have always murmured and 
blasphemed. 


And | will spare them, as a man spareth his son that 
serveth him. 

Here he promises that he will be a merciful father 
to those who fear him and serve him, that is, to the 
faithful. But since he says, "I will spare," he indicates 
that this kingdom will not be without sin, and 
therefore it will be a kingdom of grace and 
forgiveness of sins, a kingdom of sparing. And then, 
he says, you will see clearly what a great difference 
there is between the godly and the ungodly 2c.

The fourth chapter. 


V. 1. For behold, a day is coming that shall burn as 
one. 


All this is said of Christ, and this is spoken by those 
who fear God and comfort one another. Admittedly, 
the godly have everything against them for a time 
while they trust in the word, whereas everything goes 
well with the godless. But it will not always be like this 
with both, but until the hour comes 2c. "The day is 
coming, namely the kingdom of Christ.

has burned and consumed the whole synagogue.

so that nothing is left of it. 


But to you who fear my name, the sun of 
righteousness shall rise. 


In the kingdom of Moses there is only darkness, 
everything is hidden in secrecy 2) and confused. But 
then the wicked will be separated from the godly, 
namely when the clear truth of God shines through 
the gospel of Christ. Here you see that the kingdom 
of Christ is again described as being a ministry of the 
word. He says: There will indeed be a

The new sun will shine, but not the sun that animals 
see, but the sun of righteousness, which justifies, 
which sends out rays by which people are justified 
and freed from sins, by which all the harmful moisture 
of carnal desires is consumed. But the rays are the 
word of the Gospel which penetrates the hearts, and 
this sun is seen only with the eyes of the heart, that 
is, with faith, and is closer to the godly than our visible 
and bodily sun, because it shines day and night 
through the Holy Spirit and is not hindered by clouds; 
it is always rising. It will rise for those who fear the 
name of God, that is, for the humble, not for the 
presumptuous, not for those who trust in their works, 
but for those who recognize that they are sinners. 


And salvation under the same wings. 

Here you see clearly that this passage cannot be 
interpreted from the last day, when judgment will be, 
but now there is salvation and protection under the 
wings of Christ. Now the kingdom of Christ is such 
that he himself is the mediator and protector, as ahen 
defends her chicks against the hawk. Therefore, 
anyone who wants to be safe from the wrath and 
judgment of God, which the law urges, should take 
refuge under the wings of Christ. Under the law is 
weakness and condemnation, under the wings of 
Christ, under the gospel, salvation, strength and 
blessedness. The sun rises when the gospel is 
preached, under the wings of Christ one takes refuge 
when one believes. Therefore, even though you are 
a sinner, if you flee under his wings you will be 
healed; you will not fear death, you will not be 
overcome by the lust of the flesh. 


And you shall go out and come in, and increase. 


Here is the fruit of faith and the kingdom of Christ, 
namely, a joyful conscience and public confession, 
thanksgiving, joy in tribulation, preaching and 
converting others to salvation. - Instead of salietis 
[you will leap] it should more correctly read: you will 
be spread out, you shall dwell room

The Christian has to have what happiness has, while 
sadness narrows it down. A Christian thinks that the 
world is his, and goes out into the public, not looking 
for angles. 


Like the fattening calves. 
So, he says, you also will be fattened in the 
righteousness of faith, and valiant; your pasture is 
Christ. 


V. 3. You will tread down the wicked. 

They are always enemies of the church, or tyrants, 
or heretics, or false brothers. The heretics trouble the 
godly, but they finally become nothing, ashes, dust 
2c. The truth of the Lord abides forever. The fire of 
Christ will turn them to ashes, so they can be easily 
trampled. But first they will trample us, but finally the 
wheel will turn around; nothing grows from the ashes. 


V. 4. Remember the law of Moses, my servant. 

Malachi has now prophesied of the kingdom of 
Christ, but it is not yet here. Meanwhile, he says, you 
shall be shut up under the law until that sun shines 
forth. The law will last until the one who will not come 
without the messenger being sent ahead, who will 
say that he is present. Therefore, do not despise 
Moses and do not set him aside, who testifies to you 
about Christ and keeps you from evil. And when the 
time shall come for me to save you, | will send you a 
messenger in the spirit and power of Elijah 2c. This 
text is therefore the conclusion of the sacred 
Scriptures, the end of the Old Testament. Here the 
prophecy ends, and the messenger Elijah is 
expected, who is John the Baptist, who will lead the 
ministry of Elijah, which is to convert the heart of the 
fathers to the children, that is, that they may know the 
wisdom and faith of the fathers, that they may be of 
one mind in Christ, who are now divided into sects, 
as John found when he preached baptism unto 
repentance, seeing many Pharisees, Sadducees 2c. 
in short, that this one people had one heart, one faith 
2c. The time of the gospel is day, everything else is 
night and darkness. For Christ Himself is the Sun. 


2194 L. XXVIII, 323. Interpretations on the Prophets. W. VI, 3637. 


2146 5. 1) Behold, | will send you Elijah the prophet 
before the coming of the great and terrible day of the 
Lord. 

"The dreadful day, which makes the hopeful 
whole, and enlightens the humble. "The great day 
that does glorious things, makes alive, just and 
blessed 2c. 


1) This verse number is missing in Weimar's. 





V. 6 Lest | come and smite the earth with the ban. 


That is, to destroy it completely. Thus the 
Scripture uses this word XXX, "ban", which could not 
be loosed, but had to be destroyed. So that this does 
not happen to the people, but at least the remnants 
are saved, | will send John 2c.

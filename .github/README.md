# Luthers Works
This site contains the Walch Edition 2 of Luther's works, in 25 volumes and 22 446 pages.

Walch Edition 2 is based on [The Walch Edition](https://beggarsallreformation.blogspot.com/2009/10/walch-edition-of-luthers-works.html)[^1] published by [Johann Georg Walch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_Walch) (1740â€“1752).

[The Walch Edition](https://beggarsallreformation.blogspot.com/2009/10/walch-edition-of-luthers-works.html) was revised from 1885-1910 (in St. Louis), and may sometimes be referred to as _St. Louis Edition_/ `St.Lb`[^2]
